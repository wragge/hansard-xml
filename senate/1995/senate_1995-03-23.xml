Given that this is broadcast day, with due respect, Mr President, you should point out the two tests that are applied&mdash;not only the test of within the competency of the Senate but also the one laid down by former President Sibraa in November 1991, from memory, that it had to relate to public affairs. You are suggesting that you doubt whether the question of the Labor Party debt in New South Wales and the irregular accommodation given to it by the Commonwealth Bank is not a matter of public affairs, when it is on the pages of every single newspaper in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we are concerned to do is to now legislate to give effect to the policy that has been behind this legislation and that has been developed in debate and consultation since 1993. The consultation with the industry and consumers has been both prolonged and intensive. Well over 300 public submissions have been received and contributed to the development of legislation, and records of over 200 consultations that have been undertaken by the department were recently tabled in the Senate Community Services Legislation Committee during the Estimates procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>

The private sector casemix unit has in fact been developing over a number of years and has already received some application in the private sector. So a large part of the private insurance industry&mdash;the casemix area and private hospitals&mdash;has already started the process that will fit very well with the private health insurance legislation changes that are proposed here. The government believes it is important that we bring on these bills and not see any further delay with them.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill contains amendments to the funding and disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 arising out of the Government's response to the interim report of the joint standing committee on electoral matters entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Reporting by Political Parties</EMPHASIS> and out of further submissions made by the major political parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill deals with changes to four aspects of the Electoral Funding provisions of our electoral laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are simplification of paper work; the method of payment of the public funding entitlement to parties and candidates; an increase in that entitlement and provisions seeking to close loopholes in the disclosure provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Simplification of Returns</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for simplification of what the Committee rightly saw as unnecessarily onerous reporting requirements for registered political parties. Parties will no longer have to report particulars of their financial transactions in the minute detail the legislation required. The recitation of this minutiae served no useful purpose in achieving the policy objectives underpinning the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those objectives are of course to force disclosure of donations to candidates or their parties that might appear to influence a parliamentarian or political party's position in the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously the tens of thousands of small individual donations that are made at the time of elections do not fall into this category.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee in its wisdom recommended higher thresholds before individual donations had to be included or highlighted in returns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill raises the threshold figure from $100 to $500 and nominates $1,500 as the sum at which donors must report and be reported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the annual returns which political parties will be required to furnish under the proposed amendments will contain less detail than previously, the due date for furnishing them has been brought forward from 20 weeks to 16 weeks after the end of the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Payment of Funding</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the approach of simplifying procedures and avoiding unnecessary paperwork, parties will no longer be obliged to file a detailed election claim in the election year, regurgitating financial information that will also be in the annual return.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will however, have to lodge a return itemising major expenditure in respect of the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some time now parties have been complaining that payment of public funding has arrived long after the election. This was unavoidable in a system that required the parties to prepare highly detailed claims and lodge them and then have the AEC attend to the time consuming processing of hundreds of claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither the political parties or the AEC are over endowed with staff and the system placed great strain on their resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The long gap between political parties and candidates running up campaign debts and receipt of funding has led to campaign directors seeking bank overdraft accommodation against the future payment of their entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The service charges on such overdrafts could be very heavy, particularly if there were problems in processing the return.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That burden will now be substantially alleviated with the AEC making an interim payment of at least 95% of the entitlement on the basis of the parties known vote by the third Friday after polling day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At that point the House of Representatives count will be complete and the Senate close to completion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If certain proposals involving the provision of a computerised counting system for the Senate are implemented it is conceivable that the Senate count will also be completed by the last day that overseas postal votes enter the count. Otherwise the final payment could be slightly delayed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government holds the view that the public is entitled to know what is spent on election campaigns and the bill will reinstate the arrangement prior to 1992 when parties and candidates filed a return disclosing all significant expenditure such as broadcasting, publishing, printing, display advertising and opinion polls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Payments to National Offices</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also raises the possibility of payment to national offices. Until now, payment has been made to either State Branches of parties, regional parties or individual candidates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This did not take into consideration the reality that some parties were structured on a national basis and may want to fund an Australia-wide election out of their national office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Registered parties will now be able to direct the AEC to pay their entitlement to the national office of a party. This can only be done by mutual agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some State branches of parties may of course not wish to take this step.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amount of Funding</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill brings the funding rate for Senate elections into line with that for the House of Representatives and increases the election funding rate to $1.50 for each formal first preference vote, indexed each six months to rises in the CPI.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes will provide an estimated additional $14.656 million of public funding for registered political parties and entitled candidates, based on the payments made for the 1993 General Election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Standing Committee noted that it takes as much effort to win a Senate vote as one for the House of Representatives and this illogical distinction will be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increasing emphasis on disclosure has meant that donors are far more reluctant to contribute given that the Australian public will now be aware of their commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government and the Committee takes the view that the increase in funding is reasonable in the circumstances and a fair price to pay for a more transparent political process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Donors' Returns</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Donors to political parties were previously required to furnish returns following each election. This bill amends the reporting requirements of these donors to bring them into line with the reporting requirements of political parties by requiring annual returns to be furnished within 20 weeks after the end of the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Closing Loopholes</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A loophole in the existing legislation which is addressed by this bill relates to the operation of trust funds and similar organisations (including companies) which function wholly or mainly for the benefit of a registered political party or a number of political parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To appreciate the extent to which the disclosure provisions are being flouted one need only examine the latest returns of the Opposition parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal Party for example. has revealed that it has received income of $7.2 million laundered through a trust called the Free Enterprise Foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The donations to this Foundation have not been disclosed to the AEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One does not know if all the income from this trust has gone to the Liberal Party but current yields on funds would suggest that the undisclosed donations could exceed $80 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To evade the disclosure provisions the National Party launders its donations through John McEwen House Pty. Limited, a corporation that provides income to the Nationals amounting to half a million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently we heard of the South Australian Liberal receiving a $100,000 donation through an unregistered Hong Kong company. It has been suggested that the real source of these funds could be parties interested in bidding for a casino licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To my mind the AEC's ability to police overseas donors represents a weakness in the legislation and I propose to give the Joint Standing Committee a reference to advise how these provisions might be strengthened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Closing these loopholes has a lot of similarities to tackling tax evasion schemes. As one gate is shut, smart lawyers invent another. Nevertheless something has to be done to restore the spirit of our disclosure laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that trusts and related entities must provide annual returns to the Electoral Commission containing substantially the same information as parties are required to report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However where an amount was paid to or for the benefit of one or more registered political parties from funds generated by capital of that entity, each person who contributed to the capital must be identified in the return.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following on from this is a provision which makes these entities subject to compliance investigations by officers authorised by the Australian Electoral Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another loophole has been addressed by providing that donations made to a person or body with the intention of benefiting a particular registered political party will be deemed to be donations directly to that party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also addresses a concern expressed by some party agents about compliance investigations of local party units by providing that the registered party agent may attend such investigations or may nominate another person to attend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An anomaly in the Act has been addressed by providing that the current registered agent of a political party may request that amendment be made to a claim or return&mdash;previously, only the person who furnished the claim or return could make a request to the Electoral Commission that the claim or return be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">FIRST CORPORATE LAW SIMPLIFICATION BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill simplifies the provisions in the Corporations Law concerning share buy-backs, proprietary companies and company registers. It is the first step in a comprehensive program for the simplification of the Corporations Law. It demonstrates that the Law can be made more accessible to ordinary people, to give them a grasp of the Law's general principles and an appreciation of their rights and obligations under the Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Simplification Program</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporations Law Simplification Program was established to reduce the complexity of the Corporations Law. Its primary goal is to improve access to the Law and to make it capable of being understood by business and its other user groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Simple laws also promote economic efficiency. The Program aims to reduce the regulatory burden on business by eliminating unnecessary regulation. This will not be achieved at the expense of investor protection. The Program examines regulatory requirements in the Law and assesses whether they are necessary to meet the needs of business, investors and creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is the product of an extensive public consultative process, providing a model for the development of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The day-to-day responsibility for the Program rests with a 4-person Task Force comprising an experienced corporate lawyer, a plain English expert, a senior legislative drafter and a senior policy lawyer from the Attorney-General's Department. Their combined skills greatly benefit the Program, in the preparation of proposals for change, draft legislation and the final product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force works closely with a 14-person private sector Consultative Group. Representing a broad range of users of the Law, the Consultative Group assists in providing the overall direction for the Program and participates in the preparation of draft legislation. The role of the Consultative Group is supplemented by public consultation with the full range of users of the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How the Law is being simplified</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Plain language drafting</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has been written with the principles of plain language firmly in mind. Provisions have been arranged in the order in which readers look for them. A more natural idiom is used. Sentence lengths and a more natural flow of sentences have been consciously chosen to aid reader understanding. Tables of provisions, notes and cross-references have been used to integrate more closely relevant areas of the Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will improve the presentation of the Law and make provisions easier to find. For example:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">headings have been placed at the top of each page</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">individual subsections are given headings</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">margins are wider and pages are made more `open', giving the text a less cluttered feel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill's Explanatory Memorandum is also more useful, allowing the reader to place individual provisions in their proposed context within the Corporations Law, rather than paraphrasing the text of the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role of the courts and the legal profession</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some years now, many judges and other lawyers have rightly been calling for Parliament to pass laws which are comprehensible and accessible for those who use those laws. This bill represents the first attempt to deal comprehensively with that concern in the corporate law area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government hopes the legal profession in general, and the courts in particular, will show support for this initiative by striving to apply the provisions in a straightforward and accessible fashion, and rejecting arguments based on unlikely constructions or excessively fine distinctions. The problem of complex laws is one that must be tackled by all those involved in the legal system. This bill, once enacted, will be a major contribution by the law makers in this Parliament. But those who use and apply the law must also play their part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Easing regulatory burden</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The easing of regulatory burdens is a significant element of the Simplification Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, the share buy-back provisions include rules aimed at insider trading and market manipulation. Other areas of the Law already adequately address these matters. The bill will eliminate this unnecessary duplication.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, the Law currently requires companies to keep several different registers. These registers are costly to maintain adequately (many smaller companies do not) and are rarely inspected by the public. The bill will abolish 5 registers where the requirement to maintain the register is outdated or the information required is more easily obtained from the ASC or the ASX.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Law divides companies into public and proprietary companies, the Law currently makes little provision for the needs of small business. For small business, the bill will put into the Law a guide to the rules concerning proprietary companies. The guide will function as an introduction to the Law for the directors and shareholders of small companies, and will improve their understanding of and access to the Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes the Law more responsive to the needs of small business by:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">making the financial reporting obligations of proprietary companies proportionate to their economic significance</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">allowing proprietary companies to have only one member and one director</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">making annual general meetings optional for proprietary companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consultation and testing</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is the product of extensive consultations with a wide range of regular users of the Law. These consultations commence with the involvement of private sector expertise in both the Task Force and the Consultative Group in the preparation of proposals which are released for public comment. The proposals and any comments received on them form the basis of draft legislation which is in turn exposed for public comment for at least 3 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force meets regularly with representatives of the peak organisations which have a particular interest in the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every aspect of the bill, from policy to drafting to layout, has also been extensively tested with small `focus groups' of users. In addition, public seminars have been held on the bill in most State capitals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has been progressively refined as a result of comments received throughout this process. The result is a bill which is clear to its ordinary reader, and which also achieves the appropriate policy balance between those whose interests are affected by the Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the detail of the three areas covered by the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Share buy-backs</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporations Law currently allows a company to buy back its own shares. However, the existing legislation has been criticised as:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">being too long, complex and difficult to understand (it is more than 10 times longer than the equivalent legislation in comparable jurisdictions)</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Few companies have used the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Winding back unnecessary regulation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A company's ability to buy back its shares should only be subject to safeguards necessary to protect the interests of its creditors and shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing rules establish procedures involving reports by auditors and other experts, advertisements and declarations. These impose costs on companies without conferring any real additional protection for creditors and shareholders. Most overseas jurisdictions do not require this. These rules will be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shareholders and creditors will be sufficiently protected by rules which focus on solvency, fairness between shareholders and disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will protect the interests of shareholders and creditors without imposing excessive compliance costs on business. It will also make the Australian rules concerning share buy-backs closer to those which currently apply in the United States, Canada and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proprietary companies</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to ease the regulatory burden placed by the Law on small business has long been recognised. In an effort to ease this burden, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities recommended in 1992 the creation of a new corporate structure, the `private company'. The Government's response to the Committee's report was tabled in the House of Representatives on 8 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliamentary Committee was clearly right in its conclusion that the laws regulating small business need to be streamlined. Indeed, the Government decided that this bill should simplify the existing regulation of all proprietary companies, achieving the benefits of the private company proposal without adding an additional corporate structure to the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should highlight the importance of the provisions in the bill which will enable sole traders to incorporate without the need to involve a second shareholder or director in the business. This amendment will alleviate a number of problems which have a particular impact on women who are involved in business. Reports over recent years suggest that women are heavily involved in small business and, in fact, are setting up their own businesses at a much faster rate than men.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current requirement for a minimum of two directors and shareholders for a company has presented significant practical difficulties for many women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, businesswomen may find it difficult to find another person willing to act as a director of their companies. They may be unwilling to have their husbands or partners as directors or shareholders out of a desire to retain a degree of independence within the family unit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the minimum number requirement often leads to women becoming directors of companies controlled by their spouse in which they do not play any meaningful role. This can expose these women to the legal liabilities of a company director, without them having any influence over the operation of the company. As recent cases have shown, people acting as directors without being involved in the company's affairs can be responsible for the company's debts upon insolvency. The outcome is similar to the problem which results from `sexually transmitted debt' when a person acts as guarantor for the debts of their spouse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will address these problems, and help women to establish themselves in business on their own terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial reporting by proprietary companies</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the major innovations in the bill deals with the preparation of accounts by proprietary companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill bases financial reporting obligations on criteria relating to the economic significance of a company. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does this by introducing a distinction between small and large proprietary companies. A proprietary company will be `small' if it satisfies at least 2 criteria which relate to the company's turnover, assets and number of employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The criteria are deliberately set at generous levels, in order to enable the vast majority of proprietary companies to take advantage of the reduced annual reporting requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For companies below these thresholds, there will generally be no requirement under the Corporations Law to prepare annual financial statements. However, under the bill, proprietary companies will have to prepare annual financial statements if members holding at least 5 percent of the voting shares so require or if the ASC so directs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The removal of financial reporting requirements from the Corporations Law will enable small companies to focus on their actual accounting needs, rather than being compelled to comply with often superfluous Corporations Law obligations. This proposal has been favourably received by small business interests, which suggests that the potential savings will be worthwhile.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small business guide</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major initiative in the bill is the introduction of the small business guide. The guide is designed for people who operate small businesses and aims to help them understand their rights and responsibilities if they choose to incorporate their businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other changes affecting small business</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also ease a number of other existing regulatory burdens for all proprietary companies. Proprietary companies will be able to pass a resolution if all of the members of the company sign a minute of the resolution, without needing to hold a formal meeting. In addition, these companies will not be required to hold an annual general meeting. This reform will remove from the Law a procedure which is often a mere formality, and may be of little use to the members of a proprietary company. Finally, it will no longer be necessary for proprietary companies to restrict the transfer of their shares. Of course, some companies may prefer to restrict the transfer of their shares, and they will be free to continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Company registers</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporations Law currently requires companies to keep a number of registers so the public can have access to certain information about the company and its officers. The regular updating of these registers can be a significant administrative burden, and often the registers are little used.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the information in company registers must also be given to the ASC. In practice, it is quite simple for members of the public to access this information through the ASC's electronic searching facilities, and through the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in the case of listed companies, rather than by going to the company's offices and searching registers kept by it. Where this is possible, the separate maintenance of registers by companies is an unnecessary duplication.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the Corporations Law to remove the requirements that companies keep registers of directors, principal executive officers and secretaries, directors' shareholdings and buy-backs, and that listed companies keep registers of substantial shareholders and notices of beneficial interests. In the case of directors' shareholdings, the outdated requirement that all companies keep a register of this information will be replaced by rules requiring directors of listed companies to disclose the information to the ASX. This will ensure that investors in those companies have rapid and easy access to information about directors' shareholdings, while at the same time lifting an unnecessary paperwork burden from the vast majority of companies whose shares are not actively traded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Registers of members, option holders and debenture holders</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Companies will still have to keep registers relating to their members and debenture holders. Further, the register of options will become a register of option holders, to provide more relevant and up to date information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to concerns about the use of information from registers to invade the privacy of securities holders, such as through the compilation of mailing lists to send correspondence to them, the bill introduces a new provision which prohibits the misuse of information on these registers. Substantial sanctions, including criminal penalties and an account of profits, will become available in this area for the first time. This will represent a significant and practical safeguard for the privacy of those listed in these registers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Directors' residential addresses</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some company directors have expressed concern that the publication of their residential address on the ASC's database may put their personal safety in danger.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporations Law should not put the physical safety of company officers at risk. The bill will therefore amend the Law to enable the residential addresses of directors and secretaries to be suppressed from the database.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Electoral Act contains provisions which enable voters to have their addresses removed from the electoral roll where the public availability of this information would put their personal safety at risk. The bill will introduce a similar scheme for company directors and secreta ries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the bill will require an alternative address to be publicly available, to enable legal service to be effected. Company officers will also have to supply their residential addresses to the ASC, so that the ASC will be able to locate them if necessary and they are contactable in a situation where a judgment debt needs to be enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliamentary Joint Committee</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it was before the House of Representatives, the bill was considered by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. Overall, the Committee commented favourably on the bill and on the consultation process used in its development. The Committee recommended one amendment to the bill concerning the provision on debenture registers and this change was taken up in Government amendments to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second Corporate Law Simplification Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The goal of the Simplification Program is a Law that works; a Law that is more understandable and accessible; and a Law that is easier for companies to comply with, but that sufficiently protects shareholders, creditors and the wider public from possible abuses of the corporate form. The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill is the first of a number of bills which will further this goal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Simplification Task Force has already commenced work on the Second Corporate Law Simplification Bill. That bill will address the topics of forming a company, deregistration of companies, share capital, annual returns, accounts and audit, and company names and meetings. When this second bill has been passed, small companies will be able to operate almost entirely under a simplified Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MINCO approval</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I confirm that the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted and, to the extent necessary, has approved the bill for introduction into Parliament in accordance with the Heads of Agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe we adjourned the debate on this matter just after I had moved an amendment to the motion Senator Faulkner had proposed. I will try not to belabour this and go over history. For years there have been problems about the way in which legislation comes to this place from the House of Representatives&mdash;it all tends to come at once, without sufficient time for scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion moved by Senator Faulkner allowed the problem of scrutiny to be dealt with. It indicated that, if a bill had been introduced in the House of Representatives in the last session, we would be free to debate it here at the next session; if not, it would be adjourned automatically to the first day of the next sitting. I believe that allows for community consultation and some kind of preparation time for senators in relation to the legislation. The reason it allows for that is that the House of Representatives does not amend much or give much scrutiny to legislation and it just passes through on an automatic basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If in debates significant amendments were made, I would not be able to agree with this motion. We should request that the consideration of a bill be completed in the House of Representatives in the session prior to its being introduced in the Senate. That would allow us to give scrutiny to the completed bill. Because there is no appreciable difference between the introduced bill and the completed bill as it currently comes from the House of Representatives, the stipulation that it be introduced in the other place should be sufficient to warrant community consultation and scrutiny time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the motion does not deal with the problem of log jams which occur because the House of Representatives has fallen into the very undesirable practice of pushing through large numbers of bills in the very last days of its sittings. This means that an even greater number of bills that have not been adequately considered could be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate is in danger of being inundated with significant bills that require considerable debate and amendment. We will ourselves suffer from a log jam at the end of our sittings. I might add that we seem to be doing it in any case. The procedural motion which I proposed over a year ago would have addressed that. However, that motion has not been accepted and we now have this slightly different measure that has been introduced by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My amendment seeks to deal with that log jam problem by saying that the Senate does not have to be inundated with bills just because the House or Representatives has a log jam of legislation in its last week or day of sittings. My amendment seeks to insert after paragraph (b) of Senator Faulkner's motion the following word and paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"; or (c) is received from the House or Representatives after the expiration of two-thirds of the total number of days of sitting of the Senate scheduled for that period of sittings"</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Faulkner's motion then continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and a motion is moved for the second reading of the bill, debate on that motion shall be adjourned at the conclusion of the speech of the Senator moving the motion and resumption of the debate shall be made an order of the day for the first day of sitting in the next period of sittings without any question being put.</PARA>
<PARA>The wording of the amendment may seem a bit clumsy. However, the amendment seeks to ensure that debate on bills that are not received from the House of Representatives by two-thirds of the way through the estimated time of our sittings will automatically be adjourned to the first day of the next sittings. Any exemption to that will have to be sought by the agreement of the chamber. That is all I intend to say about this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very tempted to withdraw the amendment because it was rather clumsy and to seek the opposition's support in opposing the motion. I believe that the principle we have in place of a bill introduced and passed in the House of Representatives in one session being considered in the Senate the next session is far more preferable than what we have now before us. However, because I understand that the opposition is not prepared to vote against the new motion and support that principle, I ask opposition senators and any other senators to support my amendment. I believe that the amendment addresses a twofold problem&mdash;allowing the opportunity for community scrutiny and trying to redress and limit the operation of the log jam effect in the Senate. Having moved my amendment, I seek the support of my colleagues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We interpreted the principal motion as meaning that the Senate would be given adequate notice of the government's intention to bring legislation to the Senate. We accepted that the changes the government was seeking to make were not unreasonable. They would have meant that a bill would have had to have been introduced into either the House of Representatives or the Senate in the sittings previous to that in which it is debated in the Senate. We accepted that as giving the Senate reasonable notice of the government's intention, and thus allowing senators to prepare themselves for the subsequent debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I said at that time, however, that I recognised that the motion that we were debating did not overcome the habit of this government of stacking legislation at the end of a sittings and thus inhibiting proper debate. I said that was a major problem that we had been seeking to address over a long period of time. It could be simply resolved by the government better ordering its own program and ensuring the more effectual functioning of the parliament. But the government has not acted in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, over the years we have attempted to put in place a number of different mechanisms to try to discipline the government to bring before the parliament an orderly program. Those attempts have failed. This is yet another attempt&mdash;in this instance by Senator Chamarette. It is a fairly modest attempt but, nevertheless, an attempt. As I interpret her amendment, the government has got to bring matters to the Senate no later than two-thirds of the way through a sittings. That will not entirely solve the problem because, without goodwill, the government can still stack&mdash;it can bring in bills before the two-thirds cut-off date and then not proceed to finalisation until the last sitting week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can see from the look on your face, Madam Acting Deputy President West, that you do not believe the government would act in bad faith. I do not share your confidence in this government. Its record in relation to the management of the Senate's legislation program has been deplorable. That is something that could be so easily overcome with just a little bit of competent management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner reminds me that he has been so distracted, trying to get himself out of the awful mess he is in with administration of the environment portfolio in this session, that there has been no management of the government's program at all. That is part of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I concede that Senator Chamarette's attempt is a useful one. I urge the government to respond to it positively rather than in its usual negative way. If we implement this amendment&mdash;if the government accepts it as a positive contribution and acts accordingly&mdash;the Senate would be better able to function and that would be in the interests of the Australian parliamentary process. Therefore, the coalition will support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have long been concerned to get orderly business in the Senate. I was working as a staffer in 1978 when Malcolm Fraser's government had control of both houses of the parliament. I well remember that we used to get bills about an hour before we had to debate them. Senator Hill may not remember that but I remember it well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember extremely well having to go around to a minister's office, holding out my hand and saying, `Excuse me, can I have a copy of the bill?' It was very difficult. When a bill was introduced in the Senate we had a lot of trouble getting hold of it, in some cases before it was passed. It probably was not quite that bad, but it was pretty bad. From that moment on, the Democrats, who had a great deal of trouble getting hold of legislation then&mdash;Senator Harradine, who has been here a lot longer than I have, would remember the situation&mdash;have been concerned with making sure that we have the bills a long time in advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that Senator Faulkner's motion, with Senator Chamarette's proposed amendment, will solve the problem of scrutiny because bills will come up a long time before debate. I must admit that I came into this chamber thinking that was all we needed but I have not checked the figures on log jams coming from the House of Representatives. The Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) does not like being regularly gratuitously and offensively abused by anyone from the opposition&mdash;none of us do&mdash;and tries to avoid it. However, although he understands the way this works, he is not assisted particularly well by his colleagues in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I do not have the figures but I suspect there may be a bit of a log jam at the end and it might be sensible to move it. Still, I would like to see how this works over time, because if it is not essential we may not need to keep it. Certainly, the first part of the motion, as moved by Senator Faulkner, is very useful, fixing a problem that we have had for quite a while.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved by Senator Chamarette, but I do so reluctantly in that it is a fall-back position. I think it has been very generous of Senator Chamarette to even contemplate moving that particular amendment. We have to remember the genesis of the cut-off motion, which was the clear undertaking by the government, through the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, that so far as is possible the government would abide by the principle of introducing legislation one session and debating it the next. That was the genesis of the motion that was eventually moved by Senator Chamarette and adopted by the Senate in November last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We thought this would be part of the accountability package that was being discussed at the time of the sports rorts affair. Be that as it may, I understand that there are difficulties. In his calm and reasonable way, Senator Faulkner has indicated them to the chamber. We have had to give them consideration. However, as Senator Hill has mentioned, there are two problems. One problem is that of adequate time for members of parliament and the public to consider the ramifications of bills that are introduced into the parliament. The second problem is that of log jams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This compromised solution in the form of the amendment moved by Senator Chamarette addresses the latter problem. She is proposing her amendment to go some of the way towards addressing the former problem; that is, the problem of giving adequate time to senators and to the public to consider the ramifications of legislation. Under those circumstances, I am reluctantly prepared to go along with the amendment. I hope that the government can see that this amendment is put forward in good faith and in an attempt to address both of those problems, which we all agree should be addressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will not be supporting Senator Chamarette's amendment, which she has claimed is aimed at avoiding the log jam in the Senate in the last week of sittings. These so-called log jams&mdash;I would not argue with that name; it is as good a name as you could give&mdash;generally arise because of the low rate of legislative activity in the first weeks of the sittings and because such a large number of bills are referred to committees. That causes delays in reporting dates, and the program consequently becomes back loaded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solution is not Senator Chamarette's amendment, even though it is possible that she has moved it in good faith. That is not the solution. The solution is to ensure that senators spend time examining legislation over the break between sittings and that, where referrals are necessary, they are done before the end of the sittings. That is the real solution. Otherwise, at the end of the day, no useful purpose is served by introducing legislation in the sittings before it is due to be debated. </PARA>

I agree entirely with him that the real solution lies in a different direction. We should deal with the business of the Senate in an orderly manner week by week. He did admit that we do have a log jam; and he did admit that that log jam comes at the end of the sittings. All this motion does is to put off that log jam, or to give us seven extra sitting days in which to give consideration to the log jam. It does not actually deal with the log jam&mdash;it will still come. It will simply come seven days before the end of the sittings instead of at the end of the sittings.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill is one of the central planks of the announcement made by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) on 30 December last year of measures to prevent abuse of our asylum laws and procedures. At the time these announcements were made, the minister indicated that the government intended to enact these measures as soon as possible. This was the minister's intention to ensure that our refugee determination process continues to be able to operate and to deal expeditiously and fairly with genuine claims for asylum and that it is not prevented from doing so by the clogging of the system by unfounded claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is part of a package of bills introduced in the first week of the current session. The first bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), has already been passed by the parliament following the Senate's agreement to waive the arrangements which call for introduction in the session prior to that in which the bills are debated and passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This explanation was prepared by way of the amendment, so I suppose we could say that it may have been near enough to legitimate. The point is that the Senate has already given permission to waive its own rule for the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). What Minister Bolkus would like to see is that same exemption extended to this piece of legislation because it is essentially part of a package: not one bill stands by itself. This bill needs to be included with the others that have gone with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate agreed on that occasion with the government's contention&mdash;that is, for the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2)&mdash;that the bill was of such importance and urgency that the motion we today seek to set aside should not prevent the urgent passage of that bill. Would the Senate, having considered that way once before, consider that way once again, particularly as it is part of the same package of legislation? The government does appreciate that on occasions the Senate recognises bills will need to be legislated urgently, and this is one such occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government takes its obligations under the refugee convention very seriously, as it does with all relevant international legal obligations. It is the government's desire to ensure that our determination process embodies our total commitment to these obligations. Equally, it is also true that the government's desire is to ensure that our process is not abused&mdash;that it is a fair, just and quick process, but not one that is open to abuse such as that which has been evidenced by the tendency for continuous, repeated applications that some so-called asylum seekers make in order to prolong their stay in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our determination process must also fully and fairly apply our protection obligations under the refugee convention. Australia played a prominent role in the drafting of the refugee convention and that convention restricts its protection obligations to those falling within its definition of a refugee. That definition is not as wide as some people might like, and that is why some of those people have opposed this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to preserve the integrity of the refugee convention definition of a refugee by ensuring that it is not interpreted in such a way as to deprive it of any meaning. The bill reaffirms our commitment to providing protection to anyone who has a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of race, nationality, religion, political opinion or membership of a particular social group. This could include people who fear forceful sterilisation or abortion by a government because they fit into one of the above convention grounds.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the point that Senator Harradine makes does balance this. It is a matter of urgency. But, to make it clear for anybody listening or any senator who is not completely across all this, this is a matter of urgency particularly in relation to the two points that I have just gone through to highlight the main substance of the bill. The reason those points are urgent is that the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) is being considered by the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. This bill is in substantially the same terms as that bill, but it incorporates some amendments which clarify, in light of some of the contributions made to the committee, the intended operation of the bill. So we do have the opportunity here to take account of the Senate's further input through that legal and constitutional committee. </PARA>

On behalf of the government I would have to say, especially to Senator Hill, that the government welcomes this and the opposition's recognition of the urgent need to pass this bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are doing with this piece of legislation is what we do with all pieces of legislation: come to the most appropriate balance that we can find between protecting rights of world citizens and at the same time maintaining the integrity of a system that, on the one hand, protects and allows proper and correct refugees into the country and, on the other hand, tries to close down the options so that people do not abuse the refugee system to get into this country.

The Sackville decision needs to be addressed as soon as possible. Senator Hill and the opposition have called for steps to be taken to prevent abuse. They have indicated their support. They have even foreshadowed, possibly, amendments. I think the word `possibly' is a very telling one in the course of this debate. It is a matter of importance to the government to make quite clear its intentions in this matter and not to allow the possibility and the confusion in the community as well as the prospects of abuse under this system. So I think there is a very good case to be made for why this piece of legislation should be brought on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear, Senator Crowley, because I think you may have misrepresented the coalition's position a little, that we support the intent of the legislation. We have also made it clear, however, that we believe certain amendments are necessary. We have foreshadowed that. In public statements by me on behalf of the coalition I have expressed the type of amendment we believe has to be considered by this parliament. I have to say that that has met with a deafening silence from the government. Certainly no-one from the government has come to me as a result of my statements of a couple of weeks ago and said, `Let's get together and see what you are actually proposing.' I would have thought that, if you thought this was as urgent as you say it is, then the government would at least have had the wit to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not want to hold the legislation up. It is correct that we said at the end of last year that the government was very tardy in taking the actions that we believe are necessary to give a clear signal, particularly to potential boat people from southern China, that it was just not on to get on a boat and come to Australia. So our credentials are absolutely clear and clean on that. Indeed, it was the government that was belated in taking any action at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, we have said that we want to make sure the legislation is fair and just and does not put Australia in a situation where we are ignoring some quite fundamental and basic human rights concerns, including such issues, particularly in this instance, as forced or coerced sterilisation or abortions.

We will move those amendments, but we would like the government to consider the issue and to indicate whether it is prepared to agree to the basic principle that we are putting forward; that is that, while we agree that the repressive fertility policies of the PRC should not, of themselves, mean that Australia should give blanket acceptance as a refugee to every former citizen of the PRC who turns up in Australia as an asylum seeker, we, nevertheless, want to ensure that whatever persecution citizens of the PRC experience as a result of those repressive policies is taken into account when the refugee status of individual asylum seekers is assessed.</PARA></TALK.START>

At this stage we have had no reaction from the government following the report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee which contains the amendments that I have suggested.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That goes to the point that was made by Senator Crowley. She says that there is a problem, that non-genuine refugees are being dealt with. The government makes the judgment. Why not leave it to the independent Refugee Review Tribunal, which in this case found that the couple were genuine refugees and that their human rights would be grossly violated if they were forced back to China?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Convention on the Status of Refugees, it is just not sufficient for people to establish a well-founded fear, both subjectively and objectively, that they would face persecution. It is not enough to prove that. A person must not only have a firmly established and well-founded fear of persecution if returned, but also establish that the persecution is because of the person's race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case I am referring to, the judge said that the persecution was not for any of the first four reasons but was because the couple were part of a social group&mdash;that is, parents with one child identified and targeted by China's fertility control policy. Do honourable senators follow?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is making it impossible for some refugees to jump that second hurdle. They will already have had to establish a well-founded fear. They are facing virtually certain forced sterilisation or forced abortion but, unless they can jump that second hurdle&mdash;that is to say, unless the persecution is because of one of the convention-related reasons&mdash;they will not be regarded as refugees in accordance with the convention and they will be subjected to return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill says that, in determining whether a person is a member of a particular social group, the persons determining that, including the courts, shall disregard the fertility control policies of the PRC. So their case falls to the ground unless, as the minister said, they can prove it under some other convention ground&mdash;that is to say, race, religion, political opinion or nationality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coercive population control policies, the fertility control policies, of the PRC are widespread. They are not directed at people because of their race or their religion. The judge found it was not directed at those other four categories, but that it was directed at people because they were identified and targeted by the fertility control policies of the PRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has indicated that one part of the bill, repeat applications, was of concern. From memory, I think Senator Spindler dealt with that matter in his dissenting report. I have certain other suggestions to make as well in that regard. I am quite happy to discuss with the minister, the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens my interest in that matter. I think it can be logically gone through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other matter the government has said some very strange things. In the House of Representatives Mrs Crosio on behalf of the minister said something which, on the face of it, gives some hope that the government is prepared to ensure that persons who have established a well-founded fear of coerced abortion, coerced sterilisation or other grave sanction will not be forced back to their persecutors. But, because this legislation is substantially the same and has the same intention as the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), we have to listen to the people who know the legal advice that has been given to us&mdash;not only the legal advice but also advice from persons we should listen to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has been roundly condemned. The representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has publicly branded this bill as `unusual, unfortunate and without precedent'. In an interview with AAP on 9 March he said further things which I suggest honourable senators should have a look at. If you read between the lines, you will see what the UNHCR is saying about this particular matter. I do not think you have to go to the letter that the representative wrote to the department to see that; you can see it in the public statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has been roundly condemned by a former High Court judge and President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson; Amnesty International; the Law Council of Australia; the Australian Law Reform Commission; the Catholic Bishops of Australia; the Bar Association of New South Wales; prominent feminists and researchers, Dr Renate Klein and Dr Lynette Dumble; the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia; and the Refugee Council of Australia. Are we listening to these people? What they are saying is encapsulated in what Sir Ronald Wilson said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason I am concerned that the government is trying to push ahead with this is that coerced sterilisation or abortion is a flagrant disregard of a fundamental human right. Sir Ronald said, `In my submission, it is wrong for the government to ask the parliament and the people of this country to condone the exclusion of asylum seekers from refugee status based on a well-founded fear of that kind of persecution.' Sir Ronald is saying it is wrong&mdash;I also believe it is wrong&mdash;for the government to ask the parliament and the people to pass legislation which will deny asylum seekers refugee status based on a well-founded fear of coerced abortion, coerced sterilisation or other grave sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should this bill be adopted and result in the forcing back of persons who have a well-founded fear of coerced abortion, coerced sterilisation or other grave sanctions into the hands of their tormentors, into the hands of their persecutors, I would feel ashamed to remain a member of this federal parliament of Australia with a government which would then be an accessory to that gross violation of human rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was mid-speech when progress on this matter was reported yesterday, commenting on two concerns&mdash;one held by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) and one by Senator Kernot&mdash;about the reasons for the amendment that the Greens have proposed. The proposed amendment would add a clause to the bill relating to public interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister felt that, instead of inserting that reference into this bill, we should insert it into each of the pieces of legislation that relate to it. That is a very fragmented way of doing things, especially when we are considering umbrella legislation and in view of the outline provided by the government to explain the purpose of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That outline says that, broadly, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill will provide a single set of core reporting and auditing requirements for directors of Commonwealth authorities and set out standards of conduct for executive officers. In other words, it is an attempt to deal in some coherent way with all those provisions. That is why it is perfectly appropriate to add a clause that goes to the public interest motivation that these authorities and companies should have. It is much better to put it in this legislation rather than in any separate legislation that might be enacted in relation to these particular authorities and companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot basically said that such companies would always act in the public interest. She felt that did not need to be stated; that if it were stated, it would in some way disadvantage those particular companies. I cannot agree with that. I believe that these particular organisations, because they originate from statutes passed by this parliament, have a very privileged position in relation to obligations under federal, state and local government laws and by-laws. They actually have an advantage over private companies. With that privilege should go the added responsibility of being seen to act and acting in the public interest. That should be required by the legislation to ensure that the public has some recourse should they feel these organisations are failing in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third comment I wish to make is a more general one and it also relates to a comment by the minister. He felt that, because this primarily is to deal with financial management, accountability and audit of Commonwealth agencies, authorities and companies, the whole area of public interest and social responsibility is out of place. I disagree very strongly on that point. I believe financial integrity is not the only integrity that should be of concern to us. I believe this parliament holds a much wider brief than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this outline adds, the bill is to provide a single set of requirements for ensuring that wholly owned Commonwealth companies keep ministers and the parliament informed of their activities. Whether the ministers only want to know about financial and auditing requirements is a different question. I would not presume to give that position, but I know that the parliament wants to be informed on a far wider basis than simply an economic basis. We want to see the public interest activities and accountability of these companies demonstrated for the benefit of the people of this country. That is why we believe this amendment actually enhances this bill and should be included within it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, unless there are any further comments, I urge my committee colleagues to support amendment No. 1, which places an obligation on Commonwealth authorities and executive officers and wholly owned Commonwealth companies and directors to act in the public interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not support the amendments either. In saying that, though, I want to say with all the force and power I can bring that the sentiments in the amendments are not something with which we disagree. The reason we do not support the amendments as such is that this is not the place to do it. It is already done, and done effectively, throughout this bill and elsewhere in other legislation. I guess that will invite the rejoinder, `Why can't we do it again?' But if we keep cluttering up Commonwealth legislation with noble sentiments peppered throughout, we will actually distort the legislative base, misdirect attention from what the real purpose of that legislation is and confuse people as to its meaning. It is better to keep things simple and clear and to set out the requirements in the appropriate place rather than simply to centralise the requirements for all government authorities in one simple bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

They expect to find set out therein what the obligations are, what the principles might be and the privileges that organisation might have. That is where they expect to find it; that is where it should be; that is where it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a bill that springs from a review which commenced over a year ago in order to reform the Audit Act. It is a bill which has widespread support in this chamber. It was introduced in the House of Representatives in June of last year and underwent scrutiny by the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts between June and September&mdash;a quite extended period of time. It has been subject to a report by that committee and has been through the scrutiny of a Senate hearing. There is a widespread view as to how we should proceed in a technical way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say, with the greatest of respect, to the proposers of the motion and the supporters of it that, for them to come through at the last minute after all of that process, and not having participated in it, and put up an amendment&mdash;no matter how nobly motivated it might be; and I do not deny the noble motivation&mdash;and then to not accept advice as to what the best way of implementing it might be is to ignore the whole process of rational debate and discussion and the formation of legislation and to ignore the obvious fact, which stands like a pikestaff before our eyes, that in the legislation for the particular government authorities lie the requirements, in code, of public good, public decency and public office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the general sentiments of this amendment are okay; I do not in any way resile from that. But the authorities are already expected to operate and act in the public interest. The authorities under this bill must be established for a public purpose. The statutory objectives and responsibilities that they have are designed to achieve that purpose. When we debate bills relating to them, we decide what that purpose is and how we can best achieve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authorities under this bill require executive officers to exercise proper `care and diligence' to ensure that public purpose objectives are met and that the responsibilities that they have are carried out. Many of the organisations' provisions deal with accountability of executive officers. This is the main purpose of the bill. The proposed reference in the amendment to safety is not appropriate for financial legislation in this package. It should be in enabling acts or other legislation. In other words, this is an extension of the Audit Act and the requirements of the Audit Act. To extend the canvas more broadly, you ought to look to the bill&mdash;not to the Audit Act&mdash;to see what the other obligations might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed requirements in this amendment for ethical conduct of executive officers is not necessary. The authorities already require executive officers to act honestly, which is the legal term. They preclude improper use of inside information and they preclude involvement in matters where directors have a `material personal interest'. That does cover the widest possible scope of responsibility in public office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed reference to efficiency and effectiveness is not essential here either. The necessary incentive will be provided by enhanced accountability requirements leading to more effective scrutiny of performance. Accountability requirements include regular reports to ministers, new annual reporting requirements and interim half-yearly or quarterly reports to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed emphasis in this amendment on public interest would be difficult to administer in practice because it is subjective. This point of view was just made by the opposition. What is the public interest is a subjective judgment that each of us makes. For example, if the ABC showed a program which contained some violence, would it breach the public interest obligation? All of us will have a different view about that. To drag the ABC back and argue our personal subjective public interest view about that type of thing means that we would be interfering in the running of these organisations in a way that can be capricious and not go to the good running of those organisations. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that we do not subject Commonwealth authorities to capricious subjective judgments; rather, there is a broad understanding of public interest which is best able to be raised in the holistic context of those reports when they come down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If government business enterprises maximise benefits to the public, they would need to forgo profits and not provide a return to the Commonwealth. This is a very important point. The obvious reason why government business enterprises operate is to provide benefits to the public. They do it in two ways&mdash;by providing the services that they provide as a public service and by providing an income that they earn by providing that service to the tax office which can be redistributed as revenue on the outgoing side of the budget; that is, in programs administered by the Commonwealth. To simply take a one dimensional view rather than a two dimensional view of their role is unnecessarily inhibiting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to proposed clause 42AA concerning Commonwealth companies. Obligations to act in the public interest and maximise benefits to the public conflict with the Corporations Law. Under the Corporations Law, directors must act in the best interests of the company; that is, its shareholders. They must act legally. The Commonwealth is the shareholder in the case of government business enterprises. We must ensure that the standards of ethics and accountability of company executive officers are dealt with in the Corporations Law. We ensure those standards in our own law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, proposed clause 46A could be troublesome in practice. Persons with sufficient means could obtain injunctions, causing disruption and impeding efficient and effective operations. The vagueness of the meaning `public interest' would create considerable uncertainty, be a province for endless litigation and turn us into a litigious society. The authority may have a different view of public interest from the government, creating an impossible situation for executive officers in the practical administration of their authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that I understand the sentiments. They are picked up elsewhere and in the appropriate place. The long scrutiny at committee level under both houses of this parliament has acknowledged that over the period. It is wrong now to come in at the last minute and try to change that. The sentiments are appropriately picked up elsewhere, and I have comprehensively answered those points. I ask that the amendment not succeed. </PARA>

I would like to say that, as this is a package of accountability bills that replaces, in a sense, the Audit Act 1901 with modern legislation, it distorts this bill not to include some kind of clause about the fact that an audit responsibility includes looking at the public interest and not simply restricting it to financial accountability. Exclusion of this amendment distorts it if the general intention is there that accountability should involve public interest accountability as well as financial accountability. Unfortunately, if it is excluded because it adds to that, it does not distort but it is a grave problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens were appalled to discover that when there was a package of this kind being introduced there was no mention of Commonwealth-owned instrumentalities being obliged to operate in the public interest. That is a very valid and important statement. It is not just to be assumed. I believe that the minister, later in his comments, revealed two major problems to the introduction of this concept. The first problem is that it does allow people who have been affected by the actions of Commonwealth instrumentalities to take out injunctions restraining them from engaging in those activities if they have a case&mdash;and that means a reasonable case&mdash;that those companies are not acting in the public interest. I believe that is a very valid reason for including them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem is that this concept conflicts with the Corporations Act and the need for these particular companies to be accountable to their shareholders. I believe that, because of the accountability to parliament and the responsibility being given under this legislation, there should be an accountability to the public as well. It is not simply good enough to say that the accountability in the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill is the equivalent of that which is available to private companies. It has to be a greater responsibility because much greater privileges are given. We need to have scrutiny of that aspect. </PARA>

They have obligations that are related to the public interest. They usually have obligations that relate to policy areas that are of importance in the area in which they operate.

When we have built into a publicly funded body shareholders who at an annual general meeting have the ability to vote out their board and to ask questions about the way their funds are being managed, they have the ability to question whether or not their interests are being met. When the owners of those enterprises, however semantically you may argue it&mdash;that is, the people of Australia, the people we represent&mdash;do not have that access because those enterprises are answerable only to a minister, and even that is sometimes questionable, who can choose whether he passes on information to us, the elected parliamentarians of this place, you have a real problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to reply, but I have been asked some questions so I will keep my reply brief but to the point. It simply comes down to the following points. Firstly, the enterprise is set up under an act of this parliament. That act comes through this chamber. The reason for setting it up is to give expression to the public interest. This chamber and the other chamber jointly vote and decide on that. That then becomes the public interest purpose of that enterprise.</PARA></TALK.START>

It may be that you disagree with the view of parliament in some cases. It might be that so do I, but the will of the parliament is the highest expression of the will of the people in this democracy and that is how it should be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The point is that I still have not been advised by Senator Collins of the outcome of the letter. What is very clear is that Mr Corrigan, who was under some substantial degree of suspicion, otherwise there would not have been six charges preferred against him under the Public Service Act, has left a job in Australia, which I understand was an SES band 1 post&mdash;I am happy to be corrected if it was not&mdash;and which attracted a salary of between $60,000 and $69,000 a year and, whilst he is under suspicion, he gets a reference from the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service which enables him to take up a post in the United Kingdom that pays him $40,000 a year more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leave application for his extended leave of absence was signed by the secretary to the department after undertakings had been given by the previous minister responsible for this matter that it would be investigated thoroughly and that there would be a new broom of accountability go through AQIS. If this is the standard of accountability that ministers require, then all the fine words and all the legislation that the government may wish to bring before this Senate is for naught if this is allowed to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the saga becomes worse. Not only has Mr Corrigan managed to duck out of the country with a reference written by AQIS and get an extra $40,000 a year in salary, but in addition to that Mr Corrigan is now at the centre of a scandal in the United Kingdom. His appointment may well hold up the implementation of a new meat inspection service in the United Kingdom. From information available to me, a number of members of parliament have sought to delay the implementation of the meat hygiene service over there, inter alia on the grounds of Mr Corrigan's appointment and the references that were provided to him by the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is more now than simply a matter of the government having an obligation to account to this parliament through the estimates committee as to the disciplinary charges against Mr Corrigan&mdash;my concerns that were expressed in my letter to Senator Collins on 17 March remain. Because of the international scope of this matter, it is now also incumbent upon the government to provide answers in relation to Mr Corrigan so as to avoid further damage to the operations of the United Kingdom's Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that the government should now urgently advise: what was Mr Corrigan's previous rank within the Senior Executive Service&mdash;was he an SES band 1 officer or SES band 2 officer? And what references were provided? Copies of those references should also be provided. An answer given last week in the House of Commons to a question on notice indicated that Mr Corrigan came with a reference from the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service. It does not sound like the government is taking the issue of financial accountability terribly seriously when it writes references for officers so as to get them high-paying jobs overseas whilst they are still under investigation on charges in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What were the six charges? What were the outcomes of the six charges? The minister has to recognise that it is a matter of the utmost urgency to answer these questions, that his delay is contributing to concern about the operation of the meat hygiene service in the United Kingdom and that further delay may prevent the United Kingdom government from implementing that service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just a matter of accountability to the parliament; it is a matter of common decency, given that the United Kingdom government is suffering the consequences of Mr Corrigan's appointment. The government does have an obligation to account. I believe that this is a threshold test of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fine to have all the legislation, it is fine to have all the words, but, at the end of the day, it is the government's willingness to see that accountability occurs which is the most important factor. I urge the government again to address these problems. Today is the last sitting day of this week. I certainly would welcome a statement by the minister after question time, if he wishes to respond to these things. If he does not do so, I would certainly be wondering why, given the level of concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think what we have heard from Senator O'Chee is exactly the proof of what Senator Chamarette was talking about in relation to public interest. There are very good reasons why particular authorities are public authorities. Often it is because the service they provide is something more than the matter of dollars and cents. There are values involved and there are services which require that people not only make a profit but also act in the public interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that operations in relation to such things as quarantine may have devastating effects on both industry and perhaps even our wildlife species in Australia. There is no dollar figure that can be placed on that. If there is a disaster within a private company, you could take people to court and sue them. Maybe you can do that with a government department. However, the private damage to the individual is more difficult to pull out and isolate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that when you are dealing with a public entity which possibly has responsibility for the existence of an entire industry&mdash;whether it is a rural industry or a whole set of species which might be wiped out by incorrect application of such things as important quarantine rules&mdash;you have to take into account the public interest. Might I say that our ability to deal with these kinds of things becomes more difficult in relation to the new rules of lowest common denominator under Codex Alimentaire of GATT. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the greatest respect to the two previous speakers&mdash;Senator O'Chee and Senator Margetts&mdash;no `proof' has been adduced here, nor should it have been.

If there are five or seven charges of misconduct preferred against an officer of the Commonwealth, that is not a matter for this Senate chamber to determine. It is a matter for the Senate chamber to uphold the principle of justice: people are innocent until proven guilty and the matter goes to a court of law to be properly dealt with. I am not suggesting that Senator O'Chee is arguing otherwise; I am simply clarifying that no proof has been adduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating framework legislation for the Auditor-General in conducting audits of government authorities. The branch of government that has been referred to, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, AQIS, does not come under this bill; it is not a Commonwealth authority or a Commonwealth company. AQIS is a branch of the Department of Primary Industry and Energy so, whatever the amendments to this bill, it does not deal with this specific case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as often happens&mdash;I do not complain about it&mdash;when we are debating broad issues of legislative principle, specific cases of concern are raised. They are not always to the point of the legislation but the debate provides an opportunity for honourable senators to make points about issues of concern to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator O'Chee has been pursuing this line of investigation. I have a distant memory of it from an occasion when I represented the Department of Primary Industries and Energy before a Senate estimates committee at which he directly questioned the officer, Mr Corrigan. I understand the political use that these phrases are put to but I object when Senator O'Chee says that the government issued Mr Corrigan with a reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would not be appropriate for me to go to the details of a particular case at law, and I do not intend to do so. However, to the ear of a common listener the statement that the government issued Mr Corrigan with a reference may lead to the assumption that the ministerial representative of the government in that instance&mdash;the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins&mdash;wrote a reference. I do not understand that to be the case but someone in the department who had knowledge of Mr Corrigan as an officer wrote an evaluation of that officer in the form of a reference. That reference was later used by that officer in finding another job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, that is not something that any government can necessarily have control over. We are not always in a position to decide who writes references for whom within the bureaucracy, nor to evaluate the accuracy of those references. It may well be that the reference referred to&mdash;I have not seen it&mdash;was entirely accurate. Usually, with applications for high positions, people check references and contact the originating officer. But, in a way, that is going to the details of a specific case, and I do not intend to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the observation, though, that the broad brush word of government does not mean that we have made a political decision to endorse a particular officer; rather, that someone in the bureaucracy has written a reference for a particular officer. That can be characterised as government, but I think it needs to be differentiated here. Whatever the rights and wrongs of this particular case, the bill before the chamber would not address it. It may well be that Senator Collins has his monitor on in his office and has heard the comments of Senator O'Chee. Perhaps he will be in a position to say something after question time. I do not know. I am sure that the issue will be pursued by Senator O'Chee, and I will certainly bring it to the attention of Senator Collins. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand from representatives of the Grains Industry that you would like my view in response to comments of the Department of Finance concerning amendments to the CAC Bill which were enclosed with my letter of 23 February 1995 by way of submission to The Senate Finance and Public Legislation Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note the comments which you made in the hearings of the Committee and the exchange you had with Mr Carter from the Department of Finance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nature of the various drafting amendments I proposed was to bring the provisions of the CAC Bill into line with the similar provisions of the Corporations Law relating to reporting requirements of Directors. This seemed sensible, if for no other reason, it was in line with the Government's declared intention in relation to the Bill, to have similar duties imposed on Directors of Commonwealth Authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now understand that the Government does not intend to accept many of my proposed amendments and that you have been informed they are regarded as only subsidiary matters and that their incorporation would not make any difference to the interpretation of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I disagree with the Government's opinion. The provisions of the Bill in relation to the preparation of reports, interim financial statements, estimates of receipts and expenditure, delivery of these documents and notification of significant events, as well as generally keeping relevant Ministers informed, are all drafted on the basis that they provide that the Directors must personally take the action, the subject of the section. I understand the Government believes that Courts will interpret this wording along the lines that the obligation on the Directors will be to cause these actions to be taken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my opinion, there is a real risk Courts will not be prepared to depart from the clear wording of the Bill, if and when a report is not provided on time or a relevant notification is not made. The Bill does not provide for Directors to be subject to penalties based on whether or not they have failed to take reasonable steps or whether or not they have failed to cause something to be done. Rather the Bill proceeds on the basis that if a report is not delivered or a notification is not made, the Directors are criminally liable for not delivering the report or not making the notification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you know, the provisions of the Bill have caused a great deal of concern amongst Directors of Commonwealth Statutory Corporations. It is a pity that a number of minor amendments of a drafting nature which would have substantially allayed the concerns of so many Directors, have not been agreed to by the Government, particularly when by the Government's own admission the amendments would have  made clear and beyond doubt the intention of the Government and the Parliament when these new personal duties, punishable by criminal sanction, were imposed on Directors of Commonwealth Corporations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Gibson, I understand your concern, and I acknowledge that this is not the first time you have raised the issue. You have been persistent in pushing this issue, which is to your credit. Your concern is that the provisions of the CAC Bill require directors to do certain things, whereas similar provisions in the Corporations Law require directors to cause those things to be done.

The reason for our opposition to this amendment is that, if carried, it would erode something that senators in this place have held as sacred: the independence of the Auditor-General. The assumption behind this amendment is that the Auditor-General ought to be able to be directed and that the Auditor-General can be directed by a committee of this parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make just one last foray on behalf of the government to try to deter the chamber from doing something that would damage the independence of the Auditor-General. I could agree broadly with Senator Spindler's contention were it not for the fact that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts also has the power to then review the Auditor-General's reports. So we have one committee saying to the Auditor-General that it thinks he should do something, and we have another committee asking the Auditor-General whether he has done it and what the outcome is. That would surround the Auditor-General with obligations which tarnish his standing as an independent officer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now put myself in the shoes of those senators who are supporting this amendment and offer what they may regard as&mdash;I hope they do not&mdash;gratuitous advice. It seems to me that the position from which they come is a reasonable one. That position is: we should retain a healthy suspicion anyway about whether any of these things are accurate, and we should commence a scrutiny of these reports from a sceptical standpoint. That is what scrutiny is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it strengthens the hand of the sceptic if it cannot be argued that the Auditor-General has been unduly influenced by obligations imposed on him by legislation and it can be argued that the Auditor-General is an honest, totally independent reporter. He is then the true witness. For sceptics to try to turn the Auditor-General into an agent of their scepticism to do and follow the avenues of investigation they want, whether or not it meets the needs of the Auditor-General, and then review the outcome and offer a report card with a distinction, pass or fail is the wrong way for this chamber to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the hand of the honest sceptic is best strengthened by an Auditor-General who is fiercely independent and unencumbered by these sorts of obligations so that the report that he then puts will still their scepticism or in fact encourage it but do so in the most independent way&mdash;otherwise he will be surrounded in a way in which it is open for some person to say, `Maybe he did it in this way because he was placed under a political obligation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say one final thing about this and then I will have said everything. The parliament is a political body selected by the people. It is a political house. Committees of the parliament are political. Committees of the parliament offering directions for inquiry and then examining and reporting on those directions of inquiry for an independent officer can be seen to be, in specific cases, acting politically for political purposes. You do not want that stain in any way to be attached to an independent officer such as the Auditor-General&mdash;you do not want it. To invite that type of allegation is to diminish the office. It is in the interest of holding the integrity of the office that I ask you not to proceed with your amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to support the Anzac Day Bill, which officially enshrines Anzac Day as `the national day to recognise and commemorate those who have served Australia in war and warlike conflicts'. I am delighted to say that this legislation has bipartisan support and I hope it will receive unanimous support from the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although originally on 25 April 1916 it was intended to commemorate the Anzac landing at Gallipoli one year earlier, Anzac Day has become accepted as the national day for remembering the sufferings and the sacrifices of all Australians as a result of war. This bill will formalise that recognition&mdash;a worthwhile move, particularly as the world makes ready for the 50th anniversary of the end of the 1939-1945 conflict in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anzac Day is unique in that it is a national day of commemoration based on what ultimately proved to be a military defeat. Some countries and some individuals may find that rather strange, but the reality is that this point undermines that this is a day of genuine reflection on our past. It is not merely some grandiose exercise to celebrate a military victory or to glorify war. It is about the losses and the sacrifices made by the people of this nation when they were called on to take up arms or to make some other contribution to restoring peace around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has never been about glory, whether on the part of individuals or on the part of the nation as a whole. Anzac Day is about the commemoration and remembrance of the sacrifices made by generations of Australians in defence of the nation and of our beliefs in democracy, and it is the commemoration of one of the major milestones in creating our national character. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's history of involvement in overseas conflicts is decades older than the federation itself. The first military action seen by Australians in any organised fashion occurred in New Zealand in 1860 during the second Anglo-Maori war. About 2,500 soldiers and a Victorian ship fought in support of New Zealand regiments. This came 55 years before the Gallipoli landings. Those are the landings which many historians have described as the real forging of Australia's national identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the figures, it is rather incredible for such a small nation which has experienced only limited attacks on its own soil to have lost over 100,000 of its sons and daughters in war service, with some 225,000 wounded and 34,730 held as prisoners of war. During World War I more than 400,000 Australians enlisted&mdash;more than 10 per cent of the total population. More than 60,000 of those died and another 150,000 were wounded. This meant that virtually no family in the whole nation was unscarred by that conflict. These casualties were horrendous even on the scale suffered by many of the great military powers at that time, but they have deeply burned into the soul of our country, which was then so small and at that time was only beginning to find its feet as an independent nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a reflection of Australia's multicultural heritage in the fact that almost one-third of the personnel in our units in Gallipoli had originally come to this country as migrants. Migration has always been the backbone of Australia's development, and the fact that so many of our Anzacs were migrants is something which should be made better known to all Australians. To do so would be to ensure that the aims of this bill&mdash;the official creation of a national day of commemoration&mdash;would attract the interest and support of many of our migrant communities as well as those whose families have lived here for generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is also another opportunity for the nation to recognise the contribution of our Aboriginal community in the service of the nation's defence and to promote the ideals of reconciliation through jointly celebrating Anzac Day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like most members of this chamber and the other place, I personally have been very struck by the solemnity, dignity and importance of Anzac Day to our communities. It is a source of great amazement to me that often at four or five o'clock in the morning hundreds of people of all ages&mdash;young and old&mdash;will get up to attend dawn services around this country, some with just a handful of people, some with thousands of people. Many of them&mdash;and increasingly so more recently&mdash;are wearing their fathers' medals on the opposite breast. The spirit which is present at those services has often been commented on by overseas visitors as something which amazes them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this bill we should also recognise the amazing contribution made by the diggers, not only as soldiers but, since their return, as members of the RSL. The RSL has done much for our community, not only in inspiring mateship but also in looking after the needy in our society and providing an ongoing spirit of comradeship. I think that is something we should recognise&mdash;indeed, we should shout it from the rooftops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that this bill is an example of how parliamentarians can work together to ensure something worth while for the community, despite the many pressures of the day-to-day political battles. This legislation is the result of direct cooperation between the government and the opposition, and has emerged from a flood of petitions from ex-service groups across the nation. It is a very sad reflection on the mind-set of our media that they have shown virtually no interest in this legislation, despite its overwhelming community support and the level of political cooperation behind its advancement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is designed to achieve its stated purpose&mdash;to enshrine Anzac Day as a national day of commemoration. But I should point out that it in no way impinges on the Australia Day celebrations which occur on 26 January each year. The bill has been widely&mdash;and wrongly&mdash;interpreted by some groups as some kind of threat to Australia Day's place as our national day. It will do no such thing. It will do no more than officially recognise 25 April as our national day of commemoration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is meant to formally recognise the national significance of 25 April to all Australians&mdash;as a day to remember, a day to pay our respects to those who died, suffered or served in war.

The Democrats in the past have moved amendments to grant our defence personnel the right of conscientious objection to combat duties except in the time of attack or threatened attack on Australia.

Having said that, the Australian Democrats are proud to support this legislation, and we commend the government's initiative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Anzac Day Bill 1994, which will set aside 25 April each year as the national day of commemoration to recognise and commemorate the contribution of all Australians who serve this nation in times of war and warlike conflict. The impetus for this bill was a notice of motion by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, Mr Clyde Holding, in the other place last year. As he rightly stated, the national importance of the commemoration of Anzac Day, which currently comes under state legislation, should more appropriately become a federal responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every year sees a reduction in the ranks of those Australians who served as Anzacs in the First World War and also a thinning of the ranks of Second World War veterans who, on average, I now believe to be around 77 years of age. In the face of ever-dwindling numbers, it is important that this nation preserve for ever more, through the Anzac Day Bill, 25 April as the national day of commemoration for those who served and for those who made the ultimate sacrifice for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been asserted before, the Australian nationhood was shaped through the Anzac experience at Gallipoli. It was the first time Australians had fought together as united Australians rather than as colonists. It came, however, at a huge cost in Australian lives. The fatally flawed Gallipoli campaign saw the death of 7,600 Australians and 2,500 New Zealanders. The rationale for this ill-conceived plan was to weaken Turkey by forcing a passage through the Dardanelles and bombarding Constantinople. As Manning Clark wrote, rather charitably:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was a plan for romantics, a plan for those who believed a rich prize outweighed the suffering, cruelty and losses. It was a grand design of a swift end to the war in the Middle East that ended in a military disaster.</PARA>
<PARA>On 3 April 1915 the Australian and New Zealand forces of around 50,000 men, comprising the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th Divisions, departed Cairo for Alexandria and then the Dardanelles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before dawn on 25 April the advance party rowed for shore. The cove where it landed was enclosed by steep cliffs which were defended by massive Turkish firepower. From April to December the diggers valiantly hung on in the trenches as they continued their assault on the Dardanelles. Finally, after eight grim nightmare months, with a huge toll extracted in human life and suffering, the word finally came from London to abandon the campaign. Again, Manning Clark encapsulates it so well:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The soldiers were in part apotheosised by the ashes of defeat, for from that year, the landing at Gallipoli became Anzac Day. For some it symbolised the noblest aspirations of the people. For others it was the bond of those who had been through the fiery furnace and uplifted by it.</PARA>
<PARA>After the Gallipoli campaign the general staff moved the forces from Egypt to the western front in north-eastern France and Belgium for the remainder of the war. The first war saw a generation of young Australians perish. There has been enough written of that war, from the poetry of Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon to the memoirs of Albert Facey and most recently Robert Malloy, as testimony to its horrors to guard against its glorification. However, our war experiences will always be remembered and the brave Australians who served and those who paid the ultimate price should be forever honoured in our collective memories on our national day as provided for in this Anzac Day Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a grandson of an Anzac who rests in France, I am particularly proud to take part in this debate today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge my contribution to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill as a trustee of the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Trust.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One solution could well have been the exercise of a trustee's discretion in arbitrarily extending the time frame but this would have the downside of being open to challenge. Therefore, the only open, honest and fair approach was by way of amendment to the principal act which effectively extends the discretionary period from six to 12 months&mdash;and this is what this bill purports to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment will allow certain former members and senators who re-enter the parliament to repay lump sums paid under the principal act and to receive recognition of prior parliamentary service for future benefit purposes. The principal act actually provides that these members may enter contracts with the trust to repay the actual lump sum received within three years of re-entering parliament and the trust has discretion to offer contracts on such terms as it thinks fit. The current provision, prior to this amendment, allows the affected member to re-enter such a contract within three months of re-entering the parliament, with the trust having the discretion to extend this period to six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill extends the period during which the trust has a discretion to extend the contract from six to 12 months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill is another example of the inability of the present Labor government to negotiate treaties and other agreements and keep Australia's interests to the forefront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was unfortunate that it was the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, who dashed the Australian and New Zealand hopes of a removal of a major impediment to trans-Tasman investment to recognise New Zealand company franking credits. I remind the Senate that since 1988 committees have been continually looking at harmonisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that we have not made more progress with CER especially when we are starting to talk about closer ties to the north under APEC. First, we must get our relationship with New Zealand right. I put this parliament and the people of Australia on notice that one of the first things the Liberal and National parties will do, on return to government, is to speed up the harmonisation process, not only of tax but of trade and all other aspects of our relationship with our closest neighbour, New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill gives the force of law in Australia to a comprehensive double tax arrangement which was signed with New Zealand on 27 January 1995. The provisions of the agreement closely follow and correspond with those in Australia's other modern double tax agreements. It replaces an earlier agreement concluded in 1972 and reflects major tax reforms in both countries since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, the agreement ensures that all forms of income flowing between the two countries are taxed only once and provides for cooperation between the tax authorities to prevent tax evasion and it certainly clarifies certain trans-Tasman tax issues. It also provides for a clarification of which country has the tax rights over categories of trans-Tasman income flows. It updates the double tax agreement and closer cooperation between the two revenue authorities which is designed to enhance trade and investment opportunities and to protect both countries' revenue bases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that Australian companies investing in New Zealand have received a boost following the signing of what the government at the time referred to as a historic double tax agreement, because it did, I acknowledge, remove a number of costly barriers. But it is important to spell out to this Senate what the bill does not do. It does not deal with the vexed issue of sharing dividend imputation credits. The inability of Australian companies to use New Zealand tax credits and the New Zealand withholding tax on dividends paid back to Australia are major frustrations for Australian groups with trans-Tasman operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also opportune to remind the Senate of a recent statement by one of Australia's leading tax accountants from Price Waterhouse, Geoffrey Leeman, who said that it was ironic that Australia and New Zealand could not get mutual recognition of each other's tax credits, when Ireland and Finland had agreed to theirs. It makes a joke of our government's preaching internationalisation to business if it cannot negotiate completely open commercial relations with our nearest neighbour. That is in an environment when the government is talking about having closer relations under an APEC regime, which will create many more difficulties than a proper harmonisation with our closest neighbour, New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill purports to clarify which country has taxing rights over various categories of trans-Tasman income and income flows. I suppose one issue that I should draw the Senate's attention to is fringe benefits tax. The fringe benefits tax regime we have in Australia is unique around the world and causes a lot of problems in terms of international tax treaties. But the new treaty does provide taxpayer relief from the double taxation of fringe benefits. The country with the sole or primary taxing right to the remuneration of the individual taxpayer associated with the fringe benefit will have the sole right to tax the fringe benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, where an employee's assessable income is taxable in New Zealand, fringe benefits provided to that employee will, naturally, be taxable in New Zealand. Previously, such benefits were not taxable in New Zealand as fringe benefits although they may have been treated as ordinary income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other issues which are outlined and which I do not have the time to examine in detail are income from employment, dividends and trans-Tasman insurance business, interest, royalties, business profits and permanent establishments, capital gains, income from real property, substantial equipment and permanent establishments, pensions and annuities and permanent establishments and holdings in unit trusts, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, however, important to highlight some of those aspects that affect dividends. In terms of withholding tax on dividends, Australia will reduce its rate of withholding tax on unfranked dividends paid by Australian resident companies to New Zealand residents from 30 per cent of the gross amount of dividends to 15 per cent. Franked dividends paid by Australian resident companies to New Zealand residents will continue to be exempt and trans-Tasman insurance business dividend withholding tax is limited to five per cent to reflect the five per cent branch profits tax equivalent to that which New Zealand imposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps of more significance in terms of the harmonisation which has happened in recent times is not only the result of this bill which is before us but also tax reform by the New Zealand government. We all know that the New Zealand government is very keen on promoting the liberalisation of trade and business in that country. It has removed a lot of red tape in New Zealand and, as a consequence, New Zealand business is thriving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out the most recent initiative taken by the New Zealand government in relation to tax issues. The result of that initiative will be that Australian companies investing in New Zealand will now face significantly lower tax rates on dividends later in this year as a result of those particular reforms. For example, New Zealand non-resident withholding tax has effectively been removed for franked dividends. The initiative of the New Zealand government is not matched by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the Coopers Lybrand Sydney comment that `this New Zealand initiative does remove a huge obstacle that has been lying like a log across this motorway for years'. In fact, the proposals will have a dramatic impact on the profile of trans-Tasman investment and will force almost every Australian group with New Zealand operations to look at restructuring their particular financing arrangements. Many Australian based groups with profitable New Zealand subsidiaries will be able to bring profits back to Australia in the form of dividends with a more palatable overall tax cost even though, I must point out, mutual recognition of franking credits still has not been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this initiative from New Zealand, Australia will actually get millions of dollars through the New Zealand tax reform. It is providing initiatives which Australia is not matching. Therefore, the concept of harmonisation is pretty much one-sided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate of a commitment made by John Hewson when he indicated that a Liberal-National coalition will certainly speed up the harmonisation concept and do everything that is reasonably possible to develop a common market between Australia and New Zealand. To that end he announced eight steps to improve CER and to enable that process to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us was absolutely necessary in terms of an outdated agreement from 1972. I believe that we lost a great opportunity in the negotiations with New Zealand in not speeding up the harmonisation process and, as such, I think we have not done ourselves a great deal of service in trying to improve relationships between Australia and New Zealand. In many respects New Zealand is economically outstripping Australia's performance&mdash;and that is reflected in the dollar exchange rate movements in the respective countries. Australia has a lot to learn from New Zealand and I urge this government to speed up the harmonisation process. In the meantime, the Liberal-National Party coalition does support the steps that have been taken, albeit they are fairly inadequate in terms of what is really required. </PARA>

I ask whether the minister is aware that, according to the latest Reuters survey, 21 of the 25 major Australian economists surveyed believe that interest rates will rise in April&mdash;just after the New South Wales election? Nineteen of them expect the next rate hike to be between three-quarters of a per cent and one per cent, with many believing that official rates could rise from 7 1/2 per cent to 10 per cent in the second half of this year.

So claims that the government is allowing universities to charge undergraduate fees are quite unfounded. Australian undergraduate students who gain a place at a public institution cannot be charged tuition fees. In 1993 the number of non-award students was equivalent to just over one per cent of all students.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the campaign director for the Liberal Party in Canberra made an allegation that the Electoral Commission had mailed out Labor Party propaganda in normal Electoral Commission mail-outs. I think most people in this chamber with experience of dealing with the Electoral Commission would know that is patent nonsense. Of courses it is nonsense, but we had to put the matter in the hands of the Federal Police because it was a serious charge. On Tuesday, 21 March the Federal Police reported back to government there was absolutely no evidence whatsoever to sustain this particular charge. Of course the effect was that the Liberal Party was able to obtain a few days cheap publicity. We know the motive for that. The motive for that was to cast around to find some distracter from the disgraceful push polling tactics the Liberal Party has adopted in this particular by-election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication by the Liberal Party that the Electoral Commission would involve itself in this sort of behaviour is in line with the clear pattern of behaviour by the Liberal Party in perverse poll tactics adopted in the Canberra by-election and elsewhere. One of the things that it does is divert the attention of the Electoral Commission and others from the proper course of their duties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Electoral Commission has many things on its plate. For instance, it has to investigate how the $100,000 and $50,000 donations from shelf companies from Hong Kong and Singapore related to Gerard Industries happened to find their way into Liberal Party coffers. The commission should not be distracted from the investigation as to whether there was some coincidence between those donations from those shelf companies and certain contracts with the person who arranged those donations to the Liberal Party to be entered into with the state government of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt the Electoral Commission has to put up with investigations as to various apparatchiks from the New South Wales branch trying to threaten pizza parlour owners because they happen to put up a sign in their backyard. Maybe the Electoral Commission has to follow up other sorts of false claims from Senator Tierney about all sorts of invented deals and preference swaps.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I reject the assertion that one of my colleagues just made that as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy I would want to spray the Flying Fruit Fly Circus! I actually concur with Senator Bourne; it is a national treasure. I must say in relation to the brief that I have been given by the Minister for Communications and the Arts that there has been a very significant amount of support given to the Flying Fruit Fly Circus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1984 the Commonwealth government has provided over $1 million to enable the Flying Fruit Fly Circus to establish itself. Within the communication and arts portfolio, the Australia Council has supported the circus since its establishment in 1979. The Australia Council currently provides a multi-year grant of $90,000 a year. This is more than twice the level of support offered to any other company in the youth arts program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the circus is eligible for support for touring costs through the Playing Australia program. An application for a grant for tours to Brisbane and Sydney will be considered by the Playing Australia committee at its next meeting in early April. The company is also eligible for financial assistance through the department's new Festivals Australia program to support the touring of companies to regional festivals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the Commonwealth's funding to the circus has been through the Department of Employment, Education and Training in recognition of the training services provided by the company. This has involved grants of up to $130,000 a year through the projects of national significance program. These funds were provided over the past 10 years as seed funding to meet the costs of the training and administrative staff of the circus. As seed funding obviously has a limited life, since 1993 the company has been aware that funding from this program would be phased out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circus has discussed this change of funding with the government. The Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mr Lee, met with the artistic director of the circus, Mr Charles Parkinson, last week to discuss future funding of the company. The Australia Council convened a meeting at which a number of options were canvassed which provided opportunities for additional support for the circus. These are also being currently pursued. As an established company, the circus now has access to other government programs such as those listed above, as well as seeking corporate and other sponsorships which an organisation of this nature deserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circus is an annex of the Wodonga government high school.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that there have been cuts in health and hospital funding in New South Wales, but those cuts are entirely from the New South Wales government. They are cuts by the Fahey government; they are not cuts at all by the Commonwealth government.

In 1988-89 New South Wales spent $1.2 billion, while in 1993-94 it spent only $1 billion. In real terms, this is a drop of more than a quarter of a billion dollars to New South Wales hospitals by the New South Wales government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the same period, the Commonwealth hospital funding to all states, including New South Wales, has been growing.

In real terms, this is an increase of more than three quarters of a billion dollars&mdash;over $752 million. Commonwealth increases, state decreases: they are the facts in New South Wales.

Our customer does know that we are prepared to say that obviously they are a customer of the Bank, and do have longstanding and current borrowing arrangements with the Bank, and that the branch is meeting its obligation, as you said, under arrangements that were negotiated on a commercial basis and at a commercial rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THOMPSON: Can you say whether the loan arrangement with the ALP has been extended for the NSW election?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEAVES: No, it certainly hasn't been&mdash;so we haven't assisted and we haven't been approached to assist with the funding for the campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THOMPSON: In the Senate, Senator Michael Baume says that the rate of interest on the $6 million mortgage held by the ALP is $10,000 a week&mdash;working out to be $520,000 a year or about 9%. That certainly seems to be less than the commercial rate of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEAVES: Well, unless you knew the way it was negotiated and the state of the debt, it would not be possible for you to draw that inference. They are paying a commercial rate and that's all we're prepared to say.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEAVES: The State ALP would be like any customer, they would constantly be looking at their borrowings from the Bank, looking at rates&mdash;and I think that's a prudent practice that any business or anybody who is borrowing would adopt. It's been nothing more than that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THOMPSON: Has the Bank threatened a notice of foreclosure on the ALP's debt?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEAVES: No.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THOMPSON: It's been claimed that essentially the ALP is in technical default on its loan. Is that so?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEAVES: Well, if we've said they are meeting commercial obligations, then I don't see how you could draw that inference. It's just that. They are meeting a commercially negotiated arrangement at a commercial rate of interest. Really, we just wanted to put paid to some of the allegations that were being raised yesterday, to make clear the position. But really beyond that, it's probably best to talk to the State ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THOMPSON: Have you, that is the Commonwealth Bank, have you had consultations or discussions with any of the Coalition Members about these claims?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEAVES: No, not that I'm aware of. I'm not aware that we've been either approached or aware of any discussions with the Coalition on this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THOMPSON: Can you say in general, is there any substance in the claims being made by the Coalition about preferential treatment?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEAVES: It's absolutely untrue. There is no preferential treatment here. It's not in our interests, it's not in the interests of our customer. We rely on commercial dealings in good faith&mdash;that underpins prudent management of the Bank&mdash;and that's the way we like to conduct our business, and it's certainly the way we've been conducting it with the State ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THOMPSON: Has the ALP's account been transferred to the Group Credit Control section of the Bank, which is a section which usually deals with potentially bad debts?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEAVES: We have lending specialists, and from time to time various accounts will go to the lending specialists area&mdash;so that's really nothing to get excited about. I think somebody's drawn the wrong conclusion from that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THOMPSON: So it has been handed over to the Credit Control section?</PARA>

This contrasts sharply with the period under the previous government which saw a steady decline in the total resources available per student. In 1983 total resources per student were 17.6 per cent less than in 1975. That, I think, is a complete answer to the further allegations that were made in Senator Hill's question today.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator, for prompting me. I will deal with that if you will keep quiet for just a bit. The arrangements include a mixture of longstanding and current borrowing arrangements with the Commonwealth Bank. The bank says that the Labor Party is meeting its obligations to the bank under arrangements that were negotiated in a commercial manner and include a commercial rate of interest. For the minister's benefit, because he obviously could not add up when he misled the Senate yesterday, $10,000 a week represents $520,000 a year. On a $6 million overdraft, that represents 8 1/2 per cent. What we were asking, quite properly, is why the Labor Party gets such a beneficial interest rate on such a loan when it is a risky borrower, a high risk borrower. It is such a high risk borrower that its liabilities massively exceed its assets. It has been put into a special category&mdash;which is dealt with later by the bank&mdash;where people who are having difficulties with clients are put. This category normally includes bad or doubtful debts and where provision is made against that debt by the bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was intrigued to see the response of the bank person. I quote from the interview with Andrew Olle this morning. Mr Olle says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have you, as has been alleged by Michael Baume, transferred the debt from normal accounts into the hands of your group credit control, which is seen as a potential bad debt?</PARA>

It reminds me of the way Senator Evans responds when he is very uneasy about the answer and he says, `I am advised that'. Each time I put up an issue regarding this matter, he has said `I am advised that' or `I am told that'. It is because he has no confidence in the answers.

Senator Evans, the reason I ask that is very simple. After your inaccurate statements of yesterday, I am intrigued as to whether you would like now to go on the record as denying that any interest payments on this mortgage have been paid in cash. You asserted yesterday that they were all being paid by cheque&mdash;I presume now; I assume your wording was very careful, and not going back into previous payments. I once again ask you to come clean. Will you deny that any interest payments on this mortgage have been paid in cash? Will you or your relevant colleagues authorise the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the cash transaction centre, Austrac, which has to take a record of cash transactions, to make a public statement to test whether you are wrong again?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have been able to go along with the Commonwealth Bank to answer selected questions. How about coming clean on the lot? Senator Evans, if you have got nothing to hide, come clean on whether there have been any cash payments and how much they were for. I can tell you that I am advised&mdash;and that is not one of your ducking phrases `I am advised'&mdash;and I am very well informed that substantial cash payments were made to make up for the fact that the Labor Party did not meet some of its interest repayments as they fell due last year. I am advised that that is the reason this account is in the close watch area of the Commonwealth Bank, and that these cash deposits were made to catch up on that failure to pay. Quite frankly, when cash deposits are made in such a situation, you may have a problem with the Electoral Act relating to donations in cash. That is just a by-the-way issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am particularly concerned about is that this statement by the bank assures us&mdash;and I accept that assurance&mdash;that it has not extended preferential treatment for political reasons.

There must be some other reason for a high risk debtor being given extraordinarily friendly terms and a very generous interest rate when, in fact, it has at times failed to meet the payments. That has not been denied by the Commonwealth Bank. All the representative of the Commonwealth Bank said was, `Not that I am aware of.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans, I suggest that you draw your attention to the response by Ms Deves&mdash;I notice that you did not table this interview, naturally&mdash;in the interview this morning when Andrew Olle asked:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that it is students who so strongly supported this Labor government at the last election who are now protesting about its policies in the strongest terms. As I said in my question today, students feel that they have been misled. In fact, students believe that they were lied to at the last election, so much so that their own president said, `The government has lied to undergraduate students claiming that they would be protected from up-front fees.' I understand that this president of the National Union of Students is, in fact, a member of the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the extent of disillusionment of students with this government's policies. This is only reflective of a wider community disillusionment with Labor and its performance in office&mdash;just another sector of the community that is now coming forward and saying, `We were misled. We were lied to in the last election. We will stick it no longer. We must go out there and protest. We must protest against the misrepresentations that were made by this government.' Again, the only response of those opposite is to laugh at them. The government is not laughing at us. It is laughing at the Australian students whom it conned at the last election and whom it will not be able to con again. The government misled them once, but it will not mislead them again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the period of this Labor government, public funding per student has in fact decreased by about 15 per cent. If the government wants the authority for that, it should look at the DEET annual report 1994-95 and also the DEET Higher Education Council resource allocation paper on higher education. Public funding per student has been substantially reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result has been that Australian universities have been under enormous financial pressure.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are distressed about the quality of their product deteriorating. They are disturbed by the fact that they are having huge class sizes&mdash;over 500 students per class. Students are sitting in the aisles. They are distressed that the whole tutorial system is breaking down because there are simply too many students per tute to allow it to function properly. They are distressed by the fact that libraries in Australian universities cannot cope with the numbers and the quality of particularly undergraduate first degrees is deteriorating. Students are angry about that and they are taking out their wrath on this government, and so they should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the universities therefore saying? They are saying they have no alternative but to seek to broaden their financial base in such ways as the government gives them a wink and a nod for. This government said that it was against up-front fees. But when the universities feel that they have no alternative but to charge undergraduate fees through commercial companies, this government gives them a wink and a nod. That is the way universities are supposed to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government said to Australian students that it is against up-front fees but, of course, subsequent to the election, it would allow universities to charge such fees for postgraduate degrees&mdash;research and class degrees. It would open that door, and it basically expected the universities to pass through it. Why? Because the government wants universities to stand the political cost of having angry students. The government is not prepared to face up to its own responsibility. It is its policies&mdash;the policies that Senator Schacht talked about today&mdash;that have resulted in this crisis in higher education, the deteriorating quality in degrees and the anger that is being expressed by students and their teachers today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, those people will not be misled again. They have every right to feel disillusioned with this government. They have every right to say they were conned at the last election, but they will not be conned again. It is sad that they feel that they have no alternative but to join those other sectors of the Australian community that are also now saying they were lied to once and will not be lied to again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the next occasion, the Australian people will not believe the promises that the government makes. They will not believe the government in light of the fact that it has its National Union of Students pouring $100,000 of student money into a campaign to support it. Conned once, but conned twice they will not be. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Hill's remarks. What is happening with higher education at the moment is an absolute disgrace. The outcome of that disgrace is, of course, the fact that students, for the first time in history, have downed pens and are not going to lectures today because of the absolute failure of this government's higher education policy since the advent of the Dawkinisation of the universities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was supposed to be a marvellous panacea for higher education, but what have we seen in terms of outcomes? Senator Forshaw would appreciate the fact that, initially, 50,000 students were without places but that figure, even with the changes that this government has lauded over the last few years and since I came to this place, has only just been pushed to under 30,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That many students are still being turned away from our universities. Are they being turned away from universities where all the provision is there? No, they are not. What this government has done in the expansion of higher education has been done on an absolute shoestring. The government's back is now forced against the wall because tutorial class sizes have increased, lecture class sizes have increased and the buildings are so run down in a lot of places that they are not really fit for lectures. The government has not put enough money into capital works. One library in Adelaide banned students from other universities from using it because it did not have the people to stack the books again. That is the way this Labor government has allowed this system to become run down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the cumulation of all those things today. Students have every right to be angry. If they have worked towards, made sacrifices for and got themselves a position on a university campus, they have the right to expect first-class treatment. We have in this country first-class academics, but we do not have first-class facilities. Class sizes are too big, buildings are run down and resources are diminishing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With its back against the wall, what is this government's response to funding higher education properly? It has wasted so much money in budgets over the years it is obviously finding it cannot finance out of the budget further expansion. So it has come down to a point where more and more fees are being charged for courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absolute hypocrisy of this government is demonstrated by comparing what it is doing now with what it promised before the last election. The government had students supporting it out there in the streets during the last election. It had great numbers of students voting for it in the last election. Students now feel they have been totally betrayed by this government because of what it has done in relation to fees since that time. In relation to students having to pay for full fees, we have seen a gradual encroachment into the higher education sector initially in the area of postgraduate degrees. People are now having to pay full fees for many courses where only a small fee was charged. We are also now finding that that also applies to undergraduate courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's spokesman in my area was Frank Walker. At a public meeting attended by 600 people he said, `If the Liberals get in, they will charge you full fees after the election.' That was not true. It was never our policy, but it is the reality today under this government. At the University of Western Sydney there is the case of a civil aviation undergraduate batchelor's course&mdash;$55,000 for the fees. The government is bringing it in by stealth. As Senator Hill said, the government does not want to take the odium for it; it is trying to put it on the universities. That will not wash. We know the responsibility is with the government. Undergraduate fees are coming in by stealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In estimates one month ago I asked the deputy secretary whether a number of institutions have set up companies where students are paying full fees. What did Mr Phillips say? He said that, if it were an award of the university, the university would be in breach of the act if it charged fees. I asked him the question in three different ways subsequent to that and, like Sir Humphrey, he came back and gave that exact answer again. The lie has been put to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the University of Western Sydney and a number of others, this government is allowing full fees for undergraduate courses. We have students marching in the streets against this. We have them marching in the streets against the poor facilities in the universities because of this government's underspending. The government deserves the odium that is coming upon it from students.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Chris Evans this day, relating to confidential Aboriginal documents concerning the site for the proposed Hindmarsh Island bridge.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to concur with the minister's concern about the treatment of Aboriginal cultural and religious sensitivities in this issue by the Liberal Party. The whole episode has been nothing short of a disgrace. The Aboriginal communities and people I have spoken to are most concerned about the treatment of their culture in this whole issue. But more concerning of late has been the way that error, that disgraceful treatment of Aboriginal people, has been compounded by the defence of Mr McLachlan's actions offered by Mr John Howard and now by Mr Peter Costello. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than saying that the resignation by Mr McLachlan was recognition of the error made and accepting that Mr McLachlan had made a mistake, they have gone out of their way to defend his actions. They have alleged that it is merely a technical breach and that he is an honourable man and would be welcomed back into the shadow ministry at any time. That does not concern me in the sense that Mr McLachlan did not fire a shot in all the years he was in the shadow ministry and no-one on this side fears his return; but, in terms of the principle at stake, it is a most concerning development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is John Howard, as the minister suggested, going to make Mr McLachlan shadow minister for Australia Post if he is returned to the shadow ministry and have him open the mail all around Australia? There is no contrition at all on behalf of the Liberal Party of the actions of Mr McLachlan. There is no rejection of his action. He not only opened the mail that was clearly directed to somebody else but also distributed that mail as far and as wide as possible and distributed that mail to persons who were in legal dispute with the parties for whom that mail was intended. That was a quite outrageous action on his behalf and it really does behove the Liberal Party leadership to disassociate itself from those actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But no, Mr Howard has defended those actions. In doing so, he has raised a real question mark in Australian society about his own performance, about his own morality and about whether or not he is able to distance himself from the right wing that seems to have taken over the Liberal Party in recent years. Clearly the treatment of Aboriginal issues by this Liberal Party would not have occurred under former Aboriginal affairs ministers, such as Viner and Chaney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen is this extreme right wing view take hold in the Liberal Party. Obviously, John Howard is a captive of that view and represents that extreme right wing position. We saw what that influence did to Alexander Downer, who was beaten into confusing policy positions by Richard Court's insistence that he oppose the Native Title Act. He went to the Northern Territory and imploded as he was unable to come to grips with what was required of him in terms of Liberal Party policy on Aboriginal affairs because of the real conflicts within the party and the fact that it fails to have any sensitivity or appreciation of the needs of Aboriginal people in Australia. This issue has raised question marks not only about John Howard but clearly also about the opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs, Chris Gallus.

Mr Howard knew 10 days beforehand. So either he has no confidence in her and refused to tell her, or she was an accomplice in and was part of that orchestrated decision to use that material&mdash;material illegally obtainedand released&mdash;in question time in the House of Representatives to try to attack the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, Mrs Gallus is either irrelevant and does not enjoy the confidence of Mr Howard or she was an accomplice in this abuse and she ought to resign as shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The Keating government is the government of the true deceivers. Having won office by the most dishonest election campaign ever waged in Australia, it has since reneged on all its major promises. As John Howard says, we have had five minutes of economic sunshine before getting clobbered with the same sorts of higher interest rates that the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, used to create the last recession, which he said we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, in its latest set of forecasts points out that recent increases in Australia's prime business lending rates have restored them to their highest level for three years. ABARE expects further short-term interest rate rises during the remainder of 1995, with the prime rate rising from an average of nine per cent last year to around 10.5 per cent this year and 11.5 per cent in the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should business believe the government's assurances that interest rates are unlikely to rise further when one of its major economic advisers is telling it that further increases will be required to control significant inflationary pressures? But when are they going to come? They will not come until after next Saturday, until after the next state election, because this government is applying the same sort of dishonest campaigning that it applied to its own election&mdash;the most dishonest campaign ever&mdash;to the state election campaign in New South Wales. Only after that New South Wales state election is out of the way will the nasties begin to hit us again from the federal government, especially interest rates, which will seriously affect the finances of all the states but in particular the very well run states like New South Wales, which has an outstanding record of economic management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have to deal with here is the simple question of what sort of leadership we have both in the New South Wales Labor Party and the Labor Party federally. It is appropriate that this government is led by the right wing of the New South Wales Labor Party. Look at the names: Mr Keating, Mr Brereton, former senator Richardson&mdash;he is an admitted true deceiver&mdash;and Mr Punch. Then there is an honorary member of the Right who is a leftie, Mr Walker. This group of the New South Wales right have one interest&mdash;the exercise of power&mdash;and they seek it by hook or by crook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last federal election they did it by crook. In the present state election in New South Wales they have been hooked. And the hook they are on is their own financial incompetence. How can a party run the finances of the state or of the nation when it cannot even manage its own finances? You cannot trust Labor with money, and you certainly cannot trust Labor with power because that is the way it gets money; it gets money by exercising its power. We can see the extraordinary chaos that the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party is in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Carr, the New South Wales Labor leader, says, `It's not my fault that the New South Wales Labor Party has a huge debt, $6 million on mortgage and another $4 million in various other ways with the Commonwealth Bank. It's not my fault that we have a $6 million mortgage, in particular, secured by less than $2 million of assets. It's not my fault that if the bank foreclosed, the Labor Party would be broke. It's all an administrative problem. It's the administration that does that.' Is it really a matter for Labor's administrative committee? Mr Carr is a member of Labor's administrative committee. Rule D2a(2) of Labor's constitution states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The state parliamentary leader is a member of the administrative committee.</PARA>
<PARA>Rule D5b states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The administrative committee will also present annual conference with a balance sheet which has been audited and also a statement of the general financial position of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA>Is that not fascinating&mdash;an audited statement. Let me tell honourable senators: there is no audited statement of the organisation that is in fact sending the Labor Party broke&mdash;that is, Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd. We can rely for that fact on the Australian Securities Commission because it has not received an audited statement. Not only that; in the latest inadequate annual return from this sinking ship we see that Mr John Della Bosca, who signed the return, has ticked the box that says, `There are no audited accounts. The auditor has not audited the accounts.' That, frankly, is a disgrace. The ASC received an undertaking from the Labor Party last year that it would file accounts by 30 June last year. It did not happen. Nor did it happen that the Labor Party has advised the ASC that the auditor has at last audited the accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot get around the law by using a sneaky device that says, `Oh, we have an auditor, therefore we don't have to present accounts to the ASC', when, in fact, the auditor has not audited the accounts. It is the sort of typical, devious, sneaky, dishonest approach that you would expect from a Labor Party controlled by the right wing in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sort of style of this party is evident from a statutory declaration from a constituent of mine, who went to see Mr Paul Crittenden, a Labor MP from Toukley. He went to him because he had some problems and he wanted to get them resolved. Do you know what he was told when he went there? He was told, `If you make a $300 donation we will look into the matter further.' That is the sort of help and consideration that fits exactly into the style of the right wing dominated Australian Labor Party in New South Wales. And it starts at the top. Bob Carr is a member of the committee that is supposed to be involved in presenting the accounts of this shonky organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us deal with the responses by Senator Evans today, because a whole series of proper questions were asked. The farmers in New South Wales are being pushed off their land by the bank. I will not go into the rights and wrongs of what the bank is doing. All I know is this: it is treating those people very differently from the way it is treating the ALP. If the spokesman for the bank says that it is not right to say that the interest rate is about 8 1/2 or 9 per cent, it is very hard to work out another interest rate, is it not, when the Labor Party has been paying this figure, either by cash or by cheque&mdash;it missed some of its payments so it had to pay by cash. The fact is when you have a situation where this bank is allowing this high risk client whose liabilities massively exceed its assets to have an extraordinarily low rate of interest&mdash;and apparently not to be involved in any repayments of the principle; there is no way that kind of payment would involve any repayment of the principle&mdash;then the people of Australia have a right to ask questions about what sort of arrangements seem to be going on when the Labor Party is involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet what do we hear from the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans? Every time I have asked him a question I have been given a misleading, disgraceful answer which he has had to withdraw and correct because he was 75 per cent wrong. He claimed that the Labor Party was repaying the debt; this is simply untrue. It is not repaying a cracker. It is simply paying the interest bill. So Senator Evans is misleading the Senate again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does Senator Evans have to hide? Why won't he answer the questions about whether or not cash payments&mdash;brown envelopes&mdash;have been made to pay the Labor Party's back debt?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Senator Baume stood up to put forward this matter of public importance, I thought to myself, `Come in spinner.' If ever there was someone desperate to lead with his chin, it has been Senator Baume this afternoon. He said nothing at all about taxpayers' funds, but he tried to make a case regarding private dealings. If Senator Baume wants to help his coalition partners in New South Wales, he ought to stay clear of references to private dealings and private actions that have anything to do with the ability to manage taxpayers' funds. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if that is the path Senator Baume wants to go down, let us see where it leads us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to the relationship between private dealings and the public management of taxpayers' funds, the New South Wales coalition government has the most appalling record. Let us look at that record. Who was a member of the New South Wales government&mdash;the government responsible for looking after taxpayers' funds in New South Wales? None other than Phillip Smiles, a convicted tax cheat. If you were going to talk about managing taxpayers' money, you would not ask Phillip Smiles, because he does not believe in paying tax. He does not like being a taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to Terry Metherell. Do you remember Terry Metherell, the minister for education some years ago? He was a senior minister found cheating on his tax. He resigned from the ministry and became an Independent. Then a former Premier Nick Greiner and a former minister Tim Moore tried to use the public purse to get Terry Metherell to resign from the parliament so that they could get the numbers to save their sleazy government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Baume wants us to consider business dealings as a criteria for holding parliamentary office and managing taxpayers' funds in New South Wales, then let us look at Tony Packard. Do you remember Tony Packard? He was a car salesman found guilty of illegally using listening devices to spy on his customers in order to line his own pocket. The recent actions of Chris Downy's staff member would lead one to think that the Liberal Party is actually running a course on how to intercept telephone conversations and how to threaten and abuse people over the telephone. What did Packard do? He resigned in disgrace after being convicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you remember Matt Singleton, a National Party minister who was kicked out of the ministry in New South Wales because of a conflict of interest between his personal dealings and his public responsibilities as a minister? What was that conflict of interest over? You guessed it: property development. Yet Senator Baume has the hide to come in here and attack the New South Wales Labor Party. With the record that the current New South Wales government has in respect of ministerial propriety and in respect of looking after and managing the taxpayers' funds of New South Wales, Senator Baume should be ashamed of himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can go on. Remember Neil Pickard? He knew how to manage taxpayers' money; he knew how to spend it on himself. When he was Agent General in London he lived the life of luxury and had to go off to the continent occasionally for a bit of R&amp;R all at the taxpayers' expense. Finally Premier Fahey was forced to take the step of sacking him as the Agent General. But he could not get that right; he could not even sack his own representative the right way. He bungled it so badly that Neil Pickard ended up with $400,000 of New South Wales taxpayers' money as compensation because of the Premier's own incompetence.

And you try to lecture us about managing taxpayers' money! What happened to Joe Schipp? Premier Fahey ultimately had to get rid of him for incompetence. Premier Fahey should apply the same standards to himself and resign over his own incompetence when, as the Minister for Industrial Relations, he was in charge of the state superannuation board of New South Wales and was responsible for a loss of $1 billion in property investments&mdash;$1 billion of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on. It is a long list. Terry Griffiths, a Minister for Police charged with upholding the law, had to resign. Barry Morris was kicked out of the Liberal Party. He lost his endorsement as a Liberal candidate because of activities once again associated with the telephone. As I have already mentioned, the latest one was only a couple of days ago. A member of the minister for sports staff used the phone to terrorise and threaten ordinary decent citizens because they had the temerity to support the Labor Party. He used taxpayers' funds for that activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, we are happy to debate this because what we can demonstrate and have demonstrated is how the coalition in New South Wales has flogged off the taxpayer's properties.

<PARA>I have much pleasure in moving this motion because of the widespread concern in the wine industry, particularly amongst the wine grape growers of Australia, due to some of the recommendations in the report of that committee of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is of great concern to the constituents of my own state of South Australia and also those of New South Wales in particular because between them those two states produce some 80 per cent of the grapes grown in Australia. Although other states contribute greatly towards the wine grape production and the wine industry in Australia, 51 per cent is grown in South Australia and 29 per cent is grown in New South Wales. I know the people in the industry in those two states are particularly concerned at the ramifications of any adoption of some of the recommendations in this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As background, the Senate ought to know the place of the wine industry in Australia. Currently, there are some 68,000 hectares of Australia under vines; including something like 3,500 different establishments with a gross value of production of some $530 million; and the industry employs something like 5,000 people throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of even more importance and concern to those grape growers is the fact that this government has followed a policy of increasing taxation on any industry which shows some signs of being successful. So there is great concern in the industry that it has at last managed to show some signs of success. It is fair to say that that industry is probably the only bright light in the rural economy. The industry is concerned that the recommendations of this inquiry would see an increase in taxation which would make it far more difficult for grape growers to continue on the successful path they have been on over the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note that wine grape production has risen from 330,000 tonnes in the early 1970s to over 770,000 tonnes in 1993-94. That is in spite of the fact that in the early 1980s there was a vine-pull program because the industry was in such a state that it was in danger of becoming non-viable. Throughout Australia there are some 800 wineries, mainly small businesses and mostly owner-operated. Seven large companies produce 75 per cent of Australia's wine but there are 600 businesses which produce around two per cent of all the wine. It is important that we make sure that the smaller businesses, which are producing only two per cent of the wine, remain viable because of the employment they provide and because they have now reached the stage of just being able to stand on their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee of inquiry, amongst its recommendations, suggested that wine be subject to a composite tax, comprising an ad valorem wholesale tax and a volumetric tax based on alcohol content. It said the ad valorem component should be adjusted in accordance with any future adjustments to the general rate of wholesale tax and that the volumetric component be indexed to the consumer price index and be levied on wholesale sales in conjunction with the wholesale sales tax, not as an excise on production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any increase in the tax burden on the wine industry will represent a disaster for what has been one of the few bright lights in the rural economy, particularly over recent years. The regionally dispersed nature of the wine industry makes it a leading contributor to regional economies and its technological skill requirements and connection with urban and international markets makes it a contributor of expertise and business leadership that otherwise would be impossible to sustain in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The structural shifts towards wine and wine consumption have been influenced by several factors. Amongst those factors are a change in diet towards Mediterranean and Asian food styles, reflecting both climate and health considerations; the increased dining out which is taking place today and a consequent shift in beverage choice; the increased consciousness of health issues leading towards a shift to fruit juices, flavoured milk and mineral and spring water, and away from alcoholic beverages in general&mdash;but with the health benefits of moderate wine consumption being recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The road safety programs have led to a reduction in alcohol consumption. In my state of South Australia there used to be early closing and the 6 o'clock swill. It was certainly not what would be considered today to be a civilised attitude towards drinking patterns. There has been a reduction in alcohol consumption and a shift towards a moderate consumption with food; and a reduction of what we would always have called sessional drinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also takes into account the changing role of women in society. We all accept that changing role with the economic and social dependence increasing the acceptability of women consuming alcohol which was not the case some time ago. We are pleased that that is also a change that has taken place and one which is generally accepted in our society. It is interesting to note the committee's conclusions as to whether wine is a luxury good or not. The report states in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some might argue that wine is a luxury characterised by occasional and discretionary purchasing patterns, being relatively price inelastic and having a relatively high income elasticity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is probable that a disaggregated analysis of wine consumption would establish that ultra-premium wine demonstrates many of the characteristics of a luxury. However, Mr Crosser and Professor Freebairn have elected to apply their taxation recommendations to all wine in a uniform fashion and therefore it is appropriate to measure wine's behaviour in aggregate fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wine is consumed uniformly across all age groups with the exception of the very young (18-24 years), both sexes, and comprises approximately the same proportion of household expenditure across all income groups (0.4 to 0.5 per cent), with the exception that it is a higher proportion of the lowest income quintile (0.87 per cent). The generally uniformed proportion of income spent on wines shows it is popular across all income groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no evidence that wine has an income elasticity of greater than one, while there is considerable demographic empirical evidence that wine has become an increasingly significant everyday component of Australian lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Mr Crosser and Professor Freebairn's judgment, wine in aggregate does not exhibit the luxury good behaviour of electronic goods, jewellery, leather goods or luxury cars which are taxed for revenue at 31 to 45 per cent of WST.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also worth noting that many real luxuries such as fashion clothing and gourmet meals are not taxed at all. The WST system is very inconsistent in its treatment of luxury items, demonstrating a lack of determination to target obvious luxury goods.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian wine is internationally competitive because of both its natural and man made advantages. We have in Australia the right environment, the right heritage of viticulture and winemaking, the right technological resources, the right scope for innovation, the right human resources, the right industry structure, the right amount of diversity and the right market signals. All of those things combined have over the past few years given us a very internationally competitive place in that market and one which cannot bear tampering with if the recommendations of this report or some of the recommendations to increase taxes in this report are adopted by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee of inquiry recommends a specific tax on alcohol content to apply to wine to bring wine into line with other alcoholic products and to help offset costs associated with alcohol abuse. This argument ignores some very basic facts. For one thing, it is based on the premise that the current tax on other forms of alcohol&mdash;beer and spirits&mdash;is at the right level. I would question whether that basic premise is right at all. It also ignores that in both the production and consumption of wine, which I will outline shortly, there are some very basic differences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would first like to point out that at least part of this argument has the support of the Australian Democrats whose leader, Senator Kernot, in this place on 30 August 1993, when the increase in wine tax was being debated after the 1993 budget, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There may be a case for increasing the tax rate on wine to bring it more into line with other alcoholic beverages such as beer, but not at the expense of the viability of an increasingly export oriented industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The later part of these remarks would suggest that Senator Kernot may have been well intentioned in her position, however, she missed the point that comparing the wine industry with the beer industry is like comparing apples with oranges. She also missed the point that any tax increase in wine would have a significant effect on the Australian wine industry's attempts to compete on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us talk about some of the wine production differences. For a start, you only get a grape crop once a year. It is subject to seasonal variations, so it is totally different and totally unlike other forms of alcohol production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investments made in vineyards are locked in over a period of time. Decisions made four years ago are now starting to bear fruit and over the next couple of years some return on that investment will start to be realised. But once the investment is made, it is locked in. As this investment has already been made under a certain set of rules, to change the taxation arrangements later has a tremendously adverse effect on that investment, particularly in the wine industry. There is a three- and four-year lead time to expand grape supply, the annual utilisation of the winery processing equipment is limited to some three or four months, the time to market for quality bottled wine is one to three years and there is a high degree of value adding. There is value adding seven times in wine production. There is an extent of vertical integration, and human skill, judgment and creativity are required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention the differences between the consumption of wine and the consumption of other alcoholic beverages. Demographically, wine tends to be consumed by an older age group of people and by a higher proportion of females. The place of consumption has a great effect on our social lives and impacts on society. The interesting thing is that the main place for wine consumption is either the home or the restaurant. In many cases, I think wine adds to the quality of life in our society because of its place of consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the occasion of consumption, over 80 per cent of wine consumed is consumed with food or with a meal. This certainly has a health benefit and certainly leads to fewer social problems, particularly with regard to drink driving and other things of that nature. Then there is beverage choice behaviour. If people in that environment are not drinking wine, they prefer non-alcoholic alternatives. Overall, these patterns show moderate consumption of wine. That has been proved over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will talk briefly about the wine industry because I know that my colleagues have contributions they want to make. The wine industry in Australia has been very successful. It has successfully, and perhaps uniquely, combined market responsiveness with quality focus, value adding, technological sophistication and social responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one of the reasons there is a recommendation to increase the taxes on wines is to offset the cost of treatment of alcohol abuse, I think it does not take into account the fact that the wine industry, above all others, has been very conscious of consumption behaviour. Although there will always be extremes and there will always be people who abuse alcohol, the moderate consumption patterns of wine have led the wine industry to be a very responsible one. It has been very socially responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also foresee a problem in the timing of this report. In 1995 the wine industry is suffering some adversity. It looks like there will be a 200,000 tonne loss of grapes from the 1995 vintage due to drought and cost increases from higher grape prices. There is an increase in the wholesale sales tax anyway from 24 per cent to 26 per cent in July and a two per cent or more interest rate rise adds to the cost and the working capital requirements of holding wine stocks for maturation. There is also a fall in domestic wine sales of some 1.6 per cent for 1994, including a 2.4 per cent fall in cask wine for the 12 months to January 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been widespread concern. The reason I have raised this issue in the Senate this week is that I think the wine industry, and particularly the wine grape growers, who are my particular concern, needs to have some of those worries alleviated by the government rejecting both the majority and minority report recommendations for an increase in wine taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems as though this government is prepared to tax anything that moves and it seems to be also taxing lots of things that do not move. The current uncertainty brought about by the release of this report can be alleviated by the government announcing that it will reject both the majority and minority report with regard to increases in wine taxes. It will take away the uncertainty in the industry and it will reinstate investment confidence. The wine industry is one that currently has a lot of positive investment and these investments are being made in the long term. They need to be made with the investors having the certainty that they will be under the same rules they thought they were going to be under when they made that initial investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a particular concern for the grape growers, which is the same concern I have always had for primary producers. The grape growers, who are primary producers, are price takers and not price setters. All of the difficulties we have seen in primary industries over the past few years are due to the fact that the primary producers have no control over the amount they receive for the goods they produce. Regardless of the cost of production, they take only what the market offers. But, because it value adds, the wine industry can be a price setter. It can reclaim its costs. It can make sure that it sells its product at a profit while the grape growers cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the grape growers are undergoing a boom. Although production is down significantly this year&mdash;by up to 40 per cent in some places in the Barossa Valley&mdash;the increase in prices means that the growers are remaining viable and are going through good times. I remember a time, not so very long ago, particularly in the vine-pull era, when they were struggling just to hang on to their properties. I therefore urge this government to reject the recommendations of this commission of inquiry for an increase in taxes so that this industry, which has a target of $1 billion of exports by the year 2000, is allowed to get on with its job without any impediments. </PARA>

Our wine industry is one of Australia's success stories. It is most appropriate that the draft report of the committee of inquiry into the wine grape industry in Australia be debated at this time and over the next few months as the final report is being prepared. The issue will be open to further comment when the second round of hearings begin in a few months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reading through the notice of motion before the Senate this afternoon, I was concerned that only the tax issue was being emphasised. When I look at the very last section of it I see that we are being asked, prematurely, to urge the government to reject part of what is only an interim report. By all means, senators should be free to express opposition to it&mdash;I will be talking about the Australian Democrats' opposition in just a moment&mdash;but I do not believe that it is appropriate, when a report is in a draft form, has not been presented to government and the government has not responded, that we should start urging the government to reject certain sections of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the recommendations will not be acted upon in this year's budget because the government does not yet have the final report. We are not expecting to see any changes in this year's budget as a result of anything that might be in this interim report. It is fine for us to express our opposition here today, but we must look at the specifics of the motion. For example, I note that part (a) section (ii) refers to the Australian Democrats and the fact that we favour tax increases over expenditure cuts as a means of deficit reduction. The Democrats are happy to say that we favour a fair and adequate tax system rather than ongoing expenditure cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note here some comments made in this chamber yesterday by Senator Gibson and Senator Abetz about what is happening in New Zealand, and praising the New Zealand economy. The Industry Commission would have been happy with that debate; it was all about numbers and economic indicators with absolutely nothing about people. Senator Abetz said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have heard here today, so ably set out by Senator Gibson, that New Zealand is now truly bringing home the bacon . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the senator what that means for people and what effect the policies of that government have on individual New Zealanders. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 28 March, titled `NZ's forgotten children', the New Zealand Commissioner for Children, Laurie O'Reilly, says:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Salvation Army figures show that the number of people it provided with food parcels nearly quadrupled from 2124 in the first quarter of 1991, before major benefits cuts of up to 25%, to 10,261 in the same period the following year. In the first three months of 1994, it topped 14,900.</PARA>
<PARA>That is just a small sample of what is happening to people in New Zealand. If we look further in this motion, after some comments about the wine industry itself and various characteristics of it we see there are some comments on the recent draft report, which is really what we are talking about today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to go back in history a little bit and look at how this inquiry came about. The Democrats insisted upon this inquiry as part of the compromise package negotiated after the 1993 budget. As I said at the time, the Democrats wanted to see an industry plan developed&mdash;that is, a plan for the wine industry that would enable the development of a comprehensive package for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will continue to oppose any increase in tax on wine unless any such rise can be demonstrated as an acceptable and integral part of an industry plan. I do not believe that anything I have read in this draft report supports the minority view of Mr Scales that any tax increases for the wine industry can be justified. The Democrat stance remains consistent, and we look forward to seeing further justification by Mr Scales in the final report because he is a long way from proving his case that there is a need for any increases. We were opposed to the involvement of the Industry Commission in this inquiry in the first place. On 7 October 1993, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's offer that the Industry Commission can conduct a study is unacceptable to the Democrats. In its current form the commission, with it entrenched ideological bias towards extreme economic rationalism, is not going to be the way to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA>All I will say now is that what we were concerned about has actually happened. The stamp of the Industry Commission goes far further than Mr Scales's minority report as far as the taxes are concerned. I hate to do it but I really cannot resist the temptation to say to the industry, `We told you so.' The outcome it wanted may be a long way from happening following the involvement of the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I believe it is far too early to actually be asking the government to reject any parts of this report. We still have several months of negotiations, discussions and hearings to go. To debate the merits or otherwise of this draft report is certainly appropriate. Hopefully, what we are also doing as members of this place is encouraging grape growers, wine makers, those involved in this industry&mdash;particularly those employed in the industry&mdash;regional tourist authorities, wine companies, regional development authorities and those interested in the future of the Murray-Darling Basin to get involved, give an input and express their concerns, if they have any, about this draft report. They can do that either by written response or, as they have been invited to do in this report, by participating in the next round of hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now look specifically at the tax issues. The Democrats do not believe that there is any case presented in the draft report that supports the minority view. However, we congratulate the majority finding, which is based on evidence, that a shift towards a volumetric tax is to be recommended. The industry has in the past acknowledged that, for some people, the consumption of wine is a health hazard. The industry has used its own resources to contribute to the national harm minimisation goals by, for example, introducing clear indicators on wine containers and bottles that show how many glasses or standard drinks are in each container. That is something that the alcohol industry has finally recognised and will adopt generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has also realised that telling men and women how many standard drinks per day is safe is only part of the solution. People must then be able to judge what a standard drink is. I see the recommendation of the inquiry as an extension of this commitment to harm minimisation. The industry has acknowledged that its product can be misused and, indeed, is misused and that it must contribute to the results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now outline the major problem. While I believe the industry has been doing what it should be doing in this area, the government certainly has not. I draw the attention of the Senate to a recent report of the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drugs, Money and Government</EMPHASIS>. This report looks at the amount of money collected by government through wine taxes, alcohol taxes and tobacco taxes. It then looks at the actual expenditure that government makes on various drug and alcohol programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see from the executive summary of that report that it has been conservatively estimated that drug abuse actually costs the community more than $14.3 billion each year. When we look at these statistics we find that very little is actually made up by government in terms of government expenditure. Government collects vast amounts of revenue from both alcohol and tobacco taxes. This varies from state to state, but obviously the Commonwealth adds to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actual proportion of this revenue that is then put back into drug and alcohol programs is minuscule. Page 7 of this report refers to revenue and indicates that the Commonwealth raised $3.8 billion from these taxes, but actually only returned one per cent of that to drug programs. Funding per head of population amounts to only $2.06. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will be very cautious about even moving in the direction that the majority recommends until we see some evidence that the government is actually going to put that money towards the drug and alcohol programs that it is supposedly collecting that money for. One of the recommendations of ADCA is that governments must make more money available for prevention, research, education, intervention and treatment of drug related problems. The amount of money being spent has to be increased and has to be sustained. Therefore, the Democrats will be very reluctant to support a shift to a composite tax until such time as we see the federal government expenditure on these programs significantly increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I will mention a few other concerns the Democrats have. Again I go back to the emphasis on tax which we have seen in the media generally and in this place today. This is overshadowing a huge number of other recommendations in this report, some of which are very positive. If we look at the recommendations in this report relating to tax, we find that they account for only nine out of 38. I again ask those members interested in the industry to read further and to get involved in the other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern to the Democrats is chapter 7, on irrigation and water issues. While we agree that there should be price incentives for water efficiency and adjustment towards that, and penalties for contributing to river salinity, there are no recommendations in here that tell us how we get from where we are now to where the industry eventually has to be. We need to look at a variety of solutions rather than just the broad brush approach of charging full price for water and freeing up licences by open auction. Again I see this section as being heavily influenced by the economic rationalists in the Industry Commission. The Democrats will be looking at putting in a full response to this section of the report and other sections. I hope that the Liberal Party will also be putting its comments in writing to the committee as the debate continues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this motion moved by my colleague Senator Ferguson. It is very sad that 18 months after the last wine sales tax debacle we are lining up yet again for another tax impost on one of the most successful industries in Australia. We debated this issue extremely thoroughly 18 months ago. We had the Democrats initially supporting us on this issue, quite correctly, but they eventually went to water under pressure from the government. I ask them to consider what they did last time, to consider the people in the regional areas in one of our most successful industries and to support the growth of the industry by stopping this tax which will kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a habit of doing finding a growth industry and taxing it to death. The government should realise that it will end up with greater revenue in the long run if it leaves these taxes off. Last time the government proposed an increase in the sales tax on wine from 20 to 32 per cent first up&mdash;a massive 55 per cent increase in one hit. An industry with the potential of $1 billion a year in export income by year 2000 would have been cut off at the knees if that measure had gone ahead then. There would have been a permanent loss of jobs in the wine industry of 45 per cent at a time when the country had 800,000 people unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the government is proposing further increases in sales taxes, which will have exactly the same effect&mdash;to cut jobs. Not only will it cut jobs; it will cut investment. You do not plant a grape vine, harvest it a few weeks later, produce a bottle of wine and sell it a few weeks later. This is a long-term process. If twice in 18 months the government proposes to put up taxes, what is the effect on business people who are thinking about money invested and returns seven, eight, or nine years out? I will tell the government the effect: they do not invest. If you look at the total effect of what you are doing in the long-term, you might get more marginal revenue from increasing taxes now, but 10 years down the track you will be taking in a lot less industry and you will have created a lot more unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor does not seem to have learnt from this debacle. It is right that we raise these issues now. The Democrats' representative Senator Lees said: `Why are you bringing this up now? This is only an interim report.' We want to create a groundswell in the community, starting to protest long and loud before it is a fait accompli on budget night, that they do not want increases in taxes on wine, that they do not want tax increases that will destroy jobs, that they do not want tax increases that will destroy our already weak and fragile rural and regional infrastructure. Why kill one of our best industries? The government is proposing just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that due to the complicity of the Democrats 18 months ago the government managed to get through some increases&mdash;not the huge increases it originally proposed,  but a graduated sales tax increase to 26 per cent from 21 per cent originally on 1 July this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package that was brought in at that point included some concessions on depreciation rates and grants for export wine promotion. A national inquiry into the wine industry was also announced. That is why we have this problem today, because that inquiry, headed by Bill Scales of the Industry Commission, has been taking evidence since mid-1994 and has now come down with a very alarming interim report. There will be further public comment until the final report goes to the government in June 1995. That is why, unlike what the Democrats have suggested this afternoon, we are saying that the public, particularly regional and rural Australia, which has been dudded again by this government, should be protesting that the government is trying to kill off yet another successful industry with these tax measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already, across the wine industry and the grape growing industry, alarm bells have been ringing about the two main options put forward in this report. Let us look at the options that this report is suggesting. In the draft report, the commissioners were unable to agree on the amount of tax that should be paid on Australian wine at the wholesale level. There was agreement on the format that the indirect tax on wine should take. Instead of the present straight sales tax mechanism, it was recommended that the industry should pay a rate of sales tax plus a volumetric tax to be set at $4 a litre of alcohol. This option is a disaster for the wine industry. The majority of the commissioners opted for a wholesale sales tax of 10 per cent plus the volumetric tax of $4 a litre of alcohol to be phased in between now and 1998. The impact of this measure has been set out starkly by Hunter Valley vigneron Bruce Tyrrell in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> today. Under the first option the price of a wine cask would increase by $1.50. Also, wines which currently sell for about $5 or less would become more expensive and those over $5 would be cheaper. Clearly, the increase in price at the cheaper end of the market and the wine cask would have the effect of putting wine outside the reach of low income earners. The price increase would take the marginal drinker back to beer, which has received a reduction in tax for lower alcohol products. Where is the logic in curtailing the growing wine industry with tax policies which would benefit the foreign-owned brewing industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second tax option in this report is more horrendous for the wine industry. It would see sales tax go up to 32 per cent, plus a $4 volumetric tax. A $10 bottle of wine would increase by $1&mdash;a 10 per cent increase, which is way out of line with inflation, quite obviously&mdash;and a wine cask would increase by $3. Bruce Tyrrell from the Hunter Valley, whom I mentioned earlier, claims that this second option would see domestic sales decline by up to 20 per cent immediately. It is disgraceful, when we are trying to get growth in exports, that the government would even consider a proposal like this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate is timely in order to lay out the options that this Labor government has waiting for the Australian wine industry. Budget decisions based on either or a mix of these recommendations would show that the ALP has no regard for the industry and the employment potential for rural and regional Australia. The marginal seats in the next federal election, including Paterson and Hunter in New South Wales and McEwen in Victoria, will be waiting to pass judgment on this issue. I am sure my colleague Senator Troeth will have something to say about that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian wine industry, like its vines, must be nurtured with care. Tax policies such as those being proposed could destroy the industry very quickly. There is already a noticeable decline, because of the tax measures which the government has introduced over the last 18 months, in the rate of growth of our wine exports. An inappropriate and harsh tax policy could totally cripple this industry and leave an oversupply of wine from when recent plantings begin producing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry, consumers and regional Australia await with dread the outcome of this report and what the government is proposing to do. Today we call on the Australian Democrats not to buckle like they did last time, but to support the wine industry, support rural and regional Australia, support increased growth in exports and support increased growth in our economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am particularly pleased to support the motion of my colleague Senator Ferguson. With regard to Senator Lees's comments that it is rather early in the piece to be having a debate on the wine industry, I point out to her that it would be extremely remiss of responsible senators not to flag the issues involved and talk about them at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate office in Victoria is located next to the federal seat of McEwen, which encompasses one of the best wine producing regions in the country. There are some 50 wineries in the electorate, and they are a typical mix of large industry operations and small family vineyards. A few of these include Mitchelton Wines, the DeBortoli winery, the Delatite winery and the Cleveland winery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any increase in the wine tax, such as is proposed in this report, would have devastating consequences for the wine industry. Seasonal effects of drought and frost are already hurting grape growers badly, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics is forecasting a 50,000 tonne shortfall of grapes in the 1995 vintage, which follows a 30,000 tonne shortfall in the 1994 vintage. Bad weather has imposed cuts in grape yields, which is expected to lift grape prices 20 per cent as it is. Recent drought and frosts have cut yields by between 20 and 30 per cent in some areas. On 10 March this year, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1995 wine grape harvest, hit by drought and other adverse weather, is a disaster that will cost the industry an estimated $500 million and force up prices by an unprecedented 10 to 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the industry is already being harmed by an unfavourable exchange rate. Given these existing factors, this is the worst time to be even considering an extra tax on wine producers. To add insult to injury, this is the third time since the federal government's introduction of a sales tax on wine that an increase in the tax rate has been floated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it is, the current tax system provides little incentive for growers to produce grapes for higher quality wines. As my colleague Senator Tierney pointed out, it takes around seven years to get a bottle of wine on the market. For this to occur effectively, it is essential for planning purposes that winemakers have some certainty in taxation policy. The new tax regime being proposed by the Industry Commission is an attempt to bring the tax on wine into line with that for spirits and beer. Stephen Shelmerdine, the President of the Victorian Wine Industry Association, said that this regime does not:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">reflect the different production base, manufacturing processes, stockholding levels, consumption patterns, regional economic contribution, tourism aspects, investment time frames, export potential and cultural composition.</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed tax changes to wine could net the federal government an extra $200 million per year&mdash;almost double the present tax take from the industry of about $265 million a year. At the extreme end of the proposal, as Senator Tierney outlined, consumers could expect to pay an extra $1 for a $10 bottle of wine and an extra $2.76 for an $8 cask of wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, tax increases have led to a slowing in consumption. In 1986 when sales tax on wine went from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, the Australian wine industry lost 3.9 litres per capita per annum of domestic consumption over a five-year period. That cost the industry $200 million per year in lost sales, 64 million litres per annum of less wine, 90,000 tonnes per annum less grapes from 9,000 hectares of potential vines, 1,000 potential jobs in vineyards and 1,000 potential jobs in wineries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The BRL Hardy Managing Director, Mr Stephen Millar, was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 14 March this year as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is just outrageous to severely disrupt an industry which is earning valuable export dollars, creating tourism, providing jobs, acting as a model for value adding and which has done more than its fair share in promoting alcohol in moderation.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1993, when the government was proposing wine tax increases as part of the budget, I remember the present member for McEwen, Mr Cleeland, making a lot of noise opposing any increases. At the time I was pleasantly surprised that Mr Cleeland should be taking such a concerned position in relation to all the wine producers who would be so badly affected by any increase in tax. Mr Cleeland was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . all we (the Government) have done is penalise wine producers for their efforts by increasing the tax on wine . . . The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have lost sight of the most important economic issue facing the country, the current account deficit, which is not really diminishing at all. They appear to have forgotten that exports are crucial if we are to turn the current account deficit around.</PARA>
<PARA>Those were Mr Cleeland's very words. These comments are somewhat ironic in view of the confirmed increase in the current account deficit in the 20 months since that time. The press release went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Cleeland said it was clear that the economic advice of Treasury was still being followed to the letter despite the fact that Treasury was dangerously out of touch with reality.</PARA>
<PARA>It is somewhat of a first for me to find myself actually endorsing comments by the present member for McEwen. However, Mr Cleeland, despite registering his opposition to the increase in the wine tax in the 1993 budget, still voted for it. It is all very well for Mr Cleeland to get up in the other place and say that he really cares about the people in his electorate, the people who work in those wineries that I detailed at the start of my remarks, but it might have been more beneficial if he had done more than just pay lip service to the sentiments but not take any action to defeat them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be very happy to be corrected, but I have not seen any comments by Mr Cleeland in relation to this most recent proposition to increase wine tax and I wonder why it is that Mr Cleeland has not seen fit to defend his constituents in relation to this issue. In regard to his comments on the current account deficit, which he said, you will remember, is not really diminishing at all, one might have assumed that since he was so concerned with this fact two years ago he must positively be beside himself today with the March figures showing a $2.2 billion current account deficit. Continuing high levels of export wine would play a role in reducing this amount and the wine industry is very typical of the positive attitude that we need to provide exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If our wine is to be really competitive overseas, we must start to come in line with those countries with which we compete. In 1993, Californian wine was taxed at 50c a litre and French wine was taxed at 67c a litre. At that time, if all the 1993 budget hikes had gone through, Australian wine would have been taxed at $1.47 a litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regional nature of wine production, as both my colleagues Senator Tierney and Senator Ferguson remarked, means that whole areas will be hurt by increasing taxes which may lead to a drop in investment or different business arrangements by wine growers. Wine growing is an important source of employment, especially in rural and regional areas. Casual seasonal work provides important additional income for rural families. The work in vineyards and wineries gives rural people and particularly women a chance to make extra income for their families over the 12-month seasonal growing period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given an increase in the wine tax, the negative effects on employment give lie to the government's reputed concern about the number of jobless Australians, particularly in rural and regional areas. I conclude by reiterating in the strongest sense my opposition to any increase in the wine tax. A further tax on wine is a tax on exports and is a direct deterrent to future investment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go on, I want to reflect upon Senator Lees's quite extraordinary intervention into this debate with the matter of New Zealand. None of us could quite work out its relevance to this debate about the Australian wine industry. For some reason, she departed from the issue to discuss New Zealand and again exhibited the Australian Democrats' unbelievable ignorance of economics. Clearly, these people are the great economic irrationalists of Australia. They hate free markets and do not understand that good economic performance means good outcomes for people. They keep insisting that those who talk numbers are not talking people, which simply reflects their incredible ignorance of how one gets good outcomes for people. </PARA>

The impact will be particularly devastating there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on the record how important the wine industry is to the state of South Australia. Many people are ignorant of the fact that South Australia, which is a relatively small state, nevertheless accounts for 51 per cent of total national wine production. It accounts for 48 per cent of total employment in the wine industry. About 2,500 people are directly employed in South Australia in the wine industry. South Australia is responsible for no less than 65 per cent of all wine exported from Australia. Wine produced in South Australia represents seven per cent of the value of South Australian exports. Clearly, this industry is vital to the state of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I balance that position by referring to the economic position of South Australia, which remains very fragile.

On the face of it, the national growth figures are reasonably good following the devastation of the recession. But these overall figures disguise what is really going on in Australia. The fact is that, under Labor, Australia has become two nations. It is no longer one nation. It is severely divided into two countries. Queensland and Western Australia are growing very much faster than the rest of Australia. Those two states form one nation, while the rest fall a long way behind.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of Labor governments, as he should well know. Growth in the year to September 1994 nationally was 6.3 per cent. But it disguises this very important point, which Senator Sherry insists on ignoring. In Western Australia, growth was 10.1 per cent, and in Queensland it was 9.4 per cent. Look at the other states. South Australia had only 1.7 per cent in the year to September 1994, which covered the tail end of that disastrous Labor government. Tasmania had only 0.1 per cent growth.

Tragically, the federal government seems to be completely indifferent to this very important fact. It continues to talk in the dream world of one national economy when, quite clearly from these figures, there is no national economy. The difference between Tasmania's economic growth of 0.1 per cent and Western Australia's 10.1 per cent in the year to September 1994 is quite alarming and represents a massive difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Terry McCrann wrote a very good article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 11-12 February, which I commend to everybody, particularly the government, about this problem of having two nations. In particular, he described the facts as I have put them and then went on to explain why he believes this federal Labor government is so indifferent to this fact and governing as though this fact did not exist.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem for regional economies like South Australia and Tasmania is particularly highlighted in the deliberate government policy of high interest rates aimed at restraining growth, which on the face of it appears high, for the national economy as a whole. But South Australia is only growing at 1.7 per cent and Tasmania at 0.1 per cent. These economies are hardly overheating; they are hardly in need of a high interest rate policy to contain growth. It shows how ludicrous the government's macro-economic policy really is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So you do have a very fragile South Australian economy that is growing at only 1.7 per cent after all those years of inept, incompetent Labor government. Any further increase in the tax on the wine industry&mdash;an industry which is so vital to South Australia&mdash;would have a particularly devastating effect in that state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will describe some of those effects. The South Australian Development Council estimated that if the recommendations in the minority report by Mr Bill Scales were introduced, they would result in the loss of 8,000 hectares in new plantings of grapes and a loss of over 1,000 jobs in South Australia alone. Just this week in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, Southcorp Wines revealed that it is seriously considering placing on hold $15 million worth of vineyard investment because of its concerns with this draft report of the wine industry inquiry. So the situation is quite serious: if this report were implemented, it would have a huge impact in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, what worries us on this side is the contempt which Labor has consistently shown for South Australia. The Labor government was responsible for the $3,000 million lost by the State Bank in South Australia&mdash;the biggest corporate loss in Australian history and one which South Australians will be repaying and my nine- and four-year-old children will be repaying for the rest of their lives. The wine tax, which most impacts on South Australia, has already been increased by this government by nearly one-third in the last two years. The rate will have gone from 20 per cent to 26 per cent by July this year. So we have already had a one-third increase in tax. We do not need any more tax increases. I urge the government to reject completely this proposal for any further increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most particularly, I hope the government will reject the proposal for what amounts to an additional tax levied on the alcohol content. That is the killer disguised in this report&mdash;the introduction of a new tax on wine.

I did not follow the argument of Senator Lees, who suggested that the wine industry, the tourist industry and all these other groups should respond to the draft report but that the Senate ought not have a say. It seems to me to be totally appropriate for us to express this afternoon our views on the impact these recommendations would have on the businesses and industries in our electorates. I urge the government to make it quite plain, right now, that there will be no further increase in tax on the wine industry. The committee can then get on with drafting its final report and recommendations, hearing loudly and clearly what the views are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A dramatic increase in tax, as this report recommends, would have a great impact on the small wineries; and the wineries in the Canberra region are all small. The impact on them would be much greater than would be a similar increase in tax on the larger wineries. If we are to do anything to help the smaller wineries and make them more attractive as small businesses and as part of a tourist industry, we should take away the sales tax on cellar door sales&mdash;or something of that nature to give them an opportunity to succeed. To increase exports to try to achieve the target of $1 billion by the year 2000 would entail considerable investment in the wine industry. It can be achieved only if there is a stable domestic market and that has to be the basis of any export market. No industry can maintain a strong export effort without a strong and stable domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales already indicate some decline, and that decline will only steepen if another tax is placed upon wine at the present time. Export growth must have continued investment, but wine growers and winemakers are not going to be able to put money into investing further to meet the year 2000 target if they are going to be hit so hard by the additional taxes recommended in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the smaller wineries and the tourism that so often goes with the smaller wineries which will be affected. The impact will not just be on the wineries themselves, on the restaurants and the other tourism industries in their vicinity. It really is a most extraordinary thing that for an industry like this, which really has been doing quite well, is growing, export markets are growing, overseas acceptance and liking of Australian wines is obviously increasing, anyone could contemplate a course of action which would interfere with that. It really defies imagination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wineries in the ACT district are ones which would be, like other small wineries, particularly affected. We do not need this sort of thing. I will not go into detail as Senator Ferguson has done. As I said, I will keep my remarks in time consistent with the size of the industry in my electorate. I support wholeheartedly the motion put forward by Senator Ferguson. I hope all of the Senate will adopt that approach and tell the committee inquiring into the industry that it is on the wrong tram. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the suggestions, proposals and recommendations that were made by the inquiry into the wine industry. In some contrast to Senator Reid's position, the wine industry is indeed an extremely important and extensive one in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The turnover per annum in the 1992-93 year was $285 million. Victoria does represent some 20 per cent of national wine production and it is at the level of 100 million litres of wine. In 1993 there were over 1,800 establishments involved in viticulture. Traditionally, and perhaps still most importantly, along the Murray approximately 1,600 establishments are concentrated, reaching down into the Mallee. Sunraysia is the second biggest producing region after the Riverland in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is of course growing and spreading right across the whole state. Vineyards have been established in the far south-west in the Hamilton-Portland area; the Otways, including around Geelong and Werribee; western Victoria, the Grampians and the Pyrenees where some excellent high quality wines are now produced; central Victoria, Bendigo-Heathcote and Macedon; Gippsland, Bairnsdale and Leongatha; the north east, the King and Oven Valleys; the Mornington Peninsula near Dromana and Merricks; and of course the Yarra Valley regions close to Melbourne. Perhaps the most famous of them all is the Rutherglen area where one of the world's acknowledged best wines in the so-called stickies, the dessert wines, the muscats, the ports, the tokays, the frontignacs are produced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry is an extremely important industry for Victoria. This is also reflected in the employment that it provides. Several thousand jobs depend on it directly and the estimated multiplier of at least two&mdash;I would suggest three&mdash;extends it into the industries of tourism and generally the hospitality industry which, to a large extent, is now intertwined with the wine industry in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consumer, I happily acknowledge, but more importantly as a proud promoter&mdash;whenever I have visitors from overseas, I make sure they get to know first hand the wine industry in Victoria&mdash;and, of course, as the Democrat spokesperson on industry and regional development, my personal view is that the recommendations made by Mr Bill Scales for an effective increase in wine taxation should be rejected firmly and categorically. I know that the process is not completed and I know that it may be said that it is a little premature for us to be doing that, but that certainly is my strong reaction from my first-hand knowledge of the wine industry, which is primarily based on my contacts and my direct experience in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two specific reasons I make that statement. I think the concept of avoiding tax distortions between products is fine as a textbook, economic, theoretical approach, but this approach fails to take account of community impacts of what people like Mr Scales like to call `industry adjustment'. There is a big difference between levying an industry which is marketing a mass product throughout the nation, such as the beer industry, and belting an industry which is located in pockets of geographic concentration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the knock-on effects of adjustment for grape downs supporting non-premium wine might be significant both economically and socially. Bold economic assessments of avoiding relative economic price distortions do not take into account these sorts of community impacts which we will get and which people who live in those areas will experience. I believe it is the human, economic and social aspects of these changes and these recommendations that the government, the parliament and this chamber must take into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pick out just one other aspect of the recommendations made; that is, more funding is required for viticulture courses in country TAFE colleges. Of course, that is a recommendation that we must support; however, the Industry Commission representative then seems to argue that since the wine industry will benefit, the wine industry should pay. My concept of education is that it is a function of government, that it is provided to the community by government out of taxes raised. If we enter into a situation where we say that people must pay for education, we are entering a period of inequality because education offers opportunity for employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we say, `You cannot have education, you cannot have training,' be it for general education or for a specific TAFE based training course, then we are saying, `If you are disadvantaged you will remain disadvantaged because you will only get that education or that training if you can pay for it.' It seems to me that we must take a very strong stand on this issue and realise that if we are going to further the wine industry for Victoria's sake, for Australia's sake and for the whole community's sake, then we must be prepared to foot the bill as a community for further education and training that is required for that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other angles that I want to cover that affect Victoria in particular. It is clear that the tax proposals in the Industry Commission report, particularly the Scales proposal, will hit growers of non-premium wine grapes harvest, yet two major Victorian grape producing regions, Sunraysia and Kerang-Swan Hill, produce a high proportion of non-premium wine grapes. What is passed off as a minor industry adjustment by Mr Scales could have a significant negative effect on those regions and the communities that live there. It is worth mentioning that one of those regions, Sunraysia, was belted recently with the damage done to its citrus industry by the recent tax changes on orange juice following the WTO bills that went through the Senate before Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no understanding in Mr Scales's concept that many towns in country Australia have their entire economies relying on one or two industries. Sunraysia is heavily dependent on both its citrus industry and its grape growers. To attack both of these industries in the space of a few months sends a pretty clear message to the people of Sunraysia about how much economic fundamentalists in Canberra care about them. It is a concept that we must resist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Scales's main argument seems to be that there is some substitution between beer and wine; therefore, they should be treated the same. That is not the point. The point is that the tax levy should be covering the cost to the community of alcoholism, health care, public disorder, car accidents, and so on. As pointed out by my colleague Senator Lees, no case is made that wine is responsible for anywhere near as much damage to the community as beer. Certainly, casual observation would suggest it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully, the report that the Senate is debating this afternoon is not the end of the story. This is only a draft report. There are still several months of public hearings and consultations to go before the report is finalised and written submissions can still be put. I know that wine growers and people engaged in the viticulture industry have already been put to a fair amount of effort and expense in providing their submissions, but at least there is the consolation that we can continue with our efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would invite Victorian wine growers in particular to make their views known yet again to the inquiry. They should comment on any or all of the draft proposals that have been submitted so far, even on matters that have not been covered by the recommendations.The next round of public hearings starts in Melbourne on 26 April. I suggest that industry leaders bury Mr Scales's fundamentalist proposals under the weight of continued submissions. The Australian Democrats will certainly be there to put across the need for fairness and a real commitment to the future of the wine industry and the communities that depend on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler obviously did not listen to what Senator Lees said. At least Senator Spindler rejected outright Mr Scales's proposals and recommendations in this draft report, although he did say that some would argue that it is premature to comment on a draft report. However, he came to the conclusion that it was appropriate for us to make the point that these recommendations should be rejected because, given that it is a draft report, this is the very time that the public, and we as their representatives in this parliament, should be making known our stand against these particular proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in the debate, it was disappointing to see that Senator Lees did not stand up at all for her home state of South Australia. In contrast to what Senator Spindler said, she said it was not an appropriate time for us to be publicly putting arguments against the draft report. As I said a moment ago, that is absolute nonsense. It seems that Senator Lees was trying to have two bob each way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a draft report and, because of its very nature, this is the time when public comment ought to be made by people involved in the industry, by members of the public who have an interest in this industry and, most importantly, by us in this place who represent them in the parliament. I am disappointed that Senator Lees has not joined those of us in the Liberal and National parties today who are supporting strongly this motion put forward by my South Australian colleague Senator Ferguson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that at least Senator Spindler, in contrast to Senator Lees, has rejected the Scales recommendations out of hand. Even Senator Spindler did not make any comment about the majority recommendations in that draft report. I would be very interested to know where Senator Spindler stands on those particular recommendations because we also oppose those proposals, as does the overwhelming majority of people involved in this very important industry. At least Senator Spindler came part way down the track towards supporting what we are about today. But in our view, as senators representing the Liberal and National parties and senators concerned about this really important industry, he really did not come the full way, as we would have liked, and reject absolutely all the aspects of this report that deal with changes to the tax structure for the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could I also comment on what Senator Spindler said about economic fundamentalists. He said that the changes being made in tax to the wine industry, and also to the citrus industry, have recently showed the citrus and grape growers in the Sunraysia what the economic fundamentalists in Canberra think of them. I put it to Senator Spindler that this has absolutely nothing to do with economic fundamentalism, whatever that might mean. In many respects, so-called economic fundamentalism has been made a straw man and blamed for all sorts of ills in this country over the last few years. This current proposal for tax increases, the earlier tax increases on the wine industry and, indeed, the tax increases on the citrus industry have nothing to do whatsoever with economic fundamentalism; they have everything to do with a rapacious government that needs more and more revenue to fund its extravagant spending programs because of its inability to bring discipline to its fiscal program. That is what this issue is about. It has nothing whatsoever to do with economic fundamentalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of this issue was demonstrated today by the large number of people who have spoken and who are still to speak in this debate in support of the motion moved by my colleague Senator Ferguson about the proposed increase in the tax structure for wine. We are somewhat limited in the time available for debate, and I do not want to revisit a number of the issues that have been raised by my colleagues in this debate or that were discussed at length during the debate on the budget bills in October 1993. It is sad that we have to revisit these issues so soon. Having had a massive increase in tax in that 1993 budget, less than two years later we are revisiting a potential tax increase being imposed on this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not canvass the issue of a comparison of like industries and the illogicality of comparing the wine industry with other alcoholic beverage manufacturers; nor will I deal in detail with the need to encourage a successful but nevertheless vulnerable industry because it provides significant employment in Australia and most importantly in regional areas rather than in the capital cities. This employment occurs not only at the agricultural coalface&mdash;the actual growing of grapes for the wine industry&mdash;but also in adjunctive manufacturing industries which produce labels, bottles, cartons, harvesting equipment and so on. It also generates employment in service industries ranging from the waterfront to restaurants. These are issues of great importance which have been dealt with to various degrees by others in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main point I wish to make concerns the contribution the wine industry makes to the Australian economy through export sales. That contribution cannot be ignored given our dismal current account deficit and the consequent need for an urgent improvement in that regard. Month after month under this government we are racking up a further current account debt. That in turn increases our foreign debt year after year. The wine industry has a remarkable record in recent years with regard to lifting its export performance. Therefore, it needs every encouragement if we are going to do anything at all to overcome our current account deficit problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government ought to remember that if we are simply going to stabilise our foreign debt at its current level, four per cent of our current domestic production has to earn export income. That is an enormous task which will not be achieved under the policies of this government but will certainly be achieved when there is a change of government. It is an enormous task, but one which the wine industry is making a successful contribution to. Even so, the wine industry is now targeted for a further tax increase which would destroy its capacity to make that contribution in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry has had very little help from the government during its developmental stages. Last year was the first time an Australian wine company was granted a federal government loan&mdash;BRL Hardy was granted $3 billion. That was the biggest loan provided to an Australia company under the international trade enhancement scheme. I emphasis the point that that was the first time the wine industry had been helped in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was certainly an extraordinary recognition of the contribution that the wine industry makes to Australian export earnings. Was this a turnaround in the government's attitude from its failure to have any appreciation of the impact of its intended 55 per cent increase in wholesale sales tax on wine in the 1993 budget? Apparently not. Yet again we face the menace of tax increases staring the industry in the face less than two years later. The government is true to its word. When the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, taunts us with tax rises, without any mandate whatsoever to do so, for once we can believe him and know that he means what he says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a wine producing country, Australia's effective wine taxes are the second highest in the world&mdash;more than 2 1/2 times greater than the average imposed in other wine producing countries and a staggering eight times higher than the tax of the lowest taxed wine producing country, Italy. It is worth bearing that fact in mind when we are considering this very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993-94, Australia's wine exports hit a record 130,619 million litres which is worth almost $359 million in export earnings. The compound annual growth rate of wine exports to countries such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Sweden, the United States, Canada and Japan over the 10-year period from 1983-84 was 27.1 per cent. That is a remarkable performance from this industry. This strong international growth is attributed to the competitive productivity of Australia's wine industry when compared with traditional wine producing countries which do not have our advantages of relatively low land costs, mechanised harvesting and pruning equipment, and which are often restricted by traditional wine making methods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to remember that this march on the market may be eroded as new entrants come into the industry. Chile, Bulgaria and South Africa are all expanding their wine grape production. Chilean nationals are currently being trained in viticulture in my home state of South Australia. While there are benefits to be gained for South Australia by being involved in such a training program, we need to remember the downside of that and the inherent risk which is the benefit it gives to Chile as a competitor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, we must do everything possible to ensure that Australia retains its competitive advantages in this industry and not load it up with taxes, as it seems this government wants to do. The industry's key challenge is growth in the supply of premium grapes. The 1993 vintage was affected by disease and bad weather, which led to a supply shortage. This has to be appreciated in the context of competitive threats posed by a fruit surplus in traditional European wine making countries such as Italy, France, Spain and Portugal. Although the 1994 national grape crop was a record 715,000 tonnes, the inevitable impact of drought on the 1995 vintage cannot be ignored. Australia's international position in wine exporting is not assured without growth in supply. It is widely acknowledged that the next three years will be much more difficult than the previous three years of record export performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry expectations of the government's inquiry and the committee's report were for a better government understanding of the wine industry's vulnerabilities and strengths. It seems the industry was a little too optimistic. There are many wine grape growing regions throughout the country, all of which will feel the effects of an increase in wholesale sales tax on wine. In my home state of South Australia, the Riverland, the Barossa Valley, the Adelaide Hills, the Clare Valley, the Eden Valley, the Southern Vales regions and the Coonawarra depend on the wine industry for jobs and regional economic boosts generated by tourism to their vineyards. But this government seems intent on decimating the wine industry, which is essential to rural and regional economic viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with a comment I made during a speech I made the last time the government wanted to raise the wholesale tax on wine. I think it is worth repeating: it does not matter if you drink wine or not, the fact is that this tax will hurt, unjustifiably and in a regionally discriminatory way, ordinary and already tax burdened Australians who derive their income from that industry. In August 1993&mdash;it is good to see that he is in chamber at the moment&mdash;Senator Sherry came up with the astonishing comment that, for a couple paying $100 to dine out in a restaurant, an additional $1.50 to $2 retail price increase on a $20 bottle of wine is not such a significant proportion of the total cost. </PARA>

It is insulting and myopic, and confirms the inability of the government to see the wisdom of supporting, rather than inhibiting, our viable export industries. If we are going to continue to provide the opportunities for this industry to grow, we need a tax regime that has some long-term stability and consistency to ensure that there is certainty for investors. Investors must know they can invest, given that there is a long time frame involved in investment in this industry before returns are obtained. They need to be confident that the tax regime will remain stable so that they can make some long-term assessment of returns from their investment. If they do not have that, then we are not going to get the investment required to continue the expansion of this industry. So I strongly support Senator Ferguson's motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

The first part of the motion sums up entirely the policy approach the Labor government has followed&mdash;a policy of increasing taxation on any industry which shows signs of being successful. One only needs to look at various rural enterprises to know that any time any industry looks like doing well, the monkey gets put firmly on the back of that industry by the Labor government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you really want the good wine that I know Senator Murphy likes to drink, you have to put it away and store it for a while so it matures. Then people really enjoy it. The wine industry is different to the beer industry. In the beer industry, the ingredients go from the paddock to the factory, with somebody else growing the barley for the malting purposes. Beer gets drunk pretty quickly, but wine is different. It has a much longer lead-up time, and it needs a different appreciation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is disagreement, however, amongst the committee  members who wrote this IC report as to how such a tax regime should be structured. The chairman, Bill Scales, has proposed a sales tax increase from 24 to 31 per cent plus the introduction of an excise duty of $4 per litre of alcohol. The other two members of the committee supported the introduction of an excise duty but recommended that the sales tax be lowered to 10 per cent. That is a good idea. This, in effect, would be revenue neutral for the government. It is probably a safe bet to suggest that the government will not accept the revenue neutral line because, in its usual style, it will try to rip more tax out of the industry and the consumers&mdash;straight from the people's pockets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of an excise duty is likely to increase the cost of fortified wines and also push sales of wine from cask to bottled. From a wine lover's point of view&mdash;and, as I said, Senator Murphy likes his wine, and so do I&mdash;and certainly from a winemaker's point of view, this latter outcome is probably a good thing. While we laud the success of the Australian wine industry and its export drive, many in the industry are suggesting already that the industry is not as buoyant as some would like to think. In fact, this has already been mentioned earlier today by Senator Minchin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> suggests that the targeted $1 billion sales by the year 2000 has already been pared back to $750 million. In fact, the volume of wine exports for the first four months of the 1994-95 financial year is down 7.8 per cent compared to 1993, although the value is up by five per cent. Investors in the industry in recent years have reacted to this decline in sales volume, and the price of wine companies listed on the stock exchange has dropped. That is not good, either. We want good companies producing good wines in buoyant circumstances; we do not want companies hit by extra taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> suggests that, for many smaller listed companies, the crunch is yet to come. The difficulty for the industry at both the large export level and the small boutique winery level is that the industry cannot afford dramatic changes in the tax regime that affects sales. As I said earlier, because there is such a lead-up time from planting to production, the wine industry has to be treated differently to other industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vine growers were encouraged to expand and others were encouraged to invest in this country in order to meet the new export demand that has been some years in coming, but it is possible that the response has been too good.

I think you have to listen, minister, because you have a voice in structuring what is going to happen in the budget; you are a part of it.

If you are going to turn around and say, `Now we have got you in we will milk you for all we can'&mdash;or squeeze you, I suppose, if you are thinking about grapes&mdash;that investment money will simply go elsewhere, including offshore.

This government should take heed of the overwhelming view expressed in the Australian Senate, in response to this wine industry inquiry, that there be no increase in taxes on wine grapes or wine so that this flushing industry will be able to contribute to not only exports but also the prosperity which it is bringing to so many states, especially South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to be a Liberal South Australian senator. I am proud that my colleague Senator Ferguson has initiated this important debate. My colleague Senator Brownhill has just spoken on the wine industry in New South Wales, which is his home state. Senator Troeth has spoken about Victoria. Senator Reid, the Liberal coalition whip in the Senate, has spoken about the wine industry in the national capital, the ACT. We have referred rightly to the wine industry in Western Australia and Tasmania. Not one government senator has spoken on behalf of the rural communities that are dependent on the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a South Australian, I join with so many of my Liberal colleagues from South Australia. They have been the predominant participants in this debate, because South Australia produces the great majority of Australia's good wine. Those in the chamber who like a glass of red find that South Australia produces the great majority of quality red wine in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak on behalf of the South Australian rural communities in the Clare Valley, the Barossa, the Eden Valley, the Riverland and the Gawler districts. A small remnant of the very best wines is grown in the Adelaide plains. There is also the Southern Vales community, Langhorne Creek, Padthaway and Coonawarra. These are the premium wine producing areas of South Australia and, as I see it rather parochially, of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are more than 3,500 grape growing establishments in Australia. The number of hectares put to vines has doubled in the last 20 years. This has been rightly included by Senator Ferguson in the preamble to his motion, which rejects increases in tax on the wine industry. If part of those taxes were added to the increased taxes that were put on the industry two years ago, we would see disastrous effects with regard to the families who are employed in this important area domestically. It would also have a totally counterproductive effect upon exports and the investments that are generating those exports in the most successful rural producing industry in Australia in the last several years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been right for us to recognise in this debate that there is sunshine on the wine industry. There is a twinkle in the eye of wine producers. That twinkle will go if there is any increase in taxes. The sun will be blackened if there is any increase in wine taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note, as have a number of those who have contributed to this debate, that wine is not just any other drink. It takes seven years to produce a quality wine. In my view, it takes at least another seven years in the bottle for red wine to reach peak maturity for consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most other liquids that we consume are easily produced. However much the quality which comes with skill and professionalism in the production of beer or a whole range of citrus drinks, a whole range of milk drinks, or a whole range of mineral waters, there are important liquids that we all consume, to which I would add spirits, particularly some of the bottles of scotch, many of which, frankly, are imported to this country. A huge amount of skill, carefulness and centuries of tradition go into producing some of these bottles. But nothing that we drink has the same carefulness of production required of wine. We must be realistic and practical in understanding the unique product that is wine. We should look very carefully before we kill any goose that is laying golden eggs, before doing anything that jeopardises this important industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention these characteristics of wine because Australia is so well placed, given the qualities of our wine producing regions, to export wine to the whole of Asia&mdash;indeed, the whole of the world. We have had an enormous increase in wine exports to Europe, Asia and even the United States. I believe that our exports have only just begun that upward path. This glimmer in Australia's eye at the moment is caused by our wine exports increasing at a greater rate than any other product, primary or secondary. It is that observation which has led Mr Keating and the Labor government to say, `Let's tax them some more.' The message of the Senate today in this debate, overwhelmingly, is: do not kill the goose that lays the golden egg; make sure that we see that export growth increase in the same way that it has over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to make a direct point about investment. If the profitability of the last two years is recognised by all of us on any side of this debate, it ought to be also recognised that, if there are increasing profits from the wine industry, they are to repay and consolidate investments that have led to the doubling of wine grape production over the last 20 years, which is the consolidation that is needed at this stage in the development of the industry. If there is an increase in a wine tax, whether of the variety advocated by Mr Scales or the variety advocated by Brian Croser&mdash;the majority or minority report&mdash;it will jeopardise the consolidation of the investment base of this important industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me get close to home and say that in my first speech in this Senate some 17 years ago, I touched upon the plight of South Australian grape growers because of my own government's meddling with an increased tax on the wine industry. I see Senator Murphy warming to agree with me. I ask him to show the same criticism of any move by his own government that would in any way accept either of the recommendations of this wine industry inquiry. Like all governments, the Fraser government, back in 1978, was looking for more revenue. That is what is driving Mr Keating at the moment&mdash;more revenue. The Fraser government saw the possibility of increasing imposts on the wine industry&mdash;and the brandy tax was to go up. </PARA>

But I sometimes use a mixed metaphor to make the point all the more dramatically and there was at that time one part of the Fraser government which was in danger of being lost. It turns out that the Fraser government was not deterred by this new, young&mdash;I think at the time the youngest senator in the chamber, and certainly the newest&mdash;senator saying, `You are wrong about the brandy tax.' It was imposed anyway. Guess what happened? Revenue over the next couple of years went down because brandy sales plummeted and the increase in the tax led to a disaster for government revenue&mdash;that means all consumers of government services&mdash;and it was a disaster for the grape growers because, as we know, in any harvest of grapes, the grapes that are not just right for a particular variety of wine production are made into straight alcohol and blended with caramel to make brandy. When the grape growers could not sell the grapes that were ready for this remaindering, they suffered extraordinarily in 1978 and 1979.</PARA></TALK.START>

The other day when I, along with other South Australia senators, was briefed by the Premier of South Australia, Dean Brown, he put to us the South Australian government's analysis of this wine industry inquiry. He announced clearly that the South Australia government was opposed to both the majority report and the minority report. The state was opposed to any increase in the wine tax because of its calculated impact upon South Australia; it would be to the detriment of our state. Mr Bilney put in a clear apology to that meeting and identified himself with the need for all of us to be briefed and to get the facts about the wine industry, not only in the seat of Kingston in the Southern Vales, but in every part of South Australia. I would say, generously as a South Australian, that that stands for New South Wales, Tasmania, Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. There will be an organised reaction against any proposal that would increase tax on the wine industry. That will have its effect on the ballot box. </PARA>

I should say to members of the public who are listening to this debate about this important industry, the wine industry, that only twice a month in the Senate do we have what is termed an opportunity to contribute to general business. The priority of determining the topic for discussion in general business is much fought over. Today, in this one of two opportunities in the month, there was overwhelming support for Senator Ferguson's proposed motion. It is topical. It has been said by so many speakers that it is the right time for senators to put their views so quickly after we have been able to read the outcome of the wine industry inquiry and to make it abundantly clear to this government that we reject the tax proposals in that inquiry. </PARA>

In her comments in this debate Senator Lees did not make it clear that she opposed any increase in the tax on wine. As a matter of fact, I will read the transcript tomorrow very carefully. I am sure grape growers in South Australia will also read very carefully what Senator Lees had to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my understanding, Senator Lees said that she opposed the minority report, which was the report of Mr Scales. That report proposed a far larger increase in the tax on wine than did the majority report, which I believe she said in her speech she had some sympathy for. That was the introduction of new tax, a tax by volume of alcohol, as well as a wholesale sales tax. If my recollections are clear&mdash;I did listen very carefully&mdash;I am quite sure Senator Lees has some sympathy for the majority report, the draft report of the inquiry, with regard to an increase in the tax on wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, I am quite sure the grape growers of South Australia, whom Senator Woodley says Senator Lees has such sophisticated communications with, will be very disappointed to find out that she does in fact have some sympathy for the majority report of Mr Brian Croser and Professor Freebairn, which advocated a change in the taxation treatment of wine which would in effect be an increase in the taxation on wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grape growers in the Riverland produce 33 per cent of Australia's grape production, of which only 25 per cent are premium grapes. The other 75 per cent is basically for the bulk market, which is where the new proposed taxation treatment in the recommendation of Mr Croser and Professor Freebairn will hit. It will hit the low priced, bulk producer far harder than it will the premium grape grower, which Mr Croser is himself with his Petaluma Wines. It will hit the bulk producer far harder than it will hit the producer of premium wines. I would like to know what Senator Lees's attitude is to that particular recommendation. As I said, I will read the transcript very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder what the people in the irrigation areas of the River Murray in Victoria and the others would think&mdash;the bulk producers of wine. I wonder what they would say to the Democrats's position, which was reinforced by Senator Spindler. Senator Spindler said that he rejected outright the minority report of Mr Scales, which proposed massive increases. But he never said that he rejected the majority report of Mr Croser and Professor Freebairn, which in this motion we urge the government to reject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we are bringing this issue up today, the reason we want this discussed and brought out into the open and debated today, is that there are people involved in investment in the wine industry and who have invested in the past four years. Some of those investments were made on the premise of tax arrangements existing prior to the 1993 budget. Some of them rely heavily on export promotion and on remaining competitive in the export fields. When there is a long lead time, as there is with grapes&mdash;we are talking about seven years; I know it takes a lot less than that to actually drink a bottle of wine&mdash;I think it is important that we provide some certainty for those people who are prepared to invest in the future of Australia and in the future of Australia's wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state of South Australia there have been literally thousands of hectares of new plantings of vines over the past couple of years. We must give those people some certainty that they are investing in an industry which is going to work under the same taxation treatment rules that it has over the past couple of years. We cannot do anything about the effect of international markets, droughts or the quality of the wine year by year, but we can put some certainty into the framework that would allow investment with some certainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Teague said, we would like to know where government senators stand on the issue of an increase in taxation on wine. Not one government senator spoke on this motion. Not one government senator indicated whether they would oppose a taxation increase on wine. Not one government senator got up and said that they supported this industry, which is the one bright light in the rural economy, the one industry that has got off its backside and done the promotional work and got into the export trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about an export trade by the year 2000 potentially worth $1 billion. When we think about our current account deficit, $1 billion in exports is absolutely essential to economic recovery and to doing something to reverse the balance of payments trend that we have seen over the past few years. I would like to think that at least one government senator could have got up and supported the wine industry and said, `We believe that the wine industry is an industry that on its own behalf has managed to drag itself out of the difficulties it was in in the 1980s, and we will make sure that we leave in place the existing framework of taxation treatment which allows them to plan with certainty and to invest with certainty.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If just one government senator had got up and said, `We support the wine industry and we will do our utmost to make sure that the framework that is in place will remain so there is certainty for investors,' those in the wine industry, particularly the grape growers, would be very relieved to know there was someone on the government side who supported them in their endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no need for me to go over any of the other remarks that have been made by my colleagues.

I urge all senators to support this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this report because it does concern me directly, and I think it is appropriate for me to give a response to the report. I need to point out that the reference to the Privileges Committee was made not by me but by a couple of Liberal Party senators. I do not want to question their motivation but I suspect that they had some thought of embarrassing me over the issue. The reference was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether Senator Woodley was threatened in relation to the Port Hinchinbrook development in the manner referred to by him in debate in the Senate on 21 September 1994, and, if so, whether any contempt was committed.</PARA>
<PARA>As I read the reference, and the way in which the Privileges Committee has interpreted this, I understand that the matter of the threat was in relation to me and the matter of contempt was in relation to developer Mr Keith Williams. The committee was convinced apparently by both the submission and the documentation which I gave to it that in fact Mr Williams had threatened me. I will read some of the relevant parts of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the documents tabled with this report indicate, it is clear that Mr Williams sought to protect his own interests vigorously and outspokenly. The aggressive way in which he prosecuted his campaigns understandably gives rise to a perception that such behaviour is threatening.</PARA>
<PARA>I will leave a little bit out and come back to it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All Senators and Members of Parliament receive threats of this nature and regard them, in Senator Woodley's words, as "part of the risk of public life". The Committee believes that Senator Woodley was threatened by Mr Williams in this sense.</PARA>
<PARA>Whether or not there was some motivation in the reference to embarrass me, the Privileges Committee certainly agreed that I was threatened. So that dispenses with that. Although the committee upheld my submission, it is interesting that the Liberal senators failed in their attempt to have Mr Williams cited for contempt. The report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee does not regard the actions in this case as having had the effect or tendency of substantially obstructing a senator in the performance of his duties . . . but observes that he was not in fact deterred, nor was he obstructed, by these threats. In this context, the Committee notes that it was not Senator Woodley who raised the threats as a matter of privilege, which he might have chosen to do if he had felt himself deterred or obstructed in the performance of his duty as a Senator.</PARA>
<PARA>The report concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has not found that a contempt was committed in respect of the matter referred.</PARA>
<PARA>Whatever the motivation of referring this matter was, it certainly vindicated the comments I made in the Senate which were the subject of the reference, but it failed to bring the conclusion which those who referred it were seeking&mdash;to cite Mr Williams for contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a mild criticism of the decision of the Privileges Committee. I am a little curious about the reason given as to why Mr Williams should not be cited for contempt. The reason seems to be that Mr Williams was not in contempt of the Senate because I refused to be deterred from doing my job. If I had said that I was inhibited by him and was unable to do my job, the committee may have come to a different decision. But I certainly did not feel that I needed to be threatened by Mr Williams to the extent that it would stop me from doing what I believed I ought to do. However, it is an interesting question for the committee to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the report and indicate to the Senate that there were three main issues that I raised in my submission which resulted from the reference and the context in which the reference was made. The first relates to the style Mr Williams uses when he responds to criticisms of things that he does. I cited a number of documents that go back some years. One was a threat that was made on Mr Doug Jennings, a National Party MLA. Unfortunately, he has died since this exchange took place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was remarkable MLA. I have no equivocation in saying that he really was afraid of no-one. He was threatened by Mr Williams. I cited the letter of apology from Mr Williams which was tabled in the Queensland parliament in 1982. Mr Williams had apparently told Mr Jennings that he would punch him right between the eyes. He also said, `You're a prize germ and I warn you I have my way of dealing with germs.' This is the style of the gentleman we are dealing with. To say the least, he is a very colourful person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cited a number of other documents that supported my reference to the style Mr Williams uses when he approaches these matters. I cited a facsimile of last year from the Office of the Coordinator General of the Queensland government. That office seems to be afraid of what Mr Williams might do. The fax states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier today I had a telephone conversation with Mr Williams in which he told me he was about to instruct his solicitors to proceed against various ministers and senior executive officers of the state. This shows you the extreme pressure we are under.</PARA>
<PARA>Again we can see the rather aggressive style this gentleman uses when conducting his business. Another part of my submission dealt with the threats that Mr Williams made against other people such as Mr Bissmire and Mr Whitehead. The one that distresses me most is his legal action against an aged pensioner from Cardwell, Mrs Margaret Thorsborne. She is a wonderful lady. She is an inspiring person and a great Australian. She was named Cardwell citizen of the year and has received numerous awards. The Thorsborne Trail on Hinchinbrook Island is named after her and her husband. I could go on and on. Mr Williams has taken it upon himself to take her to court in relation to, what in my mind, is a very trivial matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am more concerned about the threats on people like Mrs Thorsborne than the threats on me because I believe they are very unfair. I detailed the threats against me and gave details of two telephone conversations and produced a number of press releases which again are fairly colourful. On one occasion Mr Williams said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Woodley is smart enough to shield his errors behind parliamentary privilege and has already refused my challenge to make his statements in open forum and then face the consequences.</PARA>
<PARA>I inform the Senate that I made the statements to which Mr Williams refers on the ABC. Although I simply repeated matters that I had raised in the Senate, the ABC apparently was not quite game to broadcast the particular interview. The Senate needs to know that we are dealing with a very interesting and colourful person and someone who at times is a little more aggressive than he needs to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I close with some quotes from a recent address that Mr Williams gave to the Rotary Club of Innisfail. It is recorded in much detail in the Innisfail paper. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, as you are the deputy chairperson of the Senate Committee of Privileges, you are very aware of the way our committee has deliberated over this matter. In introducing the findings of our committee report as chairman, I moved that the Senate endorse the findings of the committee. It is fully appropriate that Senator Woodley has spoken. I have listened carefully to all that he has said about the matter of any person in Australia, whether they are rich or poor, whether they are greatly achieving or not, and I fully accept from my good colleague Senator Herron that Mr Williams has been a great achiever in Queensland. That does not come into the issue of matters that are in the principles directly needing to be upheld by the Senate through the Senate Privileges Committee's considerations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, a senator other than Senator Woodley, noting his speech at the time that referred to the confrontation between himself and this developer, heard the nature of the threat that was being made. We had to therefore consider whether that threat was of such a nature that it would lead to the Senate finding that the person making the threat was in contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already outlined our findings. That is all set out in the report so I will not repeat it, but it may be useful to clarify one matter raised in Senator Woodley's speech. He acknowledged very much what we had observed in his submission&mdash;that he was not deterred by the aggressive, even hectoring, way that Mr Williams was in confrontation with him. Senator Woodley raised the question,`I guess if I had said that I had been inhibited perhaps a finding of contempt would have followed.' It is just that leftover area that was still in doubt in Senator Woodley's mind that I wish to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view, as Chairman of the Privileges Committee, that when we would bring a recommendation about such a matter to the Senate, we would need to establish: was a threat actually made? Was it a threat of such a nature that it obstructed a senator from his or her course of duty? More than that, there is a third question: was the threat that deterred or inhibited the senator from prosecuting a matter that was being followed by that senator substantial, credible and almost to the point of being unlawfully inhibiting of the senator?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would not wish to make it automatic that if a senator is deterred from some action by a threat that any citizen makes, therefore, because the senator admits he or she was inhibited or deterred, the finding of contempt would flow to the person who made the threat. No; we are not in the business, and Senator Woodley is certainly not in the business, of protecting what we would call uncourageous or weak-kneed behaviour on the part of any senator. It would also be just too easy for us, when we receive threats virtually on a daily basis, to entrap a person who would be threatening us if that were automatic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No; we have to ask the third question: was the threat which the senator admits inhibited him or her of such a nature, to such an extent, even of an unlawful kind, that a recommendation ought to be made that that person was in contempt of the Senate? There is not anything automatic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think in this case it was all the clearer because Senator Woodley was not deterred. I would wish, as one senator, to commend Senator Woodley and, indeed, the great majority of senators who go about their work and follow up their conscientious views. They are part of public debate and public life in this country; they may be threatened every day but they are not deterred from going on with their conscientiously held views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a wonderful thing in this chamber that we all recognise that we all have a right to be here. We were all elected to be here. We all have different views but we are to be protected by the mechanisms of the Senate in holding our views conscientiously and we should not be inhibited from following them through. Whether we are Labor senators, Democrat senators, Liberal or National Party senators, we will not make decisions in these matters that are in any way related to the particularity of the debate or the particularity of the views being expressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wish to make sure it is understood in Australia that if any person threatens a senator in such a way that it is not only deterring that senator from what he or she would ordinarily do but which, almost by its own nature, is an unlawful action, they will not just be subject to the criminal law in a particular state but they may well be subject to a finding of contempt of the Senate.

That huge by-election result for the Liberal Party was the beginning of the end for the then Labor government. Similarly, this coming Saturday the electors of Canberra have a unique opportunity to continue the momentum of the polls by sending a clear and direct message to this tired Labor government, so tired in fact that the bleeding heart letter from Dr Carmen Lawrence sent to Canberra women was a pathetic replica of a letter used by her in another campaign in South Australia. That is how genuine Dr Lawrence and Labor are to the women voters of Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this letter, Dr Lawrence led with her chin. The opening sentence stated, `Things still need to change for women.' What a true statement. After 12 years of Labor things definitely need to change for women and the best change would be a vote for Brendan Smyth who would be a further voice for choice for the women in Canberra in the incoming Howard government. Under Labor, women have no choice.

They have said for some reason that the deferral of the Racial Hatred Bill was because we did not want to discuss the matter before the New South Wales election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Labor Party that I am willing to discuss our immigration policy on any day of the week at any time. Each time I will quote the comment of the honourable member for Blaxland that, after all, the best migrant is the infant Australian. How does Senator McKiernan, who is from the government side, feel about that term `an immigrant to this country'? How should I feel about it, as an immigrant to this country? How should the hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New South Wales feel about those comments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are shameful and hurtful comments and they reflect on a person that the Prime Minister embraces. The Prime Minister moved to have him reintroduced into the Labor Party. Indeed, he is a former Labor premier of New South Wales whose anti-Semitic views and white Australia policy are well known. Yet the Prime Minister of this country embraced him as an idol. It becomes absolutely clear why Jim McKenzie, with these outrageous policies, such as stopping all immigration now, would give his preferences to the ALP. That policy is in the hearts and minds of people like former Premier of New South Wales Jack Lang and his underling, the Prime Minister of Australia. That is what the Prime Minister said. Now that the Prime Minister has achieved high office, he makes all the right sounding speeches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we then have the migration legislation. The comments of Senator McKiernan and others in this place show that they have no regard for migrants in this country. All they are interested in from time to time is funding a few groups and bodies, as the former member for Canberra did so shamefully in the sports rorts affair. It all comes back to why we are having a by-election in Canberra. Mrs Kelly was forced from the ministry because of her shameful activity on sports rorts. She then resigned from the parliament, as she should have done at the very beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives me no joy to have to reflect on the Prime Minister of this country in this way but the truth needs to be spoken about his attitude to migrants. Let me simply repeat what he said: `After all, the best migrant is the infant Australian.' Every single migrant in the electorate of Canberra and in New South Wales ought to keep that in mind when they cast their vote on Saturday, 25 March because, if they want to look after themselves, they cannot vote for a Labor Party with such an outrageous leader who has made such outrageous statements. </PARA>

The Liberals have been running around on the hospital issue saying the Commonwealth government has ripped off about $300 million from the state; the Commonwealth has underpaid it. That again is an untruth of huge magnitude. In fact, the Commonwealth has increased its funding to the state by more than $2 billion since 1988-89.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell senators about some of the things that government has been promising in the election campaign. Let us examine two seats, the electorates of Bathurst and Coffs Harbour. Coffs Harbour is a marginal National Party seat. There is a good campaign being run there. Bathurst is a safe Labor seat. New hospitals are needed in Lithgow and Coffs Harbour. What happens? Lithgow is promised a loan of about $7 million so a community group can set up a community hospital. Coffs Harbour gets some $50 million to build a brand spanking new hospital. Coffs Harbour is a marginal National Party seat whereas Bathurst is a safe Labor seat. This is the sort of thing this government has been doing in New South Wales. It has the hide to say we have been underfunding it by $300 million; but it took $300 million out of the hospital budget. The Liberal government also will not tell us what are the waiting lists in New South Wales for the last six months. It has obliged by not telling us. </PARA>

Last year a woman I know of was kept waiting two years at least for a knee and hip operation&mdash;orthopaedic surgery. I am sure it was because she had a psychiatric problem.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that people need to be conscious of, as was mentioned earlier, is what Mr Fahey did as minister for industrial relations when he was in charge of the State Superannuation Board.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an aggrieved person who has suffered at the hands of its discriminatory superannuation policy, I think it is disgraceful. I would also draw your attention to the fact that one of its property developments was the Governor Macquarie Tower. The government is now going to put a lot of the government offices in that tower, including on the top floor a penthouse suite for the Premier. It already has a suite in the State Office Block which it has just refurbished and has given to him free at taxpayers' cost. But at the same time he has claimed his $19,000-odd travelling allowance and used that to pay off his daughter's school fees so that she can attend one of the most exclusive boarding schools in the whole of Australia.</PARA>

The cheap shots were scored over a few thousand dollars involving a problem with the tax office. Tomorrow, some anti-Liberal people who are supporting the Independent state MP for Manly, Dr P. Macdonald&mdash;and it would astound me if amongst those anti-Liberal people there would not be people from the Labor Party&mdash;will be dropping what is known as a bucket on the Liberal candidate for Manly at the last minute in the campaign for the state election, so denying Mr Oldfield the opportunity of an effective response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for these reasons that I am intervening in this matter. If the purpose of the bucket job is to demonstrate that Dr Macdonald is a man of greater integrity than his opponents, then it simply will not work. The reason is that Dr Macdonald's own taxation record shows a lack of integrity that must be of major concern to his constituents in Manly. I have evidence which I now seek leave to table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to the Senate for allowing me to table the evidence. It shows that Dr Macdonald understated his income by more than $100,000 over the few years leading up to his election to the State parliament before his tax was adjusted upwards in 1992 as a result of a tax audit. Dr Macdonald's tax, that had been avoided over all these years, was then of course significantly increased. The details of this are evident from the document I have just tabled. It is clear from that document that Dr Macdonald claimed that he had a taxable income in 1988 of $7,192. After being adjusted by the tax office after its audit, his taxable income rose to $47,816. In other words, he understated his income by $40,625. That is a considerable amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the taxes that go to providing the services for schools, hospitals and so on, that this member claims he is doing his best to bring to his area. In 1987 he said his taxable income was $4,850. The audit increased his tax by $28,595 so that it ended up at $33,445. Similar substantial adjustments, but not quite as large as that, occurred in previous years. For example, his tax in 1986, which he claimed to be $5,213, was adjusted up to $17,000. His 1985 tax of $5,200 was adjusted up to $19,600. In 1984 his $4,019 tax was adjusted up to $12,648. Over these six years he had claimed that he earned only $58,000 whereas the revised figure shows $160,000. In other words, he understated his income by something like $102,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the intriguing things about this is that this emerged from an audit of Dr Macdonald's income tax returns according to the tax office's letter of 26 February 1992. By the way, the tax office thanked Dr Macdonald for his time and cooperation during the conduct of the audit. There is no suggestion that Dr Macdonald tried to disrupt or impede the tax audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the adjustments were made in accordance with Dr Macdonald's advice dated 10 September 1991. I remind the Senate that Dr Macdonald got elected to the Legislative Assembly in New South Wales in March 1991. Either his conscience took six months to gestate or it was an interesting coincidence that he became notified of the fact that he had significantly understated his tax only after he became a member of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does strike me as strange that this avoidance is, in relative terms, massive when compared with the few thousand dollars involved in the notorious Smiles affair that this Labor government seems to enjoy parading around the place as some kind of significant matter. I would hope that the Labor Party would show equal enthusiasm about the fact that Dr Macdonald not only had understated his income but also was then obliged to provide substantial additional tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives me no particular pleasure to do to Dr Macdonald what his supporters are seeking to do to a Liberal candidate. If the game is going to be played like this, so that at the last minute buckets are going to be dropped, then I think people who drop buckets&mdash;I acknowledge this for myself, too&mdash;have to face the risk of having buckets dropped on them. I acknowledge that and I have always been prepared to cop it in this place. I remind senators opposite that I copped buckets which certainly did not belong to me for two years after I first came into parliament. You will have to give a lot better interjections than you have managed so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is certainly, I believe, not the way to fight the state election in New South Wales. I think it is most regrettable that Mr Oldfield is going to be subjected to a bucket job tomorrow, at the last minute. The only reason I am doing this, as I have said before, is to indicate to Dr  Macdonald and his supporters that this is not the proper way to conduct an election campaign. If he wants to play it that way, he should know that he has some other hardball players down here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make one remark in conclusion, because I notice that Senator Neal is to speak after me. It relates to the accounts, if they exist, of the New South Wales Labor Party's building company, Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd. The normal auditor's qualification when a company's liabilities exceed its assets would be that the company can continue in business only with the support of its bankers; in this case, the Commonwealth Bank. I do not know whether any such qualification exists on this company's accounts because there appear to be no accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Neal is going to get up and tell us that there are accounts and that they have been audited, I can then say to her: why on earth has the Australian Securities Commission not been so advised?

I encourage her to explain, perhaps on behalf of her husband, how this curious situation came about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to hear her tell us what penalties have been imposed by the Australian Securities Commission for breaches of ASC regulations involving the late lodgment of this company's accounts for 1991, 1992 and 1993, all of which were lodged on the same day in 1994. I would hope penalties have been imposed and, frankly, with this curious situation, I wonder about the prospect of prosecutions, because it seems to me that flouting the law would not be a matter entertained by the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity tonight to refute some of the blatant untruths that have been peddled by Senator Baume. I must confess that I consider myself unfortunate to have entered the Senate at a time when we have a senator such as Senator Baume because, as he said earlier this evening, what goes around does come around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen that there are two types of senators. There are those who make a reasoned and worthwhile contribution. They have their points of views, which may be different from mine, but they work to the best of their ability. Their interests are the interests of the people of Australia. There are people like that on both sides. It is unfortunate that Senator Baume is not one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think I have ever heard Senator Baume say anything on any issue that does not require him making some kind of slanderous or derogatory remark about someone else, be they in this chamber or elsewhere. A person like that, who sees his role entirely limited to that sort of activity, should examine whether he is doing anything for the people of Australia, particularly the people of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment briefly on the situation in Manly. I was not going to comment on that matter but, since Senator Baume has raised it, I will. I am not aware of the allegations that he has made about Peter Macdonald. It is unfortunate that he has breached Dr Macdonald's right to privacy by obtaining access to his tax returns. I am sure that he has used means that he considers proper but which the vast number of Australians would consider improper. I suggest that he could have raised these matters at an earlier time were it not for the fact that Peter Macdonald was instrumental in keeping the coalition government in power in New South Wales for so long. I will leave it to Senator Baume's own conscience to deal with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an ad today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manly Daily</EMPHASIS>, purporting to come from the Labor Party&mdash;it did not come from the Labor Party&mdash;which said, `Message to Labor voters: if you are voting Labor in this election, vote No. 1 Brian Green, the Labor candidate, and do not distribute preferences.' Isn't that amazing. I wonder whom that came from. Very clearly, it came from coalition supporters. If you are going to talk about dirty tricks in Manly, you should look at that because it will be raised after the election and will probably have severe repercussions for the people involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal with some of the untruths Senator Baume has stated over the last week. He has this affliction&mdash;he has to embroil himself in matters in a negative and unconstructive manner with scant regard for the truth in certain matters. I probably cannot deal with all of his untruths but I will deal with a few of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His first untruth is that Labor Centenary House has not lodged its annual returns. That is not true, as Senator Baume well knows. I saw him looking at those returns as he went down the stairs one day. The returns have been lodged and I am happy to table them tonight. The next return is not due until July 1995 and I suspect that even Senator Baume could work out that that date has not been reached yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add here that in a debate on the adjournment earlier this week, Senator Baume stated some untruths about me peddling untruthful facts to the press gallery. He did that without giving me the courtesy of advising me that he was going to make some comments about me so that I could be in the chamber. Again, he made blatantly untrue statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second untrue statement was that the 1993 annual return was not complete. If a company is an exempt proprietary company, as Labor Centenary House is, and it has appointed an auditor under the Companies Code, it is not required to provide the full accounts or the key financial information required of a non-exempt proprietary company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party does meet this criterion. It is an exempt proprietary company and has appointed James Farley Meyer and Co., as has been noted previously, as its auditors. Therefore, it is not required to provide any further financial information. Its annual return is complete, and I am happy to table advice from Ernst and Young, the accountants for the ALP, which substantiates the opinion that Centenary House is an exempt proprietary company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third untruth Senator Baume put forward earlier this week was that Labor Centenary House is technically bankrupt. That is not true. These are the facts: Labor Centenary House is not bankrupt, no creditor of Centenary House has taken action in this regard as petitioned, and there has been no agreement with its creditors. As all debts have fallen due, they have been paid in full.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth untruth by Senator Baume is that the Commonwealth Bank `allowed the New South Wales Labor Party to expand its debts by $4 million or so to enable the party to massively out spend the Liberal Party on election advertising.' The truth is that the ALP's debts have not increased during the campaign, and nor will they. In fact, the ALP has no other debts to the Commonwealth Bank apart from a mortgage of under $6 million. The ALP in New South Wales is funding its election campaign from its cash flow&mdash;that is, from the money it collects during the campaign. The contribution it has received will in fact exceed its expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth untruth was when Senator Baume claimed the ALP was not paying a commercial rate of interest on its loan. Maybe he should borrow my calculator because he has a major difficulty in working out exactly what the rate is. The ALP is paying a commercial rate of just under 10 per cent, negotiated at a set rate at some prior time. The debt owed by the ALP is a mortgage debt; it is not an overdraft, as Senator Baume continues to refer to it. It is at a commercial rate. In many cases, the rates being offered were substantially less but because the ALP is a political party&mdash;bearing in mind its circumstances&mdash;the rate was above the commercial rate when it was originally negotiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth untruth was when Senator Baume claimed that the New South Wales Labor Party has made its mortgage payments in cash. I do not know what little fairy told Senator Baume this, it is completely untrue and I call upon him to tender any evidence he has. Every single payment made to the Commonwealth Bank for payment of the mortgage has been by cheque. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are running an honest campaign that no doubt will bring us victory this weekend in New South Wales while the Liberals, as usual, are spending money on a big poll driven campaign.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us talk for a moment about the fact that the ALP has been very effective in its core business. That is, it has actually won a lot of seats. In the last federal election we ended up with a surplus of $350,000, and we only got 33 seats out of that. How many seats did the Liberal Party get in that election by going into debt? It obtained 11 seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting that the New South Wales Labor Party has not lost a seat&mdash;state or federal&mdash;for the last seven years. The Liberals, in contrast, have not managed to pick up one single Labor seat&mdash;either state or federal&mdash;in all that time. That is not a result of understaffing; in its head office, and in terms of officials, the Liberal Party has a staff of approximately 10 times that of the Labor Party. In fact, on one occasion when they restructured they sacked 70 people. We have only 10 in our office. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMullan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Uruguay Round resulted in the biggest market access tariff reductions package ever achieved in GATT negotiations, being 30 times larger, in terms of trade covered, than outcomes achieved from previous negotiating rounds. In general, tariffs will be cut by between 35% and 60%. Tariffs will be reduced in five equal steps commencing on 1 January 1995. The reductions will be from 1986 base tariff rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On products of interest to Australia the average cut is around 50%. The average bound tariff facing all Australian exports of manufactured products will be less than 2%. Nearly 50% of all Australia's exports will enjoy duty free access to major markets. Less than 6% of Australia's manufactured exports will face a tariff higher than 15% when Uruguay Round commitments are fully implemented. Based on Industry Commission analysis, the long-term export gains will be about $3 billion a year for manufactured products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important result of the Uruguay Round on manufactured products is the commitment by participating countries to "bind" their tariffs. When a country commits itself to bind a tariff at a certain level, it cannot increase this tariff beyond that binding without negotiating compensation for affected trading partners. As a result of the Uruguay Round, developed countries will have tariff bindings at or close to 100% of tariff lines. Developing countries have more than trebled their tariff bindings from 22% to 72% of tariff lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, significant tariffs and other barriers remain in some markets. For example, most ASEAN members did not bind their passenger motor vehicle tariffs during Uruguay Round negotiations. Tariffs in this sector are high&mdash;up to 200%. Some non-ferrous metal tariffs in Asian countries remain higher than industry requested. When tariffs were bound, some were bound at high rates. For instance, Indonesia generally bound its tariffs at 40% in the areas it participated in. Further efforts will be necessary to deal with non-tariff barriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional security for negotiated reductions in trade barriers is provided for by GATT/World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules which ensure that countries do not use other trade measures to restore previous levels of protection. In the area of manufactures, these include revised rules on the use of anti-dumping and countervailing duties, of fees and other charges for customs services and the requirement to grant national treatment (nondiscriminatory treatment) to imported goods once they have entered the customs territory of the importing country.</PARA>

As noted in the answer to question one, the cuts are from 1986 base tariff rates. Many countries, Australia and some ASEAN members included, have undertaken unilateral trade liberalisation programs which have current applied rates lower than their Uruguay Round negotiated end bound rates. For example, Thailand bound PMV tariffs at 80% down from a peak of 200%, but the current applied rate is at a peak of 68.5%. From 1 January this year, Thailand's bound tariff for PMV's is 175%, but this is meaningless as the current applied rates are well below this.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) (a)&amp;(b) The request for the land at Holsworthy was received in the context of the Sydney 2000 Olympic bid. The Commonwealth gave in principle agreement and negotiations are proceeding on terms and conditions. Current planning is for the transfer of the land to be completed by 30 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The NSW (Department of Sport Recreation and Racing) Government has advised that the Olympic Bid candidature file provides that the investment for the Games will provide a long term legacy for the sport. Accordingly, the NSW Government is seeking to acquire sufficient land to ensure that the long term needs of shooting sports can be accommodated on the site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) (a) Closure of the Malabar Rifle Range was a Government decision made in the context of the 1987 Budget. It was considered the continued use of the Malabar for shooting was less appropriate than releasing the land for urban development. In addition, Defence needs were able to be met at existing military facilities at Holsworthy or elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The type of ranges constructed at Malabar do not require constant on going maintenance. Since 1970 only minimal Commonwealth funds have been expended on the ranges and these costs were associated with the maintenance of the site and ensuring the existing facilities were safe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) As stated above, the Commonwealth, through the Department of Administrative Services proposes to release the Malabar Rifle Range for alternative urban land uses and does not intend abandoning the land. However, in 1988 the NSW Rifle Association Incorporated was successful in its application for an injunction preventing the Commonwealth from disposing of the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 22 July 1994 the court issued a decision supporting the Government's proposal that the Association vacate Malabar Rifle Range. The Association has appealed this decision, and that is still to be heard in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's future actions and associated costs are therefore contingent on the outcome of this appeal process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) Establishment costs for the Holsworthy shooting complex are the responsibility of the NSW Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) The Department of Defence is not making any contribution and it is planned the land transfer will take place on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. I am advised that the NSW Government undertook a thorough review of potential sites prior to the decision of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Bid Ltd to nominate Holsworthy as the preferred Olympic shooting site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) There will be no increase in training costs. The Department of Defence has not used the Malabar facility since 1988 and is not intending to utilise the Holsworthy international shooting complex facilities as they are not designed for ADF training purposes. ADF training will continue to be undertaken on special-to-purpose facilities at Holsworthy and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No, the Department of Defence is not seeking to discourage civilian shooting events and this is demonstrated by making available, for purchase, the 168 hectares of land at Holsworthy for the shooting complex. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Health and Medical Research Council issued the report `Cyclodiene Insecticide Use in Australia' in November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report refers to studies exploring health concerns and states `The conclusion from these studies is that the available epidemiological studies, although limited, do not indicate any adverse effects as a result of cyclodiene exposure.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Overall, the cyclodiene termiticides are highly effective low-cost agents and with no currently recognisable adverse human health effects at the present levels of exposure. However, the compounds are environmentally widespread and persistent, and can lead to bioaccumulation in animal and human tissues. The possibilities of as yet unrecognised effects (including interaction with other chemicals) of these cyclodiene compounds and other environmental or ingested materials, remain unknown. It seems apparent that with time the unrestricted use of cyclodienes would cause unacceptable concentrations to be reached in the environment. It is therefore appropriate to reduce their use to the lowest practicable level to avoid this possibility. Suitable alternative and cost-effective chemical and/or physical methods of termite control could replace the use of cyclodienes altogether.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The source of the figures used by Senator Knowles is unclear. The 1993-94 Budget appropriation for the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer totalled $31.785 million and consisted of $3.45 million for national activities and $28.335 million for payments to the States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Actual 1993-94 expenditure totalled $22.17 million and consisted of $0.995 million for national activities and $21.175 million for payments to the States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underspend of $9.615 million consisted of $7.720 million allocated to the States for screening but not spent, and $1.895 million for open biopsy not performed within the Program in 1993-94. This former amount reflects a shortfall in the number of women screened in the first phase of the Program, which was calculated over the full three years to June 1994 and only adjusted in the last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In their initial plans some States had been found to be overly ambitious in estimating their capacity to develop and deliver services. In their planning the States have made provision for rural screening services and when the Program is fully operational in 1996-97 all women in the target age group should have access to screening under the Program.</PARA>
