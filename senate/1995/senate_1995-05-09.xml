<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, if I may, I would like to thank the Senate for the honour of bestowing this position upon me. It is an office that I have sought and one which I am very pleased to fulfil. I look forward to fulfilling the role, and I undertake to do it to the very best of my ability, with fairness and, hopefully, with good humour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The election has not come about in the normal course. As Senator Crichton-Browne leaves the position that he has held, I am sure all senators will acknowledge the contribution that he has made, and particularly the role that he played in restructuring the Senate committee system. While I am on my feet, I would like to be the first to congratulate Senator Jacinta Collins on her election to this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In taking on the position of Chairman of Committees and Deputy President of the Senate, I think all senators here would know that I leave the position of opposition whip with some reluctance. It is a job that I have enjoyed enormously over the years. I want to acknowledge those I have worked with in the position. I think we have been a fairly happy subset of the Senate and have enjoyed working together. I think of Senator Knowles and Senator Panizza, who have been deputy whips to me since I took on the position in 1987, and Senator Bourne of the Democrats. One could not really call Senator Harradine, Senator Chamarette and Senator Margetts whips, but they were always there and one could not ignore their presence; at various times they became part of the group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly thank Senator Tambling, Senator Bjelke-Petersen, Senator Brownhill and Senator O'Chee, who have been National Party whips during this time. I thank most particularly Senator Jones. He and I have had a very good and happy working relationship. I think we came to understand each other and knew when which words meant what, and when silence meant something else. Gerry, I have enjoyed working with you. I shall miss the contact we have had and I have had with those who have been supporting you over the years that you have been whip. I can see Senator Faulkner over there; he has risen to great heights. There is also Senator McKiernan, who fulfilled the position for three years, I think, and more recently Senator Foreman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whip's office is not one that people take much notice of, and it certainly has no profile outside the building. But for those who have been privileged to be a part of that small group, it has been a very happy relationship; so has working with the various parliamentary liaison officers, who are also an important part of the whips group. I thank the Senate for this honour, and I look forward to fulfilling the position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know I speak for all government senators when I very warmly congratulate Senator Reid on her appointment as Deputy President and chair, or chairperson, of committees. History having now been made&mdash;Senator Reid's appointment to this position makes it the first time that a woman has held it&mdash;perhaps the time has come to formally adopt the name `Chair of Committees' rather than `Chairman of Committees' in recognition of that appointment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reid is in the unique position of having been chosen by the Commonwealth parliament itself in 1981, after Senator Knight's death, and she has been re-elected to the Senate on five occasions so far&mdash;a feat which not many senators are likely to emulate, let alone surpass; not that I think Senator McMullan, from the ACT as well, will be letting any grass grow under him in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reid was elected, as she has acknowledged, deputy government whip in 1982-83 and has been opposition whip from 1983, in one capacity or another. It is a very long period of service to a party, and to the Senate more generally. We fully anticipate that Senator Reid will carry out her new functions with the same commitment and sense of responsibility that she has always displayed in her whip's duties. I can very accurately say that Senator Reid is popular on all sides of this chamber for her personal qualities of warmth, charm and humanity, and we fully expect those qualities to be even more consistently and publicly on display in her new role. We wish her all the best and we expect nothing less than that from her in that new job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take this opportunity to express appreciation for the services of the former Deputy President, Senator Noel Crichton-Browne. I said at the time of Senator Crichton-Browne's appointment in August 1993 that I had always considered him to be above the political fray in this place&mdash;whatever might be the case elsewhere&mdash;and I looked forward to him exercising his responsibilities as Deputy President with not only, as I said, efficiency and dispatch, but also wisdom, judgment and even-handed good humour. I can say again quite honestly that, during his tenure in the office, Senator Crichton-Browne displayed amply all those characteristics. I think we all regret the circumstances that have led to him leaving the position and we wish him well for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition, I also warmly congratulate Senator Reid on her election today. I thank non-opposition senators for the fact that they have been prepared to endorse her without a contest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Reid brings many qualities to this position&mdash;not only, of course, that she was a South Australian, brought up in South Australia and educated there; not only because she is a legal practitioner, and we all recognise the benefit of that in effective legislative practice; not only because she has given a lifetime commitment to politics and to her political party&mdash;I think she was a Young Liberal president some little time ago&mdash;not only because she is a competent legislator; and not only because she has a particular interest in helping build the parliaments of the South Pacific, an interest which she will be able to pursue in her new role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support her today, firstly, because of her commitment to this institution, which we regard as vitally important. She has demonstrated, through her work on the Procedures Committee, the Department of the Senate committee, the Selection of Bills Committee and all such bodies, a commitment to this institution. We support her because of her commitment to the effective and efficient working of the Senate, and we have seen that in her many years as whip and as deputy whip. We also support her for her sometimes forgotten commitment to the people other than the politicians who work in this place. They will be very pleased to learn of her election today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> She is also, of course&mdash;and I need not remind honourable senators of this&mdash;a woman. She has not been put up by us because of the fact that she is a woman; nevertheless we are proud that we have made a little bit of history today in putting her forward to the Senate for election and she being elected the first woman Deputy President of this place. We know that she will be objective and fair in her work. We also know that she will be firm but, as I said, she will exercise that firmness in a fair way. We congratulate Senator Reid and wish her well in her post. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I also want to make mention of Senator Crichton-Browne's contribution. We regret the circumstances that have led us to this election here today. We recognise that Noel has made a decision in the interests of his party and we appreciate that fact. We understand that it has nothing to do with the way in which he conducted himself in the office of Deputy President, which was in a way of which I think all senators can be proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reid mentioned his contribution to helping to strengthen and further develop the committee system in this place and that will be part of his legacy, as will the way he conducted himself in the chair. He was always well-briefed, fair and prepared to take on the difficult issues in this place. I think he can retire from the position, not having held it for long, but nevertheless in a position to be proud of the contribution that he has made. I wish to have recorded my appreciation of that contribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Democrats I, too, congratulate Senator Reid. We have great confidence that she will bring to the office of Deputy President the sorts of qualities that most of us know from her in this chamber as whip but also from her membership of various committees. I have had the pleasure of serving with her on various committees. I think we know that she is always open to argument and discussion and that she is a direct communicator. As others have said, she is a warm and cheerful person and I think that those qualities, along with fairness, are qualities that she will probably need to draw upon quite often in future months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I congratulate the Liberal Party, too, for proposing for the position of Deputy President of the Senate a woman who has been elected as the first woman to hold that position. Perhaps in a different situation the Democrats might have seen themselves in that position as well. We wish you well, Margaret. Might I take this opportunity to say we look forward to a continuation of a productive relationship with the new opposition whip, Senator Panizza, whose relationship and sparring with us goes back many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is history that the Democrats voted against Senator Crichton-Browne the first time he was the Liberal nominee; and the reasons for that were clearly articulated at the time. I want to close this phase by saying that, since his election as Deputy President, Senator Crichton-Browne has fulfilled that role in a very capable way with a wonderful balance of judicious use of humour and very fair application of the standing orders. The point we made at the time of our opposition has now been addressed and I want to put on the record that we were very happy with the fair and competent way in which he exercised his role as Deputy President. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Party members of the Senate congratulate Senator Reid on her elevation to the position of Deputy President. The National Party took no part in the ballot, but we had a meeting while the Liberals were having their meeting and we endorsed unanimously Senator Reid's taking this position. I assure her that she has our full support and our best wishes. Senator Reid was the coalition whip when I came to this place in 1983. I warn the Senate that she is no pushover. She can be very firm and we cannot take her for granted in any way. But she is a warm and friendly person and I am sure she will do her job in a very fair manner.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also congratulate Senator Reid on her accession to the position of chair of committees. There were two things she said that need a little clarification. The first, as I got it down, was that she said the whips office is one that people do not take a great deal of notice of. I point out that that does not include those who count; they certainly take a lot of notice of it. I have noticed that when Senator Reid cracks the whip people certainly take a great deal of notice of what she says.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing she said which may need clarification concerned Senator Chamarette, Senator Margetts and me. She said that perhaps the word `whip' would not apply to us. We have been involved in discussions in order to see that this place is run in an orderly way. Those discussions have been with Senator Reid and Senator Gerry Jones. Senator Reid, you might think that being whip of a party is an onerous task; but to be the whip of an individual who has to explain to all and sundry why he voted in a particular way on a particular bill does require some degree of discipline. It may not be terribly obvious to all concerned in this place, but I would like to be regarded as one of the whips. However, I do not expect the Remuneration Tribunal to pay me higher duties for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to have Senator Reid, a person with experience, a pleasant character, legal training and tenacity, as chair of committees. The Committee of the Whole functions are supposed to be performed by the Friday legislative committees of the Senate. It may not be known to everybody, but some of us know that funding for these committees&mdash;and perhaps for the whole committee system&mdash;is under attack. This is not the time to debate that point but Senator Reid, with her strength of character and ability to put forward a very good argument, may be very handy. I am sure that she will be a great asset to you, Mr President, in your very fine work in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I look forward to working with Senator Panizza, who I understand is taking over as the whip. I also look forward to working with Senator Calvert, from the state of Tasmania, who I have been told is to be deputy whip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate Senator Jacinta Collins on her accession. `Accession' is not the right word. I congratulate her on her appointment to this place. Accession presupposes some going up of the ladder. I do not know whether that is the case for all of us. I look forward to her contribution to this Senate and to its committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have found Senator Noel Crichton-Browne to be absolutely fair in his work as Chairman of Committees. Like others, I regret the circumstances that have led to his decision, but I wish him all the best. I do not think he needs that, because he is a person of a good deal of strength. Nevertheless, I place on record my appreciation of his services in that particular office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Margetts and I also wish to congratulate our new Deputy President and chair of committees. Her abilities and good qualifications for this position are well known to those of us who have worked with her in her capacity as opposition whip and in any other capacities. I commend her predecessor, Senator Crichton-Browne, for standing aside from this position. I also wish to acknowledge that we have always found him fair and just in his conduct and in his carrying out of this role. We express our appreciation for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome with great pleasure Senator Jacinta Collins as a colleague in this place. We do so with mixed feelings, because I think there is great sadness that she is replacing our respected colleague Senator Olive Zakharov. But we are thrilled that she has been replaced by a woman and by someone who, I am sure, will contribute a great deal to this place. Finally, while there is no doubt that our Deputy President has gained her position because of her abilities and not for her gender, it is with great pleasure that we acknowledge she has made history by becoming the first woman to take the role of Deputy President of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I remind the minister that this government solemnly promised the Australian people at the last election that it would not put up taxes; it would not introduce new taxes; it would abolish tax for all pensioners; and it would allow personal use of accumulated superannuation for home loans. It even legislated tax cuts to reinforce its promise. All of these promises it has broken and, worse, it seems never intended to keep. What credibility does this government claim when it puts down a budget tonight to the background of such blatant electoral abuse? Why should the people believe the word of Mr Keating, who has demonstrated on so many occasions that he will do or say anything to get elected but will then treat the voters with such scant regard?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Only a few months ago, former Treasurer John Dawkins admitted to deceiving the Australian people by deliberately understating estimates of revenue from indirect taxes in the 1993 budget. Last night we had former Labor staffer and Treasury secretary Tony Cole confirming that the One Nation forecasts were deliberately fiddled in the Prime Minister's office, obviously on directions from the Prime Minister himself. In these circumstances, on the very day when the l-a-w tax cuts are set to become the l-i-e tax cuts, why should Australians believe anything the government says or promises in tonight's pre-election budget?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, it seems that hell hath no fury like a former departmental secretary scorned. Be that as it may, I am advised that the forecasts for the One Nation statement in early 1992 were fixed in exactly the same way that all economic forecasts are that feed into the budgetary processes or statements of this kind. Those forecasts are fixed&mdash;and I use the word in its ordinary, proper meaning&mdash;as a result of the deliberations of the JEFG, as it is called, the Joint Economic Forecasting Group, which is a group of senior Treasury officials and other key departmental officials sitting with the Prime Minister's and the Treasurer's economic advisers of the day. That is the way in which those forecasts have always been struck. That is the way in which they were struck on this particular occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forecast for the period 1992-93 was agreed to be appropriately set at something over four per cent, without apparently much disagreement at all as between the advisers. In the event, of course, for 1992-93, that forecast was not met because the growth outturn was only of the order of 2.5 per cent. But there were plenty of other people who got that particular year's forecast wrong around the world, including the OECD, the IMF and a number of other international forecasters who had to progressively revise down their forecast for growth. That was the case for us as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is important to appreciate is that the outyear forecasts as published in that 1992 One Nation statement&mdash;and they are all there in the document and I will remind you of them in a moment; over which forecasts there was apparently some lively discussion bordering on, one might almost say, disagreement within the JEFG&mdash;were either broadly achieved or, in fact, exceeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 1993-94, the One Nation forecast was 4.5 per cent; in fact, the achieved rate was 4.2 per cent. For 1994-95, the current year, the forecast rate was 4.25 per cent in One Nation. The outturn for this year, when announced, will be, we expect, in the range of 4 1/2 to five per cent. For next year, 1995-96, the One Nation forecast set by this particular group about whom Mr Cole is talking was 3.75 per cent, and our present forecast for 1995-96 is exactly the same figure&mdash;3.75 per cent. So anyone who suggests that those One Nation figures were in any way pumped or inflated or the product of any kind of deliberate fabrication is simply getting their facts wrong. It does not represent the circumstance; it does not represent the process that was at work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I think there is one final general point that also needs to be acknowledged; that is, figures of this kind are not the property of any particular officials within any particular department; they are the government's figures. The government has ownership of them. The government assumes responsibility for them. When the government gets those figures wrong, we expect to get the blame. When the government gets the figures right, we expect to&mdash;even though we never do&mdash;get the applause as a government because we accept the responsibility, we make the judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see how few of you have been interested in chasing down the personal officials who may have been responsible for last year's budget figures, for example, when we underestimated in our forecast growth; we underestimated employment growth; we underestimated investment growth; and we overestimated inflation. Where did we hear from you then in terms of the accuracy of that particular process and who was to be responsible for it? The point is that forecasting is an inexact science which represents a balance of inputs from a variety of sources. It is done in the best possible way that we or any other government can do, and that is what was done on this occasion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Colston for his question because the return of the boat people to southern China is indeed critical to the government's continuing efforts to protect the integrity of its humanitarian program. If we are to continue to offer people in fear of persecution in their homelands a chance to build new lives in Australia as refugees, it is important that we ensure that our policies and programs are not compromised by illegal boat arrivals to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My visit to China last month was extremely successful in this respect. Whilst discussions had been continuing in a very constructive way since the end of last year, direct contact with Chinese officials at national and local levels was invaluable in terms of finalising the arrangements which had to be made for the Chinese authorities to continue to offer protection to these refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Colston noted, it was agreed that the first group would be returned to China during May. I am pleased to inform the Senate that a group of 53 people left Port Hedland this morning. That group is scheduled to arrive in Nanning in southern China in a couple of hours time. Today's departure was incident free. It is the first of what is planned to be a regular movement back to China of those who arrived in Australia over the last six months or so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say, Mr President, that the approach taken by the Australian government was based on a recognised need for cooperation with the Chinese authorities. We have moved with quiet determination to develop a practical, workable and sustainable response, which at times required patience and resolve, and today's departure represents the first dividend of our approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators will recall that on 30 September last year I announced a number of measures in response to this issue, including senior level discussions. Those discussions produced a memorandum of understanding on 25 January this year. The MOU covered the return of these people to China and their continued protection. On 9 February this year the parliament passed legislation which declared China a safe third country for Vietnamese refugees previously resettled in China. Both the MOU and the subsequent legislation were supported publicly by the UNHCR, which organisation has been closely involved with the Vietnamese since they were resettled in southern China in the early 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that we still have a way to go before all the illegal arrivals covered by the MOU and the legislation are returned to China. There will almost certainly be other illegal arrivals, but the important thing is that we have now put in place the framework for a workable response. The return of the group today gives some practical substance to that response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect I must thank the Chinese authorities, which have been most cooperative from the beginning. I also thank the Chinese ambassador to Australia. In less than five months we have negotiated an agreement with China, we have passed the required legislation and we have seen the first lot of boat people returned. That is a remarkable achievement: even more so when it is compared with the time that it took for similar arrangements to be put in place by Hong Kong and Japan, which countries took some 18 months or so to achieve similar results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must thank Senator McKiernan and Jackie Watkins for their assistance in China; the departmental officers for their work here and in China, particularly secretary Chris Conybeare and assistant secretaries Dennis Richardson and Mark Sullivan; and our ambassador in Beijing.

We will remain open to assist record levels of refugees when they come here, but we are not open to illegal migration.</PARA>

I note President Chirac's strong commitment to further developing the French nuclear arsenal in clear breach of France's obligation under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, whereby it is supposed to wind back its nuclear forces. Can it be said that the minister has supported France's nuclear interests and those of the other nuclear powers in arguing for their nuclear privileges to be extended indefinitely at the current NPT review conference? Is not the fact that President Chirac is considering the resumption of nuclear testing just kicking sand in the face of Australia's support? Did the minister underestimate French resolve?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that France, Britain and China, three nuclear powers, have not gone as rapidly down the path of actual disarmament and destruction of nuclear weapons as has been the case with the United States and Russia, which have embarked, under the START I and START II treaties, on a very substantial process of eliminating nuclear stockpiles. The starting points for the stockpiles of the three smaller nuclear powers is very much smaller than those of the other two. That is one of the reasons why they have been dragging their feet somewhat. Nonetheless, they are under real pressure from all of us at the nuclear non-proliferation conference to make serious commitments in that respect. I hope and believe that they will be honoured. Indeed, it is to be expected that there will emerge from the NPT conference in New York a pretty clear declaration of obligations in this respect so far as all the nuclear weapons states are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as nuclear testing is concerned, we have made our position absolutely clear on the record. In my case, I did so yesterday in a statement, following discussions I had with foreign minister Juppe a couple of weeks ago in France. On all predictions, he is likely to be the prime minister of France in the new government and will have a continuing influence in this respect. We have made very clear over and again our opposition to any resumption of testing by France in the South Pacific or anywhere else. We hope very much that that testing will be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chirac administration and its key spokesmen, including the new president himself, will remain studiously non-committal on the subject of the resumption of tests, making the point that they want to keep their force modernised and serviceable. They need some kind of testing, whether by way of actual explosions or simulation, to enable that to occur. They say that they are not wedded to testing by way of underground explosions but will take advice on whether the same results are achievable through simulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only hope that at least that result will be the case. There is some chance that it may, because the French are very conscious of the number of countries not only in this region but around the world that are urging them to play a responsible leadership role in this respect. They do not want France to just go down the path of looking inwardly and self-consciously at its own interests but rather at the larger interests of a world that wants to see genuine nuclear disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any kind of testing designed to keep a stockpile intact or modernised would be anathema to Senator Kernot, as she has indicated in her question. I can perfectly well understand that result. However, I hope she agrees with me that at least the avoidance of outright testing in Mururoa Atoll through explosions is a significant start. We hope that from at least that beginning it will follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond that, I say again for the record that Australia has enjoyed very warm and productive relations with France in recent years. We certainly look forward to maintaining that relationship with the Chirac presidency. We have every confidence that France, under its new administration, will play a positive and responsible role not only on the non-proliferation issue and, hopefully, in the context of the ongoing discussions about a comprehensive test ban treaty, in which its role is extremely important, but also in a whole variety of other policy issues in which we have a major interest, not least in the South Pacific.</PARA>

The government originally predicted benefits to Australia from our signing the Uruguay Round of GATT of $5.5 billion after five years, despite being unwilling to conduct a complete sector-by-sector analysis to check those broad predictions. Whilst it is true that our exports are growing, did these predictions also make allowance for the huge and inevitable increase in imports that are now so evident? Given recent World Bank reports that even the predictions of benefits to the agricultural sector may be illusory and that the World Bank has noted that, for the EU, Japan and the US, agricultural protection may not drop as a result of the choice of base year and `dirty tariffication', how can the government justify the level of sacrifices exacted from many value added industries, including those processing primary commodities for the local market?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fatal flaw in the first part of Senator Margetts's article is that there have been no reductions in tariffs driven by the Uruguay Round for Australia. We made our decisions about our domestic arrangements concerning protection in advance of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round for domestic reasons&mdash;domestic reasons which I agree with and Senator Margetts does not. That is a perfectly proper matter of difference on public policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To pretend that those things which preceded it were caused by it does not add to the analysis of the outcome of the Uruguay Round. There is a well-known logical fallacy:  sometimes you can say that because one thing follows another it is caused by it. In this instance we got a unique version of it: because something preceded something it might somehow or other have been caused by it. I do not understand that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You then come to a more important issue, which is the publicity concerning the World Bank report claiming that the benefits to Australian agriculture from the Uruguay Round would be less than the ABARE analysis in Australia. In many ways we welcome that World Bank report. The message it sends to the major agricultural-distorting economies&mdash;the United States, the European Union and Japan&mdash;is that the process of agricultural reform globally is far from over. What took place as a result of the Uruguay Round was merely a welcome first step, but there is still a long way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distinction between the analysis the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has made and that made by the World Bank is that ABARE took into account additional important benefits to Australia such as market access, which was not part of the analysis made by the World Bank. It took into account the fact that, as from this year, we will be able to export rice to Japan and Korea. It took into account the fact that we will be able to export hundreds of millions of dollars worth of beef to the United States over and above that which we could previously do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So those are things which the World Bank assessment, because it was a global assessment, was unable to take into account, but they are of enormous benefit to Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should, frankly, acknowledge that in this context it is not really helpful to distinguish between evidence on and off the public record. What matters is what Iran's behaviour actually is and what the Australian government can do, if anything, to influence it. There certainly has been longstanding high-level Iranian government support for organisations like Hezbollah and Hamas, intense opposition expressed to Israel and the Middle East peace process and little respect shown for the human rights of political and religious dissidents. The Australian government has found these positions deeply unpalatable and has consistently said so. We also remain concerned about Iran's intentions in relation to the acquisition of nuclear and chemical weapons capability. But our generally cordial relationship with Iran and the strong trade and commercial links between our two countries have put us in a strong position to maintain a much more direct and critical dialogue with the Iranians on these issues than would otherwise have been possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

But available evidence of a direct Iranian role, as distinct from the role of Iran-supported organisations, and evidence of direct high level government support for such attacks, has been extremely limited. In the event that more such evidence were to be forthcoming and, in particular, any evidence suggesting any change for the worse in Iranian behaviour, we would obviously have to reconsider our position on the whole bilateral relationship.</PARA>

They say that, as the highest priority, the best way they would like to see sick children dealt with&mdash;in particular, their own sick children&mdash;is in the familiar place that those children know best, their home.

In pairing science and technology capability with research and development capability, you drive economic growth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures show that in 1992-93 Australia's aggregate spending on research and development had risen to $6.3 billion, an increase of 16 per cent in real terms in just two years. As a percentage of GDP, our R&amp;D spending now stands at an all-time high of 1.56 per cent, an improvement on a figure of about one per cent in the early 1980s when the coalition was in power.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1980s, Australia's gross expenditure on R&amp;D as a proportion of GDP ranked us No. 16 on the OECD table.

We have jumped ahead of nations such as Canada and New Zealand and are reeling in fairly quickly the United Kingdom which, in fact, has seen a decline&mdash;and a significant one&mdash;in overall expenditure on research and development, obviously reflecting the attitudes of a conservative government and the sorts of economic policies pursued in the United Kingdom that have sabotaged the very fine reputation that nation has enjoyed as a site for high science and technology and for research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expenditure on research and development in Australia over the relevant period has grown faster than in any other OECD country. It reflects that we have the fastest growth of any OECD country in the registration of patents. That reflects a growing innovation culture in Australia and a growing recognition in our private sector of the strength of our basic long-term fundamental scientific research. It also reflects the beginning of a wedding between the private sector short-term applied research and the long-term fundamental capability that Australia has as a leading science nation in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at public sector expenditure on research and development in the OECD table, one sees that Australia, which was formerly ranked seventh, is now ranked fourth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction.

Could he inform the Senate as to what action the government intends taking on this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that a number of small independent retail traders in recent times in the Hunter Valley have raised with the government the difficulties they face in competing with large supermarkets, particularly where the large supermarkets are engaged in a price war to increase their own market share.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Issues, of course, such as planning approvals and extended trading hours, are state matters and local government matters and are not within the constitutional power of the federal government. However, one area in which the Commonwealth government does have responsibility is the Trade Practices Act and whether the activities of supermarkets contravene the powers under the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, section 46 of the act prohibits misuse of market power and section 51AA prohibits corporations from engaging in unconscionable conduct&mdash;conduct that is unconscionable within the meaning of the unwritten law of Australia's states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of some particular practices of supermarkets in the Hunter region in the issue of market power, the TPC found no evidence to suggest other than legitimate competitive market conduct. The TPC found that there was intense competition between major supermarkets and that this was having a fallout on the smaller players. Of course, I do not think anybody here would oppose fair and vigorous competition in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in this context, I think senators would recall that some years ago in the early 1990s, the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act were amended and strengthened and this is being looked at by members of the small business forum and the small business coalition in Australia, to see whether these new powers of unconscionable conduct can be used by small businesses to protect themselves from the activities of large corporations&mdash;for example, supermarkets active in the Hunter Valley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under my suggestion at the end of last year the small business forum established a subcommittee to look at whether they could find cases that the TPC could take on on behalf of small business to test the unconscionable conduct powers. That subcommittee of the small business forum, representing 31 small business organisations, reported back to the small business forum and to myself, saying that contrary to the expectations at the time, they believe that the present power of unconscionable conduct, even as amended&mdash;only some three years ago&mdash;is extremely limited in its application and is not addressing the problem as small business sees it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The working party recommends that section 51AA be amended to broaden its application and provide redress for small business. I have asked the working party on behalf of the small business forum, the 30-odd small business organisations, to indicate whether the small business organisations they represent themselves would publicly support such an amendment to the Trade Practices Act on unconscionable conduct, which I have no doubt would be a matter of some controversy in the business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am now receiving indications that a number of small business organisations would support such a change, but other organisations are doubtful about supporting that change. However, when I get the full report and response from the small business forum, the government will then consider that report and how much support there is in the small business community for such a change to strengthen unconscionable conduct to help small business in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;With respect to the answer to question No. 2094 given by the Minister representing the Attorney-General, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), I note that, following my advice to the minister's office today that I was going to ask him why he had not provided an answer to my question on notice regarding Operation Wallah, what he described in writing and again a moment ago as an interim answer was provided to my office just prior to 2 o'clock this afternoon. That answer was to the effect that the Australian Federal Police assessment of alleged Commonwealth offences involving matters referred from the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission's Operation Wallah was almost complete and that when that matter was finalised he would be in a better position to provide comprehensive answers to my questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point to the minister that there is no provision in the procedural orders for an interim answer. The procedural orders simply provide for an answer to be given or for an explanation to be given as to why an answer has not been given. I ask the minister whether what he describes as an interim answer is an explanation as to why I have not received an answer to my question on notice. If it is intended to be an explanation, I have to say that it is an entirely unsatisfactory one because in no way does the question I placed on notice go to the detail of the alleged Commonwealth offences that are supposedly being assessed by the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I put on notice is about the procedures and briefings which have occurred between the Australian Federal Police and other law enforcement agencies, between those agencies and ministers, and so on, prior to this assessment commencing. There is no justification for the minister delaying a full reply to my question until after this Australian Federal Police assessment of alleged Commonwealth offences has been completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no necessity for that assessment to be completed before the minister can provide me with an adequate answer to the question I have put on notice. In fact, the information ought to be available to him now. He has had a month to provide the answer. He is simply abusing the procedures of the Senate by providing what he describes as an interim answer rather than a full and complete answer to my question. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you want me to list the questions for you, Senator Bolkus, so that even you can see your response is not relevant to the question that was asked? The nature of the question that was asked by Senator Chapman was: what are the specific dates on which the initial briefings involving the Criminal Justice Commission, the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority took place, as identified by the minister in the reply to question on notice No. 1887? Why does that require some form of judicial inquiry before the answer can be given? These are matters within the province of the minister. He has the information at hand, and he is simply refusing to put it before the Senate. Why is he refusing to answer this question? We would not have had even this feeble attempt at an explanation if Senator Chapman had not said that he was intending to raise it today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It relates to all parts of the question. The second part was: who was involved in these briefings? Does that require a special inquiry? Why did the CJC advise the AFP and the NCA of its inquiries relating to Operation Wallah if the information provided did not disclose to the Commonwealth agencies the commission by any person of any Commonwealth offences? We understand the sensitivity of these matters, but that does not justify the minister in avoiding his responsibility to answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth part of the question was: what is the specific date that the AFP and the NCA were first advised, either formally or informally, of allegations relating to possible Commonwealth offences involving the Queensland Operation Wallah investigation? What were the possible Commonwealth offences that were identified? Who received this advice and where did the briefing take place? Who provided this advice to the Commonwealth authorities and how was this advice communicated? And so I could go on. Why can't the minister answer these questions and why shouldn't he be obliged to answer these questions? He is the only minister in this place who believes, in fact, that he can just draw a line through a question that has been asked and not have any responsibility to answer it. That is totally unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Senate is going to have any authority at all and if there is ever going to be any executive responsibility to the parliament, this Senate has to enforce its provisions. It has to require the minister to answer questions. There is no point at all in having a process for putting questions on notice if the minister is simply going to refuse to answer them. What is the point of having a standing order that requires an answer within 60 days if the minister is simply going to be able to come into this place and say, `There is a third party inquiry taking place'&mdash;irrelevant to the question that was asked&mdash;`and until that has completed its process, I am not going to answer your questions'? One suspects, of course, that he does not want to answer these questions until after the next election. One, therefore, has to ask the question: what is the government seeking to hide in this matter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chapman is certainly justified in bringing this matter before the Senate today, and it is our responsibility to not allow the minister to get away with his attempt to avoid his responsibility. We will continue to pursue it&mdash;we will pursue it in estimates; we will pursue it here in the chamber. We will move the appropriate resolutions, if necessary, in this place. Senator Faulkner, who is so interested in his program, ought to take note that we will pursue it during the course of this session of the parliament. He is already in trouble for having too much business on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, and he will have to answer for the fact that more of the government's time is going to be taken up&mdash;Senator Faulkner, have you noted this?&mdash;by the failure of his ministers to meet their ministerial responsibilities to the parliament. I hope he will go back and have a quiet chat with Senator Bolkus and tell him that this parliament expects better of him than what he has delivered today. </PARA>

I do not propose to deal with the internal Liberal Party machinations, as the expression is these days, which no doubt will be dealt with by the party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will come as no surprise to know that I could have indulged myself, as could my wife&mdash;who is in the gallery today&mdash;with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. One of my colleagues appeared on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program and I seem to be the recipient of his comments. No member of our family has agreed to interviews by the popular women's magazines such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Womens' Weekly</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Woman's Day</EMPHASIS> or <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Idea</EMPHASIS>. Representatives of those magazines seemed to think that this is some sort of interesting story for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for our refusal to be interviewed are pretty simple. We are a very private family and we think that this is a very private matter. We do not intend to score votes for ourselves; nor do we seek self-indulgence; nor do we seek sympathy; nor do we seek to make political points. We took the view that this matter should never have been raised, it should never have been used in the way in which it has been used, and it should never, under any circumstances, have led to this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances of my resignation are now a matter of public record. It is not without significance to note that this cheap dirt which was circulated about me came after I attracted&mdash;I might say modestly&mdash;90 per cent of the votes of my colleagues at my preselection.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts of the matter are quite simple and I want honourable senators to reflect upon them for a moment. It was a domestic incident about which nobody has the awareness, the understanding, the knowledge of the circumstances leading up to it, or the manifestation of it. Some 5 1/2 years ago my wife was advised by a lawyer to seek a restraining order. When she understood the implications of the restraining order, and when she had time for a moment of reflection, she promptly had it withdrawn. It was never served on me and it was never enforced. It was ex parte and it was simply nothing more than a piece of paper. But, as a result of that, I stand before the Senate as an ex-deputy president. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, for reasons best known to itself&mdash;they are pretty well known to most of us&mdash;runs campaigns against certain individuals. I happen to be one of them. Today's paper describes me as a wife basher. People who know the facts, the circumstances, the incident, the occasion and the events would want to vomit upon reading it. That is the reason for my resignation from the deputy presidency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek not to be melancholy, but there is a matter I have to touch upon. The day the dirt sheet was distributed was the day I was in Geraldton with my wife burying her father. The disclosure of the matter by a senior Liberal lawyer, who was indirectly involved in the matter, is another matter. No doubt another forum will contemplate it. But that is not my business; it is the business of other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a uniquely private matter for our family, as were the circumstances leading up to it and the family's involvement in it. This resignation raises the question of what are private affairs of people and families and what is of public interest. When a circumstance in my private family that was resolved and reconciled 5 1/2 years ago&mdash;we have always been a close family, however we lead our lives&mdash;ventures into the public arena, others will have to deal with it. Reconciliation and a sense of warmth, growth and strength can occur in a family after it resolves a matter which arose because of unique circumstances. If once it is resolved and satisfied it becomes a matter of public indulgence to be commented upon by the press and parliamentarians, that begs a whole range of questions. </PARA>

However, there are certain matters upon which a number of us have had knowledge for a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no secret that I have always attacked the arguments and policies and not the personalities.

There was also another occasion recently&mdash;I am sure that my other colleagues will not mind telling the Senate about it&mdash;when I argued with some passion that we should not be attacking one Labor Party person about a matter which I did not believe related to his duties and responsibilities. </PARA>

If we are in that game, we are no better than second-hand car salesmen. I hope that I do not offend them by saying that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, in essence I have felt very touched and, frankly, very moved by the support I have received from the Labor Party, from a number of its ministers and from the Democrats on this matter. Their judgment was that this was not a matter visited upon me in respect of my contribution as a senator, as the Deputy President of the Senate and&mdash;our god willing, Mr President&mdash;maybe as the President of the Senate. I want to make sure that that is clearly understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This attack does not have universal appeal. This rather unsavoury salivation by the press is not just a burden for me but it has been a torment and a torture for my wife and three innocent, pristine children. The question I ask, not in a rhetorical sense, is: what has been the sin that they have committed which has required them to carry this particular burden? They were not privy to my decision to enter parliament, save for one, I think. Perhaps we had two children at the time; I cannot remember. They did not have a say in my decision to enter parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My wife said to me recently, `Noel, I never wanted you to go into parliament, but you never really consulted me. I just took it that that was what you wanted to do and it was my responsibility to allow you to fulfil the obligations you felt you had to both the Liberal Party and the wider community.' I do not seek to protect myself behind my family, but this begs the question as to what is a public matter and what is a private matter. </PARA>

Do I make an issue as to whether or not one of my colleagues happens to be a lesbian? Do I make an issue as to whether or not members of the press gallery are having affairs with ministers of state or with members of the frontbench of the opposition? Are they issues that go to the heart and touch upon your capacity and ability to discharge responsibilities and duties? I do not know, but it is important that we ask ourselves the question as to what is a public matter and what is a private matter. It seems to me that we are going down the road of the American system, where much of what is raised has absolutely nothing to do with one's character, ability, responsibility or capacity to discharge one's responsibilities but is simply idle, dirty gossip for the sheer fun and fascination of a public which will always find such matters inviting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For me, entering the Senate and entering parliament was simply an utter indulgence of my own. It gave no financial benefit to my family. I can tell you that it has cost them an absolute fortune. It has meant that I have spent much of my time away from my family, but it was something I decided to do and something they sacrificed. That is why I raise the question as to what price they have to pay for my having made the decision I did and then being prepared to carry that sacrifice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as we all know these days, altruism is simply seen as a cynical exploitation of personal naked ambition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are and always have been a very private family. I am very tempted not to say this, but I have to tell the chamber something so that senators can understand the level of this debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evangelical Christians these days have a more relaxed attitude about Sunday afternoons but, on that Sunday afternoon, my wife's view was that we should not be involving ourselves, or that she at least should not be going out on a Sunday afternoon to what one might describe as a frivolous social occasion. I insisted we go because it was a fundraising function for Peter Shack. When we came home my son was dead on his bed because his restraining strap had caught him around the throat. He had climbed out of his cot and strangled himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell that story for only this reason. Within the last two weeks somebody in the Liberal Party has suggested to the press that they should go to the Attorney-General's Department and dig out the file on my son's autopsy to see how he really died. There was no inquest, of course; there was an autopsy which Esther and I asked for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of you who have read an autopsy report will understand the trauma that took place in this parliament in the last week of the sittings when Senator Rosemary Crowley was under attack for mistakenly releasing some documents.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell the Senate this for no other reason than for honourable senators to understand the level to which politics is capable of sinking.

I do not want to indulge myself, but I do want to put on public record for the benefit of the family that for 10 years of my life I worked full time in a voluntary capacity for the party. I drew no salary; I drew no costs; I drew no benefits; I drew no rewards. I simply did it because I had a commitment. Coming into parliament was not part of my program; it was not part of my agenda. I simply did it because I thought it was part of the contribution that our family should make. Simple arithmetic will tell you what I was capable of earning and what it cost us as a family over those 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I rang Western Australia to ask what my record was. I was reminded that when I ran the campaign in 1977 Charles Court got 54 per cent of the vote&mdash;the highest vote the Liberal Party had ever recorded. You can tell me there are a thousand reasons why we did it, but there always are when you win. I started the Kalgoorlie North division of the Liberal Party and we held every single seat north of the 26th parallel. I do not know who has been north of the 26th parallel in Western Australia besides Senator Cook and Senator Chris Evans, but it is a pretty hard grind. We held all those seats in areas which might be equated to Mount Isa, Gladstone or Port Kembla because we had the infrastructure on the ground and the capacity, the facility and the ability to win. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1975 we won nine out of 10 seats in WA when I ran the campaign. In 1977 we won nine out of 10 seats in Western Australia when I ran the campaign and we went within 2,000 votes&mdash;as John Dawkins well remembers&mdash;of winning the seat of Fremantle. I do not take any pride in telling the Senate that when I was asked to run the recent Helena by-election in Western Australia, it was the first time since 1951, and the only other occasion since Federation, that a government has won a seat from the opposition. At the last state election, which I had the dubious distinction of also managing, we won 55.4 per cent of the vote&mdash;the highest vote the Liberal Party has ever received in Western Australia. I put those things on the record not for me&mdash;because it does not matter&mdash;but for those people who do care and who do know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I thank you, Mr President, for the support you have always given me and I thank those who have spoken kindly and in an indulging way today. I also thank those who saw fit, whether they be ministers of the Crown or from other political parties, to ring me and ask me not to resign as the Deputy President but to stay in that position because there was no way they would move upon me. I thank my colleagues who voted for me last time and who, presumably, given an opportunity, may have voted for me again. I thank the Senate for its indulgence. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Newman this day, relating to an Australian Quarantine Inspection Service report concerning the importation of salmon to Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA>I draw attention to the fact that the interim risk analysis report by AQIS recommends that wild Canadian and United States salmon be brought into Australia as the risk is negligible. I understand that there is a 60-day consultation process, as does the salmonoid industry. But I am rather concerned about some aspects of this and I think it is important that I put those concerns on the record now. I will certainly make a presentation to the minister some time down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to know that Senator Sherry made a very important point on Sunday when he said that the decision on this matter would be made on scientific grounds. I have no problem with that; but I do have a problem with a draft report being released, it having been said that it is going to be made on scientific grounds, and the industry itself not being able to obtain a copy of the CSIRO report from the division of animal health. This is one of the major reports that AQIS used to bring down the interim risk analysis draft that it has to comment on. I wonder why it has been so secretive about it. The fact that salmonoid growers made an FOI application about this matter makes me wonder why it has not been released for these people to peruse so that they can come forward with better based queries on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABARE report&mdash;another report that was taken into account&mdash;raised the fact that an outbreak of diseases had the potential to wipe out the Tasmanian salmon industry. The CSIRO findings also pointed out that eight major diseases will be present in the gutted, uncooked Canadian salmon that comes in. The fact that that is going to happen, if it is allowed to go ahead, raises alarm bells in this very new and very important industry to Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was quite surprised at the meeting on Sunday when one of the scientific people produced another report by AQIS on its inquiry into ballast water. One of the points that was made in that report was that there were 13 diseases that could come into Australian waters, and it recommended very strict rules to stop that happening. Yet we have another AQIS report which says that it is okay to bring in Canadian uncooked salmon with eight major diseases in it. That is why these questions have to be asked and why the industry has to get all these answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked a question of one of the other scientific people there&mdash;we talk about scientific facts, and I think that is what this decision has to be based on. I asked: how many countries in the world have a disease free status with fisheries? The answer I got was that there were two&mdash;Australia and New Zealand&mdash;and there is now only one in the whole world that has disease free status, Australia. The reason New Zealand has diseases is that it allowed the importation of fish product, obviously a decision based on a report similar to the one that has been released by AQIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should an industry in Tasmania which has been put together by private enterprise over a long period of time with its own risk capital now be put at risk? It has had all the problems one could think of&mdash;bringing a fish from the Northern Hemisphere which it was said would not survive in the south; the fish spent three years in quarantine in New South Wales and was bred from there so that there would be no risk at all of any introduced disease in Australia. The industry is now exporting over $100 million worth of product and is providing in the south of the state something like 2,000 jobs. To place that industry at risk is unacceptable. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Alston this day, relating to government economic forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA>Last night on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> the former Secretary to the Department of the Treasury, Tony Cole, confirmed that the One Nation forecasts were deliberately fiddled in the Prime Minister's office, obviously on directions from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself. That is another example of the lack of credibility that financial markets in Australia suffer. Here we have an example exposed by the former secretary to the department about what actually happened in the past, back in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If we look for external evidence as to how we are regarded by the rest of the world, as I have said to the Senate previously, we have only to look at the 10-year bond  rate in Australia. In Australia we are paying a premium of about two per cent for 10-year bonds. In other words, all households and everyone in business is paying a premium of about two per cent compared to the bond rate in New Zealand or in the USA. This morning the difference between Australia and the USA for 10-year bonds was 2.4 per cent and between here and New Zealand it was 1.6 per cent. In crude terms, over the last few months there has been about a two per cent differential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans claimed that the government has the right to publish its own figures. Of course it has the right to publish its own figures. But surely the parliament and the community deserve to see the figures that have been produced by the Treasury. If the government wants to publish its own figures, that is fine, but it should at least explain what the differences are between what it is putting forward as the appropriate predictions for the economy and what the Treasury says. It should also give the reasons why it differs from the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to 1982, the current Prime Minister, then the honourable member for Blaxland, Mr Keating, in the other place criticised the Treasurer of the time, John Howard. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 10 November 1982 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where do we go in this nation  when the principal Minister of government, responsible for the Department of the Treasury and responsible for the publication of the only document upon which the Australian nation can base some economic judgment, falsifies that document? It is the habit of this nation to have annual Budgets and Budget statements prepared by the premier department of the Government, the Treasury. Where do we go when we find as we did find, that the 1977 Budget was falsified so that the coalition Government could go to an election and offer tax cuts that it knew it could never afford.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in a classic situation this year. We are coming up to an election. There was talk about an election this year when this Budget was framed. This Budget has been regarded by everybody as an election Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>That was his accusation in 1982. Mr Hawke, on the same day, also made the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once they think that there may be an election, truth and morality go out the window and the figures are cooked.</PARA>
<PARA>No wonder we in Australia are paying a premium on bond rates. Basically, international financial markets do not trust government and do not trust us for our fiscal record or our inflation rate record. What do we need to do? We need independently published figures. There has been a start made on this with the publication of the national fiscal outlook but that needs to be done on a regular basis without the government's interference. Let us compare the situation, for instance, with that in the USA, where the congressional budget office puts out independent figures&mdash;as opposed to what the administration puts out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand, just across the Tasman, has set up a regime under its Fiscal Responsibility Act to put out estimates that are guaranteed by the government to be the best estimates by its Treasury and to be without political interference. We need a similar system here so the markets can have faith in the credibility of what comes from government. Perhaps if that were done for some time businesses and households would be paying a lower rate of interest on their loans. It could be up to two per cent lower than we have at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard a regurgitation of the assertions made by the opposition during question time. At that time they were wrapped in the form of a question; they are now wrapped in the form of a direct statement. Neither form is true; both are wrong. Nonetheless, the opposition, which obviously seeks comfort in trying to besmirch the reputation of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and paint him as something he is not, and which seeks comfort as well in any figures it can find&mdash;no matter how arcane they might be&mdash;that reflect in any way on Australia's economic performance, is taking comfort in trying to argue the case that the economy is in bad shape and, therefore, the opposition should be elected to government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a preposterous fallacy, one that anyone who knows anything about the Australian economy would see through instantly. But since the opposition does it constantly, one imagines it is for the reason that if enough mud is thrown at someone, some of it will stick and, therefore, the reputation of the Prime Minister and the efficacy of the economy will be undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program last night. I heard Tony Cole say some things about the forecasted figures in the One Nation statement and I read the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> yesterday by the correspondent who interviewed him. I did not hear Tony Cole saying that the Prime Minister in any way was responsible for changing the figures. That is an allegation made by the opposition; it is not an allegation or a comment made by Mr Cole. It would be refreshing if one debated this matter on a factual basis; not on a basis of allegation or of reputation besmirching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer given by Senator Gareth Evans in question time today was accurate in every respect. There is a body within the Commonwealth government called JEFG, the Joint Economic Forecasting Group. It is a body drawn from a number of Commonwealth government agencies as well as departments, whose job it is to forecast the directions of the economy and to provide advice to the government on what those forecasts are. Traditionally and typically, it forecasts half-yearly and yearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement was not a budget in which the forecasts would have been geared to inform the government. It was a one-off statement made, as I recall, in January or February of 1991. It was made as a countercyclical statement to put growth back into the economy. It worked. The growth figures that we are experiencing&mdash;the decrease in unemployment, the increase in profit share&mdash;show that the countercyclical measures used by the government actually worked. That is not the point of what the opposition raises here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to frame such a document, the government had to turn to estimates of future growth. What JEFG had forecast was in its typical yearly and half-yearly review periods. What the One Nation statement&mdash;falling at an odd time&mdash;required was medium-term forecasts. In order to get a medium-term forecast that JEFG was not geared to provide, on page 120 of One Nation you will find reported to the public at large the committee that assessed the measures being applied in One Nation. Since they were stimulus measures, you also find what additional benefit or growth to economy those stimulus measures would produce. Because you had a regular cycle forecast, you were operating at an odd time. You assembled a body of Treasury, PM&amp;C and ministerial officials to provide the necessary information for the forecasts. That is all reported. It is in the papers of One Nation. If you argue it, have a look at the papers. That is what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was dispute within that committee, but every member of that committee signed off on the recommendation in the end. It is no news to this place that there are disputes in committees; it happens all the time. But the members reconciled themselves, agreed and signed off on it. So let us not have this smear that somehow the Prime Minister involved himself in baking the books. He did not. Anyone who proposes that is not telling the truth. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), to a question without notice asked by Senator Forshaw this day, relating to retail chains and small business.</PARA>
<PARA>This afternoon, Senator Schacht outlined some of the possible measures and some of the ways in which the Commonwealth government might be able to assist small business with its difficulties with chain stores in the Hunter Valley. We have had in this country since the 1950s a growth in chain stores. Until recently, the small businesses of this country have been able to compete successfully. Two things have changed in recent times. One is 24-hour trading, which the small businesses&mdash;often family businesses&mdash;find virtually impossible to compete with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that has changed is predatory pricing. This has come in a disturbing way in many areas of the Hunter, where big chain stores have forced out of business nearby small businesses by reducing prices for a sustained period. When the other small businesses have gone broke, they have gone back to their old pricing systems. The effect of this in an area like the Hunter is quite devastating. We have at the moment one business closing a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very wide range of types of businesses affected by this. Fruit shops, chemists, delicatessens, bakeries, butcheries and take-away food outlets are all being affected by these policies. Recently in the suburb of Mayfield a brand new chain store opened, and the effect on the surrounding shops has been quite devastating. The business that probably finds it most difficult of all to compete with the chains is fresh fruit. Many other businesses, such as pharmacists, can provide specialist services that the chains cannot, but it is difficult in the area of fresh food such as fruit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case I went into this man's fruit shop in Merewether. It was a very big fruit shop; it was a very professionally run business. But the fact was he was losing money in that shop. He supplied the naval ships that went into Newcastle and that was the area from which he got his profit to subsidise his shop. If this man who is such an efficient businessman cannot make a go of it, no wonder one shop a day is shutting in the Hunter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business operators in the Hunter became so concerned about this that they held a meeting recently where 500 people turned up. The local Labor members were not very helpful in their response at that time and so they wrote to Minister Schacht, who is the minister for small business. And this was his reply:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is often a regrettable consequence of major retailers engaging in price wars that smaller businesses cannot compete.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I sympathise with your situation, it would be inappropriate for the Commonwealth Government to establish mechanisms that reduce competition in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would seem that the changing face of retailing, and the move away from specialty stores to large "one-stop" shopping centres that cater for the normal buying needs of the community, has impacted significantly on small businesses. This is regrettable. However, the changes in shopping behaviour are the result of changes in the nature of society, with greater demands for convenience and range to reflect different lifestyles. Unfortunately, it is the larger supermarkets who are best placed to meet these new demands.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very unsympathetic response. Fortunately, since that time and since representations I have made, the minister has been prepared to meet a delegation from the small business people in the Hunter. We believe that they are being targeted as part of a lead campaign which will then spread through the rest of Australia and affect businesses in the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want this minister to sit down with the people of the Hunter who can tell him not only how this is affecting their businesses and their lifestyle but how it is affecting the employment opportunities for young people in a region of high unemployment. I realise that some areas with which this matter is concerned, such as trading hours, are the province of state governments&mdash;and state governments urgently need to look at trading hours. This minister should convene the ministerial council to discuss how these things can be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But within the Trade Practices Commission the minister has more power than he is letting on. Let us see a real attempt to try to improve the situation for small business who do not mind competing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Hill this day, relating to the level of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>The first part of that question stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this government solemnly promised the Australian people at the last election that it would not put up taxes; it would not introduce new taxes; it would abolish tax for all pensioners; and it would allow personal use of accumulated superannuation for home loans. It even legislated tax cuts to reinforce its promise.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Gareth Evans, in his answer to Senator Hill today, completely ignored that question and gave a total non-answer. People need to be reminded of what the government said prior to the last election, the lie of the last election about these particular aspects. I see Senator Cook sitting over there, who, a little while ago, said, `Let's deal with some facts.' I would like to deal with some facts about legislated tax cuts. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . let me tell you something that I thought you might have known&mdash;they've been legislated. They were not promises, they are law&mdash;L-A-W&mdash;law.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how anyone could defend what the Prime Minister did in that particular instance. I do not know how anybody on the other side of the chamber could hold their heads up after what this government did to mislead the Australian public prior to the last election. That is totally beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there were ever very many people on the other side of the chamber who really believed that these so-called legislated tax cuts would be delivered. We all know what happened with them. We know that on 19 November 1992 the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I am promising is not to put up tax.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> as being absolute fact. Since then we have seen increases in sales tax. Tonight we will see an announcement about further superannuation taxes. We are also going to see further increases in the Medicare tax and, no doubt, a number of other things will come to fruition as time goes by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot believe this Prime Minister. We cannot believe what he has delivered to the Australian people in the time that he has been in office. I am sure that the Australian people are in the process of waking up to the fact that a Prime Minister cannot survive on the continuation of a lie. All that has changed is that l-a-w is now l-i-e. But there is more. There was the matching of the Christmas appeal funds. On 6 December 1992 the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So let me say to you, Laurie, that for every dollar that the voluntary agencies like the St Vincent de Paul, the Smith Family, the Salvation Army collect for material assistance, the Commonwealth will match for the Christmas Appeals.</PARA>
<PARA>Once again, a promise not delivered. It was a very simple commitment and, at the time, seemed a very humane commitment but this man has no humanity whatsoever. He promises these sorts of things to win a few votes and get a bit of kudos, then he walks right away from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, he is not the only Labor Minister to do this. I raise the case of the use of superannuation funds for housing and the promise made at the policy launch that Labor would permit part of the deposit on owner occupied dwellings to be funded from the home buyer's superannuation account. What did former Treasurer Dawkins have to say about that? On 16 February 1993, at a Hobart doorstop, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to super for housing, all they are really offering is a lending facility, allowing the super funds to lend for housing to individuals who have accounts with those super funds.</PARA>
<PARA>Another promise not delivered. I have to emphasise that. As we work through these examples, and there are very many of them&mdash;my time has nearly come to an end&mdash;it is clear that the promises and commitments made by this federal Labor government through the Prime Minister are not worth the paper they are written on. We cannot believe them. This government has consistently misled the Australian public and their promises are just the big Keating lie. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I have to admit to the minister that I used that device in the hope that he would take that point of order. The reason I used that device is that in the House of Representatives Mr Hollis was allowed to get away with that kind of abuse of me&mdash;and much worse&mdash;without being called to order, without being required to behave himself, without being required to behave with propriety and without being required to recognise not only the dignity of his own house but also the status of the Senate and the manner in which members of the Senate should be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the second edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, the House of Representatives' own rules require:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Offensive words cannot be used against either the Senate or Senators. It is important that the use of offensive words should be immediately reproved in order to avoid complaints and dissension between the two Houses.</PARA>
<PARA>What I am doing now in my personal explanation is also lodging a very serious complaint about the manner in which senators have been allowed to be insulted in the House of Representatives with impunity&mdash;and not only insulted but insulted in a way which involves the use of false, disgraceful accusations which cannot be substantiated and which have not been substantiated. I start with the actual misrepresentations that went on. Mr Hollis said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Baume&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not `Senator Baume', and I might say that our rules would require the proper use of whatever is the appropriate word before the surname. In our case, when we deal with the House of Representatives, it is Mr or the Hon. or whatever is relevant&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">said publicly and under parliamentary privilege how disgusting that a man who was an invalid pensioner should stand for parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>I said no such thing. This related to something some years ago concerning a state member of parliament who happened to have been an invalid pensioner. I said no such thing. Although it still does intrigue me, I must admit, to know how a man who can claim he is not fit enough to work claims he is fit enough to work as a member of parliament. Do we have lower requirements? That does still strike me as extraordinary. Anyway, I certainly said nothing of the sort. I never said that it was disgusting for a man who was an invalid pensioner to stand for parliament; that is totally false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hollis then accused me of arranging for the local newspaper to put out a scurrilous and false report hinting that he had misappropriated funds from his previous employment. That is totally and absolutely false. I understand that a Nowra newspaper had a story of that nature. Mr Hollis took out an injunction against the newspaper and prevented the story being published. I was fascinated by that fact and subsequently I obtained a copy of that report about which I had previously known nothing. I might mention to Mr Hollis that I then asked one of his former colleagues about this matter, only to find out that funds that Mr Hollis had given himself were retrospectively agreed to by the Workers Education Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hollis also says that he made frequent requests after the election for Senator Baume to publish the story. It was for me to expose myself to the threat of litigation. As it is not my story and I had nothing to do with it, I have no intention of doing so. Mr Hollis has never asked me to do so. It is a total nonsense to say that he had made frequent requests for me to publish it. Mr Hollis goes on:</PARA>

In deference to your suggestion that I do not go on too long about this, Mr Acting Deputy President, Mr Hollis should recognise that many matters of a personal nature could be raised about him. Senator Crichton-Browne has quite properly demonstrated how there should be a clear division between one's private life and one's public activities. I will not go across that boundary.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Remuneration Tribunal Determinations No 30 and No 33 of 1994, made under subsection 7(3AA) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973</EMPHASIS>, which are currently before the Committee. These Determinations concern variations to the recreation leave entitlements of certain office holders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Determination No 30, which varies Determination No 20 of 1991, appears to have taken effect retrospectively from 10 December 1991. Determination No 33 then repeals Determination No 20 of 1991 with effect from 19 December 1994.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 27 February 1995 in which you sought advice on the retrospective operation of Remuneration Tribunal Determination No 30 of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Determination No 30 provides that certain Judicial Registrars of the Family Court accrue recreation leave at the same rate as they were entitled to before the operation of Determination No 20 of 1991 which unintentionally reduced their entitlement. Had the Remuneration Tribunal not made Determination No 30, those Judicial Registrars would have accrued recreation leave at the lesser rate. Therefore, I can confirm that the retrospective operation of Determination No 30 can prejudicially affect no-one other than the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New paragraphs 30A(3)(cc) and 30G(3)(fb) provide that an application for certification must, among other things, state the number of employees covered by the agreement who are included in each of seven classes of person.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sir</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to a letter dated 28 February from the Chairman, the Honourable Senator Mal Colston in respect of Statutory Rules No 464 of 1994, being amendments to the Rules of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee seeks my advice on the legality and appropriateness of the Commission requiring applicants for certified agreements and enterprise flexibility agreements to specify employees beyond the three statutory categories to be found in the Industrial Relations Act 1988, and also on the lack of certainty involved in requiring the identification of other employees whose interests may not have been taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 48 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 enables me, after consultation with members of the Commission, to make rules with respect to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the practice and procedure to be followed in the Commission; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the conduct of business in the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both sections 170MG and 170NG require the Commission to identify "relevant employees" whose interests may not have been sufficiently taken into account in the negotiations for, or the terms of, the agreement. Both sections provide examples of three categories of employees whose interests may not have been taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, subsection 15AD(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides that where an Act includes an example of the operation of a provision, the example shall not be taken to be exhaustive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was evident from the consultation process conducted with members of the Commission that information in respect of the additional categories of employees that the Rules now require was necessary for the Commission to satisfy its obligations under section 170MG in respect of certified agreements and section 170NG in respect of enterprise flexibility agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, the inclusion of specific categories within the Rules would largely ameliorate the very lack of certainty involved in requiring the identification of employees (other than the three examples contained in the statute) whose interests may not have been taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, it was recognised that the Rules could not make reference to each and every category of "relevant employee". For this reason, the Rules continue to require applicants to identify employees who might be "relevant employees" but are not included in the specified classes of employees. Taking into account the additional classes of employees now specified in the Rules, I did not consider it inappropriate that applicants continue to be required to identify other "relevant employees".</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 (the act) is part of a global network of legislation, with the goal of protecting biological diversity and maintaining ecological processes and systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will enhance the extent to which Australia discharges its obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on Biological Diversity. The amendments will provide an improved administrative framework, strengthen measures against illegal wildlife trafficking, and make the Australian Nature Conservation Agency's service to client groups more effective. They will also support a national approach to the conservation of Australia's biodiversity and improve arrangements for regulating the commercial use of wildlife.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments have been developed after extensive consultations with State and Territory governments, industry and non-government organisations and are in accord with the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes have largely arisen from recommendations of the Ley Report which reviewed the act, having particular regard to Australia's obligations under CITES. The proposed amendments will implement Appendix III of CITES, relating to species identified by a Party as under regulation to prevent or restrict exploitation, and needing the co-operation of others in the control of trade. They will also enable a more flexible approach to controlling private non-commercial trade in species identified under Appendix II of CITES, species identified as although not endangered, requiring trade regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of wildlife export industries in Australia are subject to the act, which currently provides for the establishment of management and controlled specimens programs, the development of which are undertaken in close consultation with State and Territory agencies. The amendments will include the requirement that any proposals for the commercial utilisation and international trade in native wildlife are subject to appropriate legislative and regulatory regimes in the relevant State or Territory. Management programs may only be approved where the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories is satisfied that to ensure protection of the species, appropriate regulatory measures, monitoring and assessment procedures are in place for the proposed harvesting activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Management programs will be subject to time limitations, as it is vital that harvesting of wild native plants and animals are reviewed on a regular basis. Therefore, the amendments will establish a maximum period of five years between such reviews, with the flexibility to establish shorter periods, should it be considered necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through the introduction of special conditions for permits for export of native animals under interzoological garden transfer, Australian zoos will be better able to manage their animal populations. The well developed Australasian Species Management Program will be assisted by these measures, which will also facilitate participation in international breeding programs involving endangered species.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The risks of detection and prosecution to those associated with wildlife smuggling will increase as a combined result of improved administrative measures and enforcement efforts. Continuation of co-operative work undertaken by the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, the Australian Customs Service, State and Federal Police, and State wildlife agencies will ensure these changes are effective. Overall, they will improve operating efficiency without compromising the protection of wildlife and the Australian environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposals include improved enforcement powers of inspectors appointed under the act by strengthening powers of seizure, improving powers of search of premises and conveyances, providing powers to conduct frisk searches of suspect persons, enabling seizure of specimens. These provisions are consistent with the Criminal Code Bill 1994 and the recently amended Crimes Act 1914, while taking into account the rights of the individual. Penalties have also been made consistent with Commonwealth policy regarding introduction of penalty units.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the substantial penalties currently available for illegally importing and exporting wildlife, the amendments propose a new offence. Any person illegally importing or exporting live animals may be subject to a potential two year imprisonment term, if found guilty of cruel treatment to the animal. This will ensure that the treatment of the animals involved in such crimes is subject to consideration by the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is also concerned that the establishment of self-sustaining populations of exotic birds in the Australian wild could have disastrous effects on native wildlife populations. Further, it may only take one bird infected with an exotic disease, and which has been smuggled into Australia, to contaminate thousands of aviary held or wild native birds. These are serious risks which require a comprehensive approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A central measure in the bill to addressing these concerns is the introduction of a national exotic bird registration scheme. The scheme was developed along with close consultation with the aviculture industry, bird keepers and the States and Territories. Registration will provide an inventory of exotic birds currently housed in Australia that have environmental or pest potential, and those that are endangered internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A national inventory created under the scheme will provide an agreed list of exotic birds in Australia that will enable for the first time, the means to properly manage exotic birds. Whilst providing a national focus, the proposed amendments allow the States and Territories the flexibility to impose additional measures if they so desire. The scheme will support and assist the legal trade in exotic birds within Australia. The uncertainty and risks associated with the purchase of many birds will be substantially reduced, by eliminating doubt as to the legal origin of the bird.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An advisory committee to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories will be established to examine the ongoing effectiveness of the registration scheme and to provide advice on proposed variations to the list of birds proposed for registration. This committee will comprise of representatives of government, conservation, and private and professional aviculture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Amendment bill also proposes tighter controls on the export of birds as household pets by providing for a limit of two birds that may be taken out of Australia by a person leaving to take up permanent residence overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, through arrangements being developed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, international cooperation to stem the illegal wildlife trade has become more effective. Australia has an excellent international reputation for its positive involvement in conservation issues, and will be further extending its support to other countries in this respect, with the creation of a new offence whereby it will be illegal to import wildlife specimens contrary to the conservation laws of a foreign country, where a breach of the overseas law involves trade with Australia and where the foreign country requests assistance. This will enable Australia to assist with international enforcement of wildlife laws of other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the environmental problems of the globe, which include a range of threats to biodiversity and the survival of many species of wildlife, will only be addressed through national and international cooperative measures. This Government is providing leadership and support in meeting the national and international challenge of protecting biological diversity and maintaining ecological processes and systems. The Wildlife Protection Amendment Bill is a step forward in meeting that challenge and a further example of the Government's commitment to ensuring an ecologically sustainable future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address a side issue raised by Senator Herron. He has pointed out that, under current legislation, it is possible for the funds to contract with the hospitals. They are doing that. They have been doing so for some time in Victoria and also in my home state of South Australia, and the world has not come to an end. Some nonsense is being spread by doctors that this is draconian legislation because we are going to have contracts.

I cannot see what his problem is with the charter and the terms of the information that it will be providing to patients. Not all patients, as Senator Herron acknowledges, will be involved in contracts. They will choose to remain with existing tables and will therefore need additional information. Hopefully, all doctors in their rooms will also tell patients what the gap will be for those who do not elect to insure under the fully contracted tables. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Treasurer (Mr Willis) is delivering in another place his budget speech for 1995-96.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the budget proposals of the government. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this budget has one principal objective: to provide for the continued expansion of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>It will enable the continuation of substantial employment growth, falling unemployment and rising living standards, while reducing pressure on interest rates, inflation and the current account. </PARA>
<PARA>It will do so by tackling the major constraint on growth: the long term decline of our national savings. A higher level of national savings will allow higher levels of investment and economic growth without the costs and constraints associated with undue reliance on the savings of foreigners. </PARA>
<PARA>This budget provides a two-part plan to improve Australia's saving performance, immediately and over the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, it increases public saving. </PARA>
<PARA>The budget delivers a surplus in 1995-96 of $718m. This is a massive turnaround in the budget outcome of $12.9 billion or 2.8 per cent of GDP. It is the largest ever turnaround in the budget outcome. It brings the budget into surplus three years earlier than previously forecast. </PARA>
<PARA>This is achieved by cuts to spending, increases in revenue and asset sales, including part of the proceeds from the sale of the government's remaining equity in the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>Importantly, the budget for 1996-97 will be in surplus excluding asset sales and special debt and capital repayments. </PARA>
<PARA>And the budget surplus by 1998-99 will be $7.4 billion or 1.2 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, the budget will introduce a major increase in private saving in the medium to longer term by the progressive introduction of employee superannuation contributions, with the second round of the One Nation tax cuts paid on a matching dollar for dollar basis into employee superannuation accounts. </PARA>
<PARA>Together with the superannuation guarantee and existing award superannuation this initiative will, within a generation, boost Australia's annual saving performance by 4 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA>The return to budget surplus will reduce Commonwealth government debt, which is already well below the average for OECD countries, by almost 30 per cent as a share of GDP over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight's budget also addresses immediate high priority needs with new measures for families, health care, the environment and justice. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">FISCAL TIGHTENING</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the return of the budget outcome to surplus in 1995-96, and to substantial surplus in 1996-97 and beyond, fulfils the Government's promise to significantly tighten fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA>The measures announced tonight provide a net fiscal tightening, excluding the effects of asset sales and early debt redemptions, of $3 billion in 1995-96 and $4 1/2 billion in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA>On the outlays side this tightening has been accomplished by a rigorous examination of all areas of government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>The decisions the Treasurer is announcing produce a net reduction in outlays of $700 million in 1995-96 excluding asset sales and early debt redemptions. Overall, a real reduction in outlays of 2.5 per cent has been achieved, the first real reduction since 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>Outlays are projected to fall from 26.7 per cent of GDP in 1994-95 to 24 per cent of GDP in 1998-99, demonstrating the Government's determination to reduce its call on national saving. </PARA>
<PARA>Total taxation revenue collected by the Government as a share of GDP declined in each of the 6 years between 1987-88 and 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA>The revenue measures that the Treasurer is announcing tonight strengthen the Commonwealth's tax base and provide a significant contribution to improving the budget outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>In all they add $2.4 billion to revenue in 1995-96 and $3.6 billion in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA>But even after allowing for these measures, budget balance will be restored with revenue much lower, in relation to GDP, than in the past. When we last moved into surplus in 1987-88 revenue represented 27.2 per cent of GDP compared to an estimated 25.3 per cent in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA>Our fiscal policy compares more than favourably with that of most other industrialised countries and, amongst such countries, we will continue to be one of the lowest taxed. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">SUPERANNUATION</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, one of the principal objectives of this Budget is to meet the medium term imperative of improving national saving to maintain investment and employment through the 1990s and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight the Treasurer is announcing, on behalf of the Government, a radical and innovative program to meet that challenge and further decrease Australia's reliance on foreign borrowings. This initiative complements the addition to Australia's savings arising from the budget surplus. It meets a goal and establishes a commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>The goal is better retirement incomes for Australians. The commitment, simultaneously established, is to substantially increase the nation's savings.</PARA>
<PARA>The measure will build on one of the most far-reaching steps taken during the Government's years of office&mdash;the development of Australia's superannuation and retirement incomes policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight's announcement will dramatically strengthen and extend that policy. It will not only sharply increase the incomes of Australians in retirement, but will also build a large pool of savings to finance the nation's continuing prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA>This initiative has two elements, an employee superannuation contribution and a matching government contribution. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, in One Nation we said, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>"The Government will be giving consideration to using employee contributions and tax cuts to increase the total level of superannuation support by a further 3 per cent of earnings."</PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that this is the time to do so&mdash;in fact, we believe there is now a need to go beyond the objectives we set then. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, under tonight's initiative, the Government will support the inclusion in all awards of provisions for employee superannuation contributions beginning at 1 per cent of earnings in July 1997 and rising to 3 per cent of earnings by July 1999. </PARA>
<PARA>This will be timed to coincide with wage increases through enterprise agreements or awards, so that workers will not experience a reduction in disposable income. </PARA>
<PARA>The second element, Mr President, is that the Government will match dollar for dollar the contributions paid by most employees into their superannuation accounts&mdash;a government contribution, when fully phased in, of $4 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA>By paying the One Nation tax cuts into employees' superannuation accounts we are delivering them in a way that significantly improves national saving. </PARA>
<PARA>Together, additional contributions will add 6 per cent of wages to the superannuation of people earning around average incomes. By 2002 this will build on the 9 per cent contribution from employers under the Superannuation Guarantee arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>This new initiative will, therefore, lift the superannuation savings for a person on around average earnings to a minimum of 15 per cent of their wages. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to make it abundantly clear, however, that the Government continues to see the age pension as the foundation stone of our retirement incomes policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight's arrangements build on the existing pension system. </PARA>
<PARA>For a couple on average earnings, now in their mid 30s, the Government's initiatives deliver retirement incomes 75 per cent higher than the age pension. </PARA>
<PARA>For their children joining the workforce in the next decade, retirement incomes will be more than double the age pension. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the new policy has been designed to benefit low and middle income earners. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, employees currently contributing to superannuation will not need to make additional contributions to be eligible for the matching government payment. </PARA>
<PARA>The government contribution will be means tested. The Government will match contributions up to a limit of around $1 000 per annum for all workers earning less than around $46 000. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will enable the self-employed to claim the matching government contribution on a proportion of their superannuation savings. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, for equity reasons, the existing means-tested rebate for member contributions will be retained. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the policy announced tonight will change forever the expectations of workers as they move towards retirement age. </PARA>
<PARA>It will give Australia a comprehensive long-term private savings plan&mdash;one that could not have been contemplated without the ground breaking work on superannuation done by this Labor Government since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable members that in 1983, after decades of neglect by the Liberal and National parties, less than 40 per cent of all employees had superannuation coverage. Today, as a result of our reforms, that total is nearly 90 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>For women, the increased coverage from the previous initiatives of this Government has been even more spectacular, rising from 24 per cent in 1983 to 85 per cent today. Thus women now have a major stake in superannuation&mdash;and it will be a bigger stake after the Budget's measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Today superannuation savings have already reached $186 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>But, Mr President, under the policy announced tonight that figure will increase tenfold by the year 2020. </PARA>
<PARA>Together with our earlier reforms, tonight's initiatives are estimated to further increase national saving progressively by around 2 per cent of GDP per year by the end of the decade. When fully implemented, they will add 4 per cent of GDP per year to national saving. In today's values that means an increase in saving in the order of $18 billion per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>These new superannuation measures will be extremely good for Australian workers and their families, and just as good for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">ECONOMIC AND EMPLOYMENT      GROWTH</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, Australia's economy has been growing for 3 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA>During this time, Australia has had one of the best performing economies among industrialised countries. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1994, Australia was among the fastest growing industrialised countries, but with inflation below the average of these countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Notwithstanding the severe drought which has affected much of eastern Australia, GDP growth is expected to be 4 3/4 per cent in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA>And this growth has been broadly based. </PARA>
<PARA>Business investment, which has been growing since late 1992, is expected to grow by 18 per cent this fiscal year. </PARA>
<PARA>Employment has grown by 4.2 per cent over the 12 months to March 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>By delivering around 550 000 new jobs since April 1993, the Government has already surpassed its election commitment to create half a million jobs in this term of office. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen to 8.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>The number of long term unemployed people has fallen by 25 per cent over the 12 months to March 1995 as the Government's Working Nation program continues to assist them into jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>Critical to maintaining this strong growth in activity and employment has been the maintenance of low inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's inflation rate has been below that of our major trading partners over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Low inflation is the result of reforms to the structure of our economy over the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA>A key factor has been the success of the Government's wages policy and industrial relations reforms through the Accord, which is unique to this Labor Government and rejected by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>Business is facing an increasingly competitive environment. </PARA>
<PARA>With protection reduced and markets opened to competition, businesses are increasingly required to adopt international standards of best practice. </PARA>
<PARA>Widespread microeconomic reforms have also resulted in a more competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA>The recent historic agreement between the Commonwealth and the States to implement the national competition policy reforms will, in conjunction with related reforms in industries such as energy and transport, further raise the level of competition in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>All these developments are keeping production costs and therefore inflationary pressures down. </PARA>
<PARA>An added benefit of this restraint in prices and wages is that it puts less pressure on monetary policy, and reduces the need for increases in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of these improvements in labour and product markets, Australia's international competitiveness is now 18 per cent higher than in the September quarter 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, rapid growth in domestic demand, particularly for investment goods, has led to a sharp rise in imports. In addition, adverse effects on our exports from drought and the hesitant recovery in Japan have increased our current account deficit to an estimated 6 per cent of GDP this year. </PARA>
<PARA>Tackling this problem is largely what this Budget is about. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">OUTLOOK FOR 1995-96</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, in 1995-96 GDP growth will ease from the higher rates recorded in 1994 but will remain strong, at around 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Domestic demand will move more into line with growth in output as a result of:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a slight moderation in private consumption;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a continued decline in dwelling investment as housing construction eases back toward underlying demand; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a slowing in public demand growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Export growth should be rapid as world demand continues to grow strongly and the effects of the drought begin to ease. Reduced domestic demand will lead to a decline in the growth of imports. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite an offsetting increase in our net income deficit due to higher world interest rates, the current account deficit is expected to decline by  1/2 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA>Wage growth is expected to be higher in 1995-96 but, in the context of enterprise bargaining and continued improvements in productivity, it should remain compatible with maintaining an underlying inflation rate around 2 to 3 per cent on average over the course of the economic cycle. </PARA>
<PARA>This favourable outlook is strongly supported by the union movement's commitment to responsible wage outcomes under the Accord. </PARA>
<PARA>And achievement of this goal will be further aided by the spread of enterprise bargaining throughout the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>Employers and employees are taking advantage of the new system by making work practices more flexible, thus improving our productivity performance and providing a firm basis for wage rises for Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA>A new Accord is being negotiated with the ACTU, which will underpin the continuation of responsible wage outcomes and low inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Business investment is expected to remain strong in 1995-96, rising by around 13 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>This will contribute to growth in the capital stock and help maintain economic growth without supply bottlenecks triggering higher inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Employment will continue to grow strongly, by about 3 per cent or over 240 000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>The unemployment rate should fall to around 8 per cent by mid-1996. </PARA>
<PARA>Real household disposable income is forecast to increase by 4 1/4 per cent, following this year's 4 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the economic environment facing us over the next few years is one that offers great national opportunities, and great opportunities for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget's savings strategy will allow us to maximise these opportunities for economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">FAMILIES</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I now turn to other significant measures in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget includes a major statement on our Agenda for Families which responds to the issues raised during the International Year of the Family. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will provide further practical support for families through the initiatives the Treasurer is announcing tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>A new means tested maternity allowance of $816 will be introduced from 1 February 1996. It will provide a vital boost to family income when it is most needed: on the birth of a baby. </PARA>
<PARA>About 85 per cent of women will be eligible for the payment which will be available to women both at home and in paid employment. </PARA>
<PARA>The level of Guardians Allowance paid to sole parent pensioners will be increased by $4 a fortnight from September 1996. Rent assistance will also be increased by $5 a fortnight from March 1996 for families with children. </PARA>
<PARA>Both these measures build on significant real improvements in family payments made to low income families over the life of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>From July 1995 the new Parenting Allowance which was announced as part of Working Nation will provide about 115 000 low income working families with an average gain of $59 a week. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, tonight's Budget also focuses on the health needs of families through preventative health care measures for children and young people. </PARA>
<PARA>To raise the immunisation rates among our children and so reduce the incidence of preventable diseases, a National Childhood Immunisation Program costing $11m in 1995-96 will be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>A new `Health Australia' program provides $18m over 3 years for measures to strengthen health promotion and reduce the consumption of tobacco, particularly among young people. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the Government will continue to help families meet the challenges faced by competing work and family responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will deliver on its 1993 promise to meet the projected demand for work related care by 2000-01. </PARA>
<PARA>In this Budget we have taken steps to ensure that the focus is on meeting the needs of working parents, while providing equitable access to subsidised child care for parents who stay at home with their children. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will also provide additional financial support to carers of older people and disabled people, and will promote the role of carers in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of the measures to be announced in the Government's forthcoming Justice Statement will help families to avoid legal problems and deal with disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>Families of indigenous Australians remain seriously disadvantaged. In this Budget, the Government will build on past initiatives by spending an additional $204m over 4 years to improve the standard of health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">OTHER OUTLAYS MEASURES</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, to reduce spending, the Government looked first at the cost of delivering its own programs. </PARA>
<PARA>Indexation arrangements for both Commonwealth Own Purpose Outlays and Specific Purpose Payments to the States with substantial wage costs are to be rationalised from 1 July 1995 producing savings of almost $2 billion over the next 4 years. </PARA>
<PARA>The changes will not apply to personal benefit payments&mdash;that is, there will be no change to indexation arrangements for pensions, allowances and other income support payments. </PARA>
<PARA>Reductions in administrative costs of departments and agencies will produce savings of around $640m over the next 4 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Together with a range of efficiency and other measures already adopted by the Government over recent years, this will lead to a reduction in administrative costs of 15 per cent in real terms over the next 4 years. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has also been able to reduce spending on labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA>These savings will not jeopardise achievement of the Government's Working Nation targets. They result largely from more efficient delivery of programs and a stronger labour market. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget also includes measures to simplify the income test applying to pensions through the introduction of a deeming system on financial investments only. It will replace the current system of assessment of unrealised capital growth on shares and managed investments. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will take steps to reduce the rapid escalation of some health program costs. </PARA>
<PARA>New arrangements for delivering pathology services and an increase in the safety net threshold for general patients under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from $407 to $600 from 1 January 1996 will provide substantial savings.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government reaffirms its election commitment to support health research by increasing funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council by $58m over 4 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, for the higher education sector there is a budget-neutral package which will provide 5850 new higher education places over the next 3 years and increased funding for research infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>An additional $217m over 4 years will be provided for initiatives to protect our natural environment, with particular emphasis on our coastline and our native forests. </PARA>
<PARA>We will accelerate implementation of the National Forest Policy Statement through a $53m package over 4 years to undertake comprehensive regional forest assessments in five high priority areas and conclude associated regional forest agreements with the States. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government also remains determined to improve the urban environment with a further $254m over 4 years for the Better Cities Program. </PARA>
<PARA>In a major addition to our transport infrastructure, international and domestic airport facilities will be constructed at Sydney West in time for the Sydney 2000 Olympics. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight the Treasurer is announcing further developments in the Government's asset sales program. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government proposes to sell and lease-back DASFLEET's motor vehicle fleet this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's remaining 50.4 per cent equity in the Commonwealth Bank will be sold in two tranches, one in 1995-96 and one in 1997-98. </PARA>
<PARA>The sale will complete the process of putting the ownership of the Bank on a fully commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">REVENUE</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the revenue side of the Budget will also play its part in fiscal tightening. </PARA>
<PARA>With the strong economic recovery, the corporate profit share has returned to the record levels of the mid 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>Companies in Australia have also benefited from a number of tax concessions in recent years to stimulate business activity. They include investment allowances, accelerated depreciation, the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession and a large reduction in the company tax rate from 39 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>These measures will be providing a benefit of more than $3 billion to businesses in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA>Now that the economy is growing strongly it is appropriate that the corporate sector make a contribution to the tightening of fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the rate of company income tax will be increased from 33 to 36 per cent for the 1995-96 and subsequent income years. </PARA>
<PARA>This measure will add $320m to revenue in 1995-96 and $1 570m in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA>The One Nation statement reduced the wholesale sales tax on passenger motor vehicles by 5 per cent to stimulate demand. </PARA>
<PARA>Now that passenger motor vehicle sales are at a high level, it is appropriate to restore the sales tax rate to the general rate of 21 per cent from tonight.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has also decided that, from 1 July 1995, sales tax at the concessional 12 per cent rate will apply to currently exempt builders' hardware and certain building materials used mainly in the completion of buildings. </PARA>
<PARA>The bulk of building materials used in construction, such as bricks, timber, cement and roofing tiles, will remain exempt. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, Medicare levy receipts as a proportion of Medicare outlays have fallen from over 30 per cent in 1988-89 to an expected 24 per cent in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA>Tonight the Treasurer is announcing an increase in the Medicare levy from 1.4 to 1.5 per cent which will partially reverse this decline. </PARA>
<PARA>The excise rate on tobacco will rise by 10 per cent from tonight. This will replace the 5 per cent increase originally scheduled for August 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>In recent years evidence has emerged of an erosion of the PAYE tax base, where individuals have attempted to move out of traditional employer/employee relationships in order to avoid tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the Government will be amending the income tax law to ensure the intended coverage of the PAYE provisions can be enforced. The Treasurer will also be releasing soon a discussion paper dealing with the use of other schemes to avoid tax on personal services income. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to reduce deferral of tax payments under the PAYE system, the threshold at which bi-monthly remittance is required will be reduced to $1m per year. Generally, this measure will affect companies with around 120 employees or more. </PARA>
<PARA>To protect the revenue base, the Treasurer is also announcing tonight measures to correct a number of deficiencies in the tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA>Eligibility for the research and development tax concession for syndicates investing in private tax exempt bodies will be limited to exclude investors who are not fully at risk. </PARA>
<PARA>This measure will prevent inappropriate access to tax benefits, and parallels a 1992 measure applying to public sector tax exempt research bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>There will be clarification of certain wholesale sales tax rate classifications including removal of the tax exemption for non-permanent microchips used in certain goods. The current exemption has proved virtually impossible to administer, introduced significant distortions and inefficiencies in the market, and caused considerable loss of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>'Light' fuel oils, which are in effect industrial diesel fuels, will be made subject to excise in the same way as diesel fuels. This is designed to address the tax-driven substitution of `light' fuel oil for diesel which is taking place at some cost to economic efficiency and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>From 1 July 1995, the interest rate which the Reserve Bank of Australia pays banks on their non-callable deposits will be set at 5 percentage points below market rates. This measure recognises the benefits which accrue to banks from being authorised by the Government and subject to RBA prudential supervision. </PARA>
<PARA>More detail on each of these and other revenue measures is contained in the budget papers and accompanying statements. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">CONCLUDING COMMENTS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, tonight's Budget responds to the economic challenges facing Australia today and in the years ahead in a creative and decisive way. </PARA>
<PARA>It presents a comprehensive plan to address the deficiency in our national saving. </PARA>
<PARA>The immediate restoration of the budget to surplus and the major enhancement to Australia's superannuation arrangements will dramatically boost our savings performance. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, we have improved the level of social justice so that all Australians benefit from our economic progress. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the past dozen years, Australia has undergone a transformation which has made our economy far more competitive, efficient and dynamic than was ever previously imagined. </PARA>
<PARA>We are now well placed to capitalise on these improvements. </PARA>
<PARA>With continued diligence, hard work, preparedness to change, and intelligent application of our collective skills, we can confidently look forward to a secure and prosperous future for this nation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) A comprehensive Review of ADF Housing Policies, completed in June 1993, re-examined 1986 and 1989 Cabinet Decisions concerning the level and form of housing subsidy and choice of housing for ADF members. Following this review, consultant Ernst and Young (Canberra) was contracted to examine the feasibility of a cash subsidy as an alternative to the current methods of delivering housing rental assistance and home ownership assistance to ADF members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The consultancy commenced in July 1994 and was completed in February 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) A final report from Ernst and Young (Canberra) was delivered to the Department of Defence in early February 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The consultant's final report will require detailed study within the Department of Defence and discussion with other agencies before formulation of a formal response which is anticipated in mid-1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) (i) The consultancy is complex and involves detailed market research and analysis which is beyond Departmental resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) The consultancy examined accommodation rental assistance and home ownership assistance which the Government provides to all ADF members. A range of cash subsidy options was considered; from the simple cashing out of current rental subsidies, which would permit all ADF members to exercise choice in the selection of their accommodation, to an option which would allow members to use a cash subsidy either to rent or to buy a dwelling. The consultancy involved much broader issues than the capitalising of existing rental subsidies for use as a deposit on an owner-occupied home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii) See answer to (1) (c) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) (a) occasional care centres are funded through the Family Support Funding Program each year. The Family Support Funding Program aims to enhance the lives of Defence families and improve the sense of community by providing grants for community projects developed by Defence families, encouraging Defence families and groups to determine needs in a local area, and increasing opportunities for Defence families to undertake self-help projects. Funding is based on submissions from the families themselves and may include centres, baby-sitting groups and playgroups depending on how families perceive their needs. The essential criteria of the program is that projects developed under the scheme must benefit a significant number of Defence families. The Government considers that the element of choice in the Family Support Funding Program is central to the success of the program, and the breakdown of activities on which monies are spent reflects the needs and priorities of local Defence families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1989-90, grants have been made to over 1,000 family groups, including child care grants totalling $468,722, grants for playgroups totalling $239,270, grants for playgrounds and recreational facilities totalling approximately $650,000 and grants for neighbourhood houses and community centres amounting to approximately $800,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been found that playgroups are required as much as occasional care as they are a good way of getting mothers and children together. Defence child care centres funded under the Defence employer-sponsored child care program for work-related child care also provide places for emergency respite care and some occasional care places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Occasional care was not specifically investigated as part of the Family Support Review. The Review examined structures within HQADF and the single Services for the delivery of family support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The Family Support Review has been completed and the implementation phase commenced on 13 February 1995. The need for Defence occasional care is being continuously addressed through the Family Support Funding Program. This program is based on submissions put forward by the families through the single Services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government does not consider that current sales tax treatment of certain water holding tanks and valves is anomalous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) As noted above, the Government does not consider the taxation of certain water holding tanks and valves to be anomalous. Indeed, to exempt water holding tanks from sales tax solely on the basis of whether they are attached to solar heating mechanisms would create anomalies. For example, no similar exemption would apply to other appliances that are powered by solar power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response to Senate question 1909 sets out further reasons why the Government does not propose to extend sales tax exemptions to water holding tanks attached to solar panels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Government already provides sales tax exemptions on a range of solar energy equipment. Other products incorporating renewable energy technology&mdash;such as wind power and wave power&mdash;would often be exempt from sales tax under the business input exemption provisions of the sales tax legislation. Furthermore, research and development relating to renewable energy technology benefits from the generous tax concessions for research and development.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales tax legislation does not provide exemptions for water holding tanks or valves, regardless of the power source for heating water contained in the tank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) There are several important arguments against exempting certain water holding tanks and valves from sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is desirable that environmental objectives be pursued through measures which meet well defined environmental objectives in the most efficient way. Tanks designed for the storage of water, for whatever purpose, appear to have little or no environmental merit in themselves;  extending taxation concessions to the water holding tanks of solar hot water systems would therefore result in an inefficient targeting of environmental objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To exempt water holding tanks from sales tax solely on the basis of whether they are attached to solar heating mechanisms would create anomalies. For example, no similar exemption would apply to other appliances that are powered by solar power. Another anomaly could arise if those who purchase solar heating panels and attach them to their existing hot water tank were to pay a higher amount of sales tax relative to those who purchase the solar hot water system inclusive of the water tank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost to the budget in the context of the Government's outlays, and tax expenditures, priorities is also a relevant consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No. Incentives need to be examined in the light of their cost and effectiveness in meeting their objectives. Some incentives will be better targeted and more efficient than others, while poorly targeted incentives should not be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) To the extent that there was a reduction in the price of solar hot water vis-a-vis water heated by other means, there could be some increase in demand for solar hot water systems. However, as the impact upon the price of the entire system would be relatively small, it is likely that the impact on demand would also be relatively small.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) An interim decision to give notice of the closure of the Omega station on 28 February 1994, announced in the statement issued jointly by the Minister for Transport and Communications and myself on 7 September 1993, was subsequently withdrawn after consultation with affected parties revealed considerable demand for the station's services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following sets out the background to these decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Omega station in Gippsland is run by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Upon its establishment in 1982 the costs of the station's operation were met by the commercial shipping industry. This was in accordance with the anticipated use by commercial shipping in the Australian region of the Omega system for navigation. By 1993, however, it was clear that the Omega system served no useful purpose for marine navigation in the Australian region. The industry was thus no longer willing to continue funding the station's operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of alternative funding arrangements an interim decision was made by the Government that the station would close. In accordance with the original bilateral agreement between Australia and the United States under which the station operated within the world-wide Omega system, the Australian Government gave the US Government 180 days notice of the intended closure. This was reflected in the joint statement made on 7 September 1993 by Senator Collins, as Minister for Transport and Communications, and myself. That statement did, however, also make clear that the Department of Transport and Communications and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would, prior to the Government's final decision on the station's future, seek submissions from affected users to assist the Government in making that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of this consultative process, there arose a number of appeals for the station's continued operation, including from other countries and from the World Meteorological Organisation. It became clear that the Omega system was still used for sea and air navigation in a number of other countries, as well as for the gathering of essential meteorological information by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, and by other meteorological bodies throughout the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in the South Pacific, and in southern Africa. As a result, the Government decided to itself provide funding for the continued operation of the station, until 30 September 1997; that funding being provided through the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. A media release on this matter was issued by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority on 1 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) This final decision was therefore a reflection of the Government's stated intention, referred to in the joint statement of Senator Collins and myself on 7 September 1993, to take into account the views of affected users. Mr Molloy's statement regarding the station's closure was made prior to the Government's final decision, and reflected the initial interim decision for the station to close upon the expiry of the 180 day period of notice given to the United States Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(a) As set out in the reply to (1)(a) above, the signals from the Australian Omega station's transmitter are used for navigation in a number of countries (although such usage will continue to decline in favour of more accurate systems, particularly satellite navigation), and for the gathering of essential meteorological information (through the tracking of weather balloons) by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, and by other meteorological bodies throughout the Asia-Pacific region and in southern Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The continued operation of the Australian Omega station until 30 September 1997 and its role within the world-wide Omega system is to be confirmed in an exchange of notes, which will constitute an agreement between Australia and the US. The draft notes, which are currently before Executive Council specify that, "The Omega signals from the Facility shall be used only for navigation, for search and rescue operations, for time dissemination, for climate monitoring and other meteorological purposes and for other purposes as mutually determined by the Parties, but shall not be used for communications other than those necessary to ensure the integrated operations of the Facility as part of the world-wide Omega System."  The draft notes further specify that, "In order to provide for certainty, especially for users and for employees of the Facility, both Parties shall endeavour to reach a mutual understanding at the earliest possible date as to whether, and under what conditions, the Facility will be operated beyond 30 September 1997."</PARA>

In the case of the deployment of the first ADF contingent to Rwanda in August last year, the UN arranged for the uplift of an advance party comprising 73 personnel, plus additional equipment and stores, using one US Air Force (USAF) C5 Galaxy aircraft. The main body, comprising 220 personnel, equipment and stores was uplifted by nine USAF C5 Galaxy and one C141 Starlifter aircraft and three commercially chartered B747 freighters. The UN Letter of Assist issued to the US to cover the cost of the ADF deployment to Rwanda was valued at US$8.6 million at no cost to Australia. A similar airlift by the RAAF would have involved in excess of 80 C130 aircraft flights. The RAAF simply did not possess the capacity to undertake such a significant task in the necessary timeframe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should the priority of movement so dictate and RAAF assets prove suitable for the task at an acceptable cost, the use of ADF resources is actively considered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Woodchips exported from native forests will be reduced by 20 per cent each year over the next five years except for areas where there has been significant progress towards, or the completion of, a regional forest agreement (RFA) that provides for the establishment of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system, as required under the National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS). This phase-out will not apply to plantations. This means that for 1996, the maximum permissable level for export will be 4.8 million tonnes, for 1997 it will be 3.6 million tonnes, 1998 2.4 million tonnes, 1999 1.2 million tonnes to nil in 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The consequence of this strategy is that from the year 2000, hardwood woodchip exports will only be approved for areas covered by, or where significant progress has been made towards, a regional forest agreement, and from plantations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's strategy is not inconsistent with the approach outlined by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in 1991. Mr Hawke stated that the Government's objective would be to phase out woodchip exports from native forests in favour of an increase in downstream processing by the year 2000. However, Mr Hawke also stated that woodchips exports would be considered on a case-by-case basis, after the year 2000, with full regard being paid to the objective that the fullest possible return be achieved from Australia's forest resources. The Prime Minister has simply placed Mr Hawke's statement into the context of the NFPS, which has been signed since the former Prime Minister's 1991 statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Three export woodchip licence holders have been given in-principle approval to export woodchips beyond the year 2000. In each of these cases the approval has been expressed to be subject to the issue of annual export licences. The intention of the Commonwealth in granting in-principle approval is to provide woodchip export companies with some degree of assurance and to justify commitments of capital. It is also intended to address the importance of security of supply for purchasers and requirements of charter arrangements for shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes that RFAs are the key to meeting conservation objectives and giving security to woodchip export licence holders. These agreements will identify areas available for logging and those requiring protection through a comprehensive, adequate and representative CAR reserve system. Once RFAs are in place, it is intended that companies will be issued with licences for periods substantially longer than the current one year period.</PARA>
