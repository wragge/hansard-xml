<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate. I ask: is it not true that France's decision to resume nuclear testing was foreshadowed by Jacques Chirac as early as 17 March this year in the lead-up to the presidential elections? Also, after his election, is it not true that there was much media speculation that he would make an announcement in the terms he subsequently did? But was it not the case that, in the meantime, your government failed to take any action to put Australia's point of view on this matter? In particular, why were not delegations and other diplomatic actions mounted of the type that are now being mounted subsequent to the announcement? What were you doing in the meantime, when there was a chance&mdash;when there was still an opportunity perhaps&mdash;to influence France away from this particular course of action?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, we do not release every letter that we write to other governments, Senator Alston. Maybe you will do that if you ever get into government, but governments rarely do. Mr President, it is my understanding that Senator Evans raised this question with the then foreign minister, subsequently now Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, while he was in France, and I know I also did so when I was in France for the VE celebrations. Any Australian minister that was in France at that particular period raised the question of nuclear testing and how seriously we in Australia regarded it. So the basis for Senator Hill's question, of course, is wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Isn't it not surprising, therefore, that if, on the one hand, the French government had what might be called form representations, a letter from the foreign minister, they knew that Australia was not serious on this matter when, at the same time, the Prime Minister of our country was writing to the French endorsing their bid to join the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because you are sending inconsistent messages. Obviously you are not serious about this issue. The question is this: in writing to the French inviting them to join Pacific regional organisations at a time when you knew they were going to make an announcement to resume tests, does that not demonstrate that your letter to the French President and the communications with the French foreign minister were simply a matter of form and that, in fact, no serious effort at all was made by the Australian government to dissuade the French from the action that they have now taken?</PARA></TALK.START>

The government made clear its position on these particular issues, as it has for a number of years&mdash;reluctantly and finally joined, I may say, by the opposition. You only have to go back to the parliamentary debates of 1985 and 1986 and look at what the opposition spokesmen, Mr Downer and Mr Peacock, said at the time to see how little support we have had over the years from the opposition. It accused us of running interference with the United States policy when we brought these issues up at the United Nations. When a nuclear-free South Pacific was up we got exactly no support from those opposite and now they lecture us on how we should handle our relations with France. We made it quite clear to the French government, as did other countries in this region, that we oppose the resumption of nuclear testing in this region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Last Friday the Minister launched the national wilderness inventory. Can he inform the Senate about the inventory's findings and can he tell us how this information will be used?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The national wilderness inventory is a database containing measures of wilderness quality across the entire Australian continent. This is the first time in the world that this sort of mapping has been done at such a level. There is both good news and bad news from the inventory. The good news is that, unlike most countries, Australia still retains large areas of wilderness, and it gives us options for conservation which are the envy of most other countries. The bad news is that the wilderness does not include all the ecosystems which were represented in Australia. Most of the wilderness areas that remain are either desert or very arid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inventory is a flexible decision-making tool that can assist scientists and administrators in monitoring wilderness loss, delineating wilderness areas, defining management options and predicting the effects of development on wilderness areas. It can also be used to assess the benefits of wilderness restoration proposals. For example, the inventory could stimulate the improvement in wilderness quality if a road or other structure were removed from a wilderness area. This improvement could then be assessed against the cost of such a proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inventory can be used to help identify boundaries for wilderness reserves and for developing management plans in those areas. While the national wilderness inventory does not in itself define these boundaries, it can provide invaluable information to state and territory governments when they make decisions. The inventory will also be used for evaluating forest areas for the 1996 woodchip licences. Data from the national wilderness inventory is also being used in the compilation of Australia's state of the environment report. Work is also currently being undertaken with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to adapt the national wilderness inventory methods for marine environments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national wilderness inventory model is also being utilised on an international scale. For example, an international consortium has completed a survey of the Barents Sea region in northern Scandinavia and north-west Russia using national wilderness inventory methods. This study is likely to be extended to the entire Artic region and possibly all of Europe. Interest has also been expressed by both US and Canadian agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to acknowledge that a lot of the data used in the national wilderness inventory has been provided by state and territory governments. Their involvement means that it is truly a national achievement, not just a Commonwealth inventory. This is particularly important because the land use decisions of the state governments are the ones which have the greatest impact on wilderness areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inventory is an exciting landmark development in Australia's environmental management. I think it will become an invaluable tool for decision makers in Australia. I congratulate all those who have been involved over a very long time in its development.</PARA>

In the light of the furious public reaction to Senator Evans's pussy-cat response to the French decision to resume nuclear testing, will the government now concede that the minister, in his desperate anxiety not to alienate Mr Keating's favourite country&mdash;and a member of the Security Council as well, I might add&mdash;completely misread the situation? As Senator Evans seems determined to whiz off overseas in a very belated and somewhat futile attempt to avoid question time, will the minister now take the opportunity to apologise to the people of Australia and the region for the classic Evans insensitivities such as, `The decision to resume testing was not as bad as it could have been'?</PARA></TALK.START>

Right through the 1970s and 1980s, we looked for a statement by Mr Howard on nuclear testing in the South Pacific&mdash;absolute silence. He led you for four years in opposition, from when you had your coup right through to the next coup. He is not on the public record once as condemning testing in the south-west Pacific.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have had this question asked. I thank Senator Jacinta Collins for asking it. One thing that the opposition certainly needs to know, which the child-care centres involved certainly do know, is that 94 per cent of the long day care centres across Australia are now registered to participate in that quality program in that quality system. That figure is a remarkable credit to the first National Child Care Accreditation Council, particularly in the light of the opposition's campaign against the accreditation process. I particularly wanted to acknowledge the contribution of that first council at its meeting today and to thank it very much for what it has been able to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to know that Australia is now getting international recognition for its accreditation program in child care. Only recently, Quentin Bryce, the chair of the National Child Care Accreditation Council, was invited to speak about Australia's unique system in Korea at the bi-national symposium on children. Korea is particularly interested in our national accreditation system, as were Canada and New York when I raised the matters and talked with them about it. Most other countries are very impressed, indeed envious, of what we have achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators also might know, an evaluation program is currently being undertaken by Coopers and Lybrand to evaluate the effectiveness of the accreditation program and its cost.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The final report will be any minute now, Senator, and then you will get your answer. But what the participation of parents and staff showed is that most centres agreed that, since the accreditation program has been instituted, quality of care that is provided in the centres has improved. To find that admission from the centres and staff and parents, I think, is a very splendid reflection on the accreditation council, the councillors and the chair, Quentin Bryce, in actually getting that system up and running, particularly in the face of the opposition that was mounted in this place by honourable senators on the other side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, there is still some considerable doubt about what the opposition wants to do with the accreditation process. I have no idea what its policy in this area is, except that it says it will withdraw from a requirement for accreditation and leave it at a voluntary system. Why would you want to do that when the system we have already established has been so effective? We have seen improved quality care; 94 per cent of centres registered; and the parents and staff very much participating in the process and admitting that it has improved the quality. They know that and they are prepared to say it. It has made a considerable difference. The parents have voted with their feet; the centres have voted. Accreditation certainly works.</PARA>

If the opposition is clear about quality in child care, it should come out and say so. It should come out and support our accreditation process, instead of having a kind of muted policy that, if it should ever get elected to government, it would withdraw the requirement to make it mandatory and would go back to a voluntary process and let the standards of quality slide.

I ask: what is the Australian government's response to recent media reports which suggest that the United States is now considering the resumption of underground nuclear testing? Secondly, in view of the huge environmental implications, the fact that China has never ceased nuclear testing and that France is now resuming it, does the government recognise the role of its uranium export policy&mdash;a policy, I might add, which is shared by the opposition&mdash;in the cause and effect relationship between the mining and export of uranium and the resumption of French nuclear testing in the Pacific? Finally, does this potential escalation on the part of the world's nuclear powers undermine the strength and validity of last month's agreement to indefinitely extend the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, particularly the commitment that right now nuclear weapons states should exercise the utmost restraint?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has said repeatedly and emphatically that we are absolutely opposed to nuclear testing by any state. Therefore, we are disturbed by reports that US Defense Secretary Perry has said that the US is considering the possibility of the resumption of nuclear testing. It would be inconsistent with the strong leadership President Clinton has given to the conclusion of the comprehensive test ban treaty, and we are seeking clarification of Secretary Perry's comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to assume at this stage that he has been accurately reported. There is debate about some issues that might have been misunderstood to have led to a suggestion from him that there might be a proposal for the US resumption of nuclear testing, so I am not yet accepting that it is true. But if it is true, we would oppose it emphatically&mdash;as we would do of anybody&mdash;but I am not assuming it is true. More likely than not, in my view, it is not. But if it is, we oppose the US doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, you are correct that China continues its testing and France is proposing to resume its testing. I cannot accept that in any way the export of Australian uranium is contributing to that. Our export is only to countries which are members of the non-proliferation treaty and with which we have a bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement, which is designed to ensure that Australian uranium does not end up in nuclear weapons programs or for purposes of nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to your third question concerning the non-proliferation treaty, the non-proliferation treaty is the single most important arms control and disarmament treaty we have. It is the only internationally legally binding instrument which commits nuclear weapons states to the goal of disarmament. That is why the French decision to resume testing is a breach of faith, including the point concerning utmost restraint to which you referred in your question, Senator Kernot. It is a breach of faith with all of those countries which supported indefinite extension of the NPT without a vote in New York last month. What is more, it could have an adverse effect on the climate of the comprehensive test ban treaty negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made this point very strongly to France. We will be working to ensure that the CTBT negotiations do conclude as scheduled in 1996 and that France does live up to its undertaking, repeated by President Chirac, that it would sign that comprehensive test ban treaty and, therefore, at that stage, cease nuclear testing forever.</PARA>

It is important that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty continues because, imperfect as it is, it is the only operative constraint, particularly on the proliferation of nuclear weapons. That is one of the reasons why, to the extent that the French initiative undermines the treaty and undermines French commitment to utmost restraint, this decision is so deplorable.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Childs for his question. He is right; this issue has been of interest to the business community for quite some time, particularly because that community is concerned to maximise business and economic opportunities in today's global economic environment. With Australian businesses interacting more than ever before with the region and the rest of the world, it is imperative that immigration processes facilitate that interaction and not impede it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have a reform agenda in this area. As some senators would be aware, the government has already implemented a number of significant reforms in the area of permanent business migration. Those changes are now in place. But temporary migration is also of critical importance. In the area of temporary entry, as Senator Childs has already pointed out, there is a raft of reforms, some already implemented, some planned for the future&mdash;reforms all together intended to make it much easier for business to do business overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in the budget it was announced that the government would introduce a single visa class for business people, and that business visitors would have the option of applying for visas in a free one-month category, a three-month multiple entry category, valid for five years or the duration of their passport, or a more than three months category. The latest initiative, which will come into effect on a trial basis next month, is designed to streamline the process even further, particularly for international business visitors nominated by selected corporations and state governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initially operating as a pilot program, this option will be available to the Queensland and Northern Territory governments and five or six large corporations. In essence, it will work on the basis that the people nominated will not need to complete an application form themselves, nor will they need to provide their passports to our overseas posts. In turn, nominators will provide the business people's passport details and other relevant data to my department's Brisbane office. Once a decision has been made, the evidence will be returned to the nominator. A visa granted under this particular provision will be for a three-month stay and will be valid for four years for a $35 fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be a pilot program but we intend to extend it in two ways by the end of the year. From November this year the option will be extended to nominated business visitors in the new budget initiative of a three-month multiple entry category. Secondly, at that time we intend to expand this initiative to cover all state and territory governments and it is also expected to involve a larger number of corporations. We have been liaising with the Business Council of Australia on the latter point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a firm agenda in this area to ensure that migration processes open up Australian business initiatives, not close them. As part of the initiatives in this area, I have asked Mr Neville Roach, the managing director of Fujitsu, to conduct a wide ranging review of temporary entry for business people. Once we receive his review&mdash;hopefully that will be in the not too distant future&mdash;we will be in a better position to make even greater changes to this particular area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main reason for amending the act is to ensure that the legislation gives full and thorough effect to our obligations under the Basel convention. As part of that we are, wherever possible, adopting the phrasing that is used in the convention itself. For this reason, we are dropping the phrase `dispose of safely' from the act and replacing it with the words `environmentally sound management' which is the phrase that is used in the convention. Given that the scope of the act will be very significantly extended to pick up a wide range of hazardous waste which it currently excludes, it is not clear how this could be interpreted in any way as a weakening at all. In fact the definition of `environmentally sound management', like any such phrase, including the phrase `dispose of safely', could be interpreted with differing degrees of stringency.</PARA></TALK.START>

Cuts in the order of $6 billion to $9 billion for agricultural support over the next five years are probable and indeed they will be very welcome by Australia should they occur.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to engage in the sort of knock-on type speculations which Senator Gibson engaged in in his question by proposing, `Oh my God, given our employment record, there might be higher unemployment in the future.' That is certainly not the government's view. For all the components, the budget forecasts that we have made are broadly consistent with the private sector forecasts. The general picture of GDP growth presented in the budget is slightly higher than that conveyed by the private sector forecasts, mainly reflecting the higher public final demand and business investment forecasts in the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget forecasts and private sector forecasts describe a similar outlook, despite some compositional differences, with the expectation of continued strong GDP growth&mdash;although not as strong as in the 1994-95 year&mdash;underpinned by continued strong business investment, modest inflation, strong employment growth, and a current account deficit at about the same level as in in monetary terms; in percentage terms we expect it to decline by half a per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private consumption, dwelling investments, stocks and net export forecasts in the budget are consistent with what the private sector forecasters are saying. The budget forecasts for employment growth and the unemployment rate in the June quarter 1996 are consistent with the private sector average. The budget headline CPI forecast is again consistent with the private sector average forecast. The budget forecasts for business investment and the current account deficit are higher than the private sector forecasts. The budget forecast for final demand is higher than some private sector forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly, we see no reason why the budget forecasts ought to be varied. Forecasting is, of course, a business in which one tries to read the economic tea-leaves and predict the future. When we came down last year with a forecast in the budget for business investment in Australia, the figures that came out were, in the end, that the Treasury was wrong. It had underestimated in the budget the level of growth. But at the time that we made that forecast, everyone else in the forecasting field virtually said we were wrong because we had overestimated by a huge percentage. Nonetheless, the record here is quite a strong one and there is nothing happening out there that we believe ought to encourage us in the slightest to amend our forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of employment, we still look forward to reaching what we believe is a figure within our grasp by the year 2000 of a level of unemployment in Australia of about five per cent. That would still be too high for what we think is ideal but it would be a magnificent achievement in terms of growth. In order to achieve that it requires us to have strong, sustainable levels of growth, which is what we have at the moment. The budget forecast of 3 3/4per cent for this financial year has the economy growing in a strong way but, importantly, sustainable over the long haul, so that we do not go into dips and peaks all the time; rather, so that we have a strong level of sustainable growth ever onward, creating the right platform for employment growth.</PARA>

One of the most effective measures for identifying and removing discrimination against older people is to give older people a voice. The Minister for Human Services and Health has done this by establishing the older Australians advisory councils. The national, state and territory councils provide advice and information to the minister on the care and well-being of older Australians. One measure which could be regarded as discriminating in favour of older people is the application of community rating principles to the operation of private health insurance.

The amendment and guidelines provided access to the scheme for approved joint ventures and consortia and approved trading houses.

However, in order to put the issue beyond question, I will be seeking appropriate amendments to the EMDG act. Austrade has advised me that since it took over operational carriage of the EMDG legislative process, measures have been put in place to ensure that such an oversight does not occur.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today I asked Senator Cook, who is a very senior cabinet minister and who represents the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in this place, a very simple, yet very serious, question. I asked him a question in relation to a very important statement by the Treasurer last week that the Reserve Bank now has more genuine autonomy than in the early 1980s so far as its administration and conduct of monetary policy is concerned. Monetary policy is one of the three fundamental planks of economic management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the Treasurer had been trying to denigrate the very legitimate statement by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, following the admission by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, speaking in London last week, that interest rates could well go up in the future just as they could go down or remain unchanged. The important thing was that he was not ruling out further interest rate increases in the near future. He was not ruling them out because he expressed concern about the inflationary pressures that are arising in the economy as a result of the pressure of wage increases and also the inflationary consequence of the falling value of the Australian dollar in the international currency markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those concerns have also been expressed and shared in the latest National Australia Bank confidence index, which shows that there has been a significant fall in that index of confidence from a peak of 30 per cent in September 1994 to just 8 per cent in June this year, with the main reason for that dramatic fall in confidence being given as the fear of further interest rate rises. I asked the Minister representing the Treasurer what changes in the administration of monetary policy could have led the Treasurer to the conclusion he came to in his statement last week that the Reserve Bank has infinitely greater autonomy in terms of monetary management than it had a decade or more ago and, therefore, any political manipulation of interest rates for such obscene things as electoral timing purposes could not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have expected the Minister representing the Treasurer to be able to tell us in this chamber what the Treasurer had been referring to last week, but he did not have a clue. More significantly&mdash;and a matter of very great concern&mdash;he had no answer to the question about the inconsistency between Treasurer Willis's remarks last week and the remarks of one of the Treasurer's predecessors as Treasurer, the Prime Minister. Paul Keating took part in some famous Placido Domingo type interviews back in 1989. One was on the record during an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What brought this home to me was evidence by the beekeepers association that the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport received at a hearing in Brisbane last week. In its submission to us, it made it clear in no uncertain terms that it holds AQIS responsible for the introduction of chalkbrood, which is a very dangerous disease that was introduced into Australia, through Queensland, in January 1993. That is when the first-known presence of it was discovered. It has now spread to New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The association pointed out that the beekeeping industry has for many years been trying to get AQIS to take the threat of the incursion of chalkbrood into Australia as a serious matter. It was obviously put off&mdash;it states this further in its submission; I will mention it&mdash;by the same sorts of arguments that have been made about the potential danger of viruses in pilchards to the fish industry in Australia and what it calls the minimal or acceptable risk of these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry asked AQIS to ban the importation of pollen into Australia because it believes that that is the way this disease was introduced. But AQIS would not ban the importation of pollen into Australia from countries which had chalkbrood. It was well known at that time that pollen was the vector for carrying these spores in the importation of honey. Obviously AQIS indicated that it may do that. However, it was later found that there was not a complete ban on the importation of pollen. As a result, it was generally recognised that the incursion of chalkbrood came from the importation of infected pollen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence, Mr Weatherhead said that a large shipment was found in South Australia but that it had entered through Brisbane. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The perceived attitude with the threat from pollen importation was, `You are only beekeepers. We are the scientists with the University degrees'.</PARA>

I have been infested with a noxious weed that has covered my place for 30 years. That was also as a result of incorrect procedures in importing seed. I have an interest in this.

Several papers over the weekend, starting with a Melbourne paper in an article by Fia Cumming, had me saying that a foreign virus had been identified on the gills of dead pilchards. I said that a virus had been identified on the gills of dead pilchards. I made that distinction very carefully. One of my concerns&mdash;it was amplified today in the reply of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins)&mdash;is that  insufficient research has gone on in Australia to establish the database of viruses and naturally occurring disease organisms in the Australian marine environment. Against that `dearth' of information&mdash;to use the minister's word&mdash;we are now really floundering in an attempt to find out what exactly has caused this massive fish kill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did check back with Fia Cumming, and she read over the original draft of her article to me. Senators may be interested to know that the word `foreign', as a qualifier for `virus', crept in somewhere at the subeditorial level. So even if while reporting you a journalist writes something carefully and accurately, evidently subeditors will jazz up a story sometimes and add in other words which change the whole sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister referred to a survey which has been going on, he said, since 1992 and which will shortly be completed. However, it indicates&mdash;and I think the point needs to be stressed again and again&mdash;that this government is spending far too little on research in understanding the Australian environment comprehensively and completely so that there is the database in place and so that we do know whether a foreign pollen, a foreign wheat, a foreign pilchard or a foreign Atlantic salmon is carrying an agent which is not present in the Australian environment and which potentially could cause a disease and also know something about the immunity of natural populations in Australia so that again we can get a better handle on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that, although this inquiry into the pilchards has been going on for weeks and in fact for months, it may simply be that dearth of background information&mdash;and I use the minister's word `dearth' again&mdash;due to the failure of this government and of successive governments to spend enough on environmental research which will preclude a definitive answer to the question. It should be relatively simple with that background information to identify exactly what was causing this fish kill. The inability to identify the cause, in my view, relates to the fact that scientists, unfortunately, are working against a background of insufficient knowledge; and that insufficient knowledge relates very much to the government's lack of spending on research. </PARA>

But the basic fundamental data, the background on which you do this sort of research, must be public interest research. It must be carried out in universities and CSIRO. It must be publicly funded.

<PARA>In his answer to me today, Senator Cook took the liberty of saying what he thought was the Democrats' rationale for deciding at this stage to oppose the building hardware tax. I wanted to put on the record, obviously, the factors that we took into consideration. We did not jump up on budget night and say, as others do in this place, `We are opposed to everything on principle.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to go through the chronology of this kind of tax to point out that it was in 1981 that John Howard tried to impose a 2 1/2 per cent tax on building supplies, and that it was in 1981 that Mr Ralph Willis, the current Treasurer, said that this was a regressive tax and that it would impact unfairly and affect the equity of the tax system. These sales tax bills were used as a double dissolution trigger in 1983, and the Liberal government was defeated. In 1988, Treasurer Paul Keating then said, `Oh, we have to extend the sales tax net to bathroom fittings just to address a couple of anomalies.' He said that some household fittings were already taxed. That time, the opposition voted with the government for that extension to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995, we see current Treasurer Ralph Willis extending the sales tax to all building hardware other than basic materials like concrete and timber, again using the argument that the current tax situation is anomalous. The tax is also extended to things like nails and paint and tiles, and creates a whole range of new anomalies. One that comes to mind is the fact that kitchen cupboards which are prefabricated and which are built off site are subject to the tax. But if you ask the builder to build your kitchen on site&mdash;and builders will say that this is often a less efficient use of resources&mdash;then that kitchen is exempt from this 12 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new tax arrangement creates as many new anomalies as it addresses. A future government could say, `We are going to close these new anomalies by extending the sales tax regime even further.' For those who have been involved in this debate since 1981, there is a question of consistency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw attention to other measures the government has taken, specifically the cuts to public housing funding. In 1995, the budget cut housing funds by $44 million in real terms. That followed a $68 million cut in 1994. In the 1995 budget, the government similarly cut $6 million from rental assistance. According to ACOSS, that change has left 325,000 households worse off. These things are worth considering when you are considering what to do about this particular tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to what dropping this measure would do to the budget, Mr Willis has responded with the blackmail tactic of saying, `The Senate will be held accountable for interest rate rises.' He should have thought about that in 1981 when he said, `It is right and appropriate to block these bills because they are not in the best interests of this country.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say to Mr Willis that we believe&mdash;we have independent corroboration of this&mdash;that this move will have a negligible impact on interest rates and the financial markets. It will not affect Treasury's bond issue program of about $3 billion to $4 billion in 1995-96. As a matter of fact, if we look at what has happened in the market since the announcement on Thursday night, we see that the dollar rose by 0.6 cents, the all ordinaries index was up 13.3 points, the bond market was steady, and 90-day bank bills closed just 0.01 per cent higher. In other words, the announcement had no impact at all on the financial market. The financial markets are probably more interested in the government's tactics in floating Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and the flooding of the market with asset sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the budget this government seems to have had no difficulty finding money for chequebook campaigning. We have seen $130 million for the extension of a freeway in the Adelaide hills, $160 million for the access to justice package, promises of a referendum costing maybe $100 million, a civics education program&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate about the building products tax is absolutely remarkable. Senator Kernot's announcement last week that the Australian Democrats had somehow seen the light and were going to oppose the introduction of this tax was nothing short of miraculous because the Democrats have sought to impose more taxes on the people of this country than any other party since creation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Gosh, that wailing is deafening. The tax is a real problem for the hardware industry. The proprietors of hardware stores have expressed extreme concern. Up until last week, when the Australian Democrats suddenly opened their eyes and realised that a budget had been delivered a month or so earlier, the hardware stores had been lobbying for the Democrats and the Greens to see the light. Those in the industry said that they seemed to hit a brick wall because the Democrats and the Greens could not understand the impact that this measure was going to have on the hardware stores and the building industry. Small contractors have to put money up front and simply could not afford it at a time when there is a downturn in the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suddenly, the Democrats are saying that this impost is going to have an effect on the industry. All I can say is that we are very pleased that the Democrats have now seen the light and are going to join us in the position that we have adopted from the night when the budget was delivered. If this group of individuals down here was seriously going to look at the problem they would oppose a whole range of other taxes that will impact right across the board. But they choose not to. They have picked one single, solitary tax. We welcome that. But why do they not look at the broader impact of the tax imposts in this budget?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats simply will not look at the reality of the situation. They have not looked at all the different people who are affected; they have simply isolated some of those people. Obviously, it was not until ACOSS came and tapped on the door and said, `Wake up!' that the Democrats said, `Oh, there is a problem'. We are now nearly five weeks down the track, but at least the decision has been made and it is welcomed. I hope that the Democrats will now take a look at the budget and realise that there are other imposts in it that may well need to be rejected. They must take it upon themselves to read the entire budget for the first time. They obviously read some of it last week when they came to their decision on this one narrow, little tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, am intrigued by the position that the Labor Party has taken on this matter. The Labor Party says that it is a disgrace for us to oppose sales tax rises. However, in 1981 it was perfect and kosher and lovable for the Labor Party to oppose sales tax rises because it was in opposition and we were in government. The double standards are incredible!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike my colleague Senator Knowles, I wholeheartedly welcome Senator Kernot's conversion on the road to Damascus. I am overjoyed to see it. It was evident from the very night of the presentation of the budget that the opposition was maintaining the position which Senator Kernot is now supporting. I commend her. I might direct her attention to the general question of sales tax rises&mdash;a matter which I have been raising for some time. Here we have Labor's hidden GST which hits the poor hardest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently we have the highest level of consumption tax as a percentage of GDP in Australia's history. We have had something like a one-third increase in the level of sales tax collections since the last election. That is a larger rise in consumption taxes than would have occurred under the GST. This comes from Labor's secret, sneaky sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Democrats, having found morality in the question of sales tax on some particular building materials, might discover morality in a more general and philosophically pure basis and recognise what this government has done to consumers&mdash;particularly the poor consumers of Australia. Without any of the offsetting benefits which would have emerged under the GST&mdash;which this government attacked&mdash;the government, by deception and deceit, has hit the lowest income earners in Australia the hardest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Continual studies have demonstrated that the burden of the wholesale sales tax clearly falls most heavily on low income earners. There has been study after study to demonstrate it. On top of that, a recent study showed that a poorer person will often consume greater quantities of biscuits and snack products per capita than a wealthy person. They are all subject to sales tax. It also said that wealthy persons consume crayfish, caviar, expensive cuts of meat and exotic fruits, all of which are currently exempt from sales tax. The Labor Party's sneaky, dishonest consumption tax&mdash;it is called a sales tax&mdash;deliberately hits hardest on the poor. Yet this was the party that went to the last election saying, `We must not have a consumption tax. We promise not to introduce a consumption tax.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that it was the Labor Party that introduced sales tax in the first place. It was Labor Prime Minister Mr Chifley, when he was Treasurer, who complained bitterly that having three different levels of sales tax was a disaster because it created confusion. It in fact involved lots of prosecutions of people accidentally charging the wrong sales tax fee. He said that it had to be reduced to two, which he did. How many are there now? There are five different categories now under this government. Poor old Ben Chifley would rotate in his grave if he looked at this mob opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this government&mdash;having objected strongly to the concept of consumption taxes and having sneakily and dishonestly fought against them at the last election&mdash;has now introduced its own GST by a device. It has increased the volume of consumption tax via the sales tax to the highest proportion ever in Australia's history. Yet we have this absolute nonsense from people such as Senator Cook saying that what they have done is honest, pure and lovely. He avoided answering the question that Senator Kernot properly put to him, `Why was it okay in 1981 for the Labor Party to do it and not okay for us to do it now?' The answer is very simple: because the Labor Party has double standards, because the Labor Party is deceitful, because the Labor Party tells lies at elections, as it did in this matter. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned that the Plans appear to have no commencement dates. Clause 2 of each of the Plans provides that the Plan is to commence "when notice of the fact that the plan has been determined is published under subsection 19(1) of the Act". Although this means of commencement is appropriate the NOTE at the end of the Northern Prawn Fishery Management Plan 1995 does not contain a commencement date. Also, there is no NOTE (and no date) at the end of the Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery Management Plan 1995. As the 1952 Act ceased to apply to the fisheries after 2 February 1995, the commencement dates are very significant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would be grateful if you could clarify the position with respect to the commencement dates of the Plans.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SBT Plan commenced on 3 February 1995 and the NPF Plan commenced on 10 February 1995. These are the respective dates on which notices of the determination of each plan were published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SBT Plan commenced the day after the Fisheries Act 1952 expired. This was the earliest day that the Plan could commence. Along with transitional provisions in the Plan itself, commencement on 3 February 1995 allowed the current fishing season in the SBT Fishery to continue uninterrupted. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commencement of the NPF Plan was delayed until the last of the Offshore Constitutional Settlement Agreements required to give the Commonwealth complete jurisdiction over the area of the NPF under the Fisheries Management Act 1991 could be formally executed by the Commonwealth. The delay in the commencement of the NPF Plan had no impact on the management of the NPF as, in accordance with established practice, the fishery was closed during the period December 1994 to April 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Fisheries Management Authority has advised that commencement dates will be inserted into all future plans of management, either by way of notes in the case of plans that are designed to commence on gazettal, or in the plan itself in the case of plans designed to commence on a previously ascertained date.</PARA>

There is no way that the current French government would be unaware of the feelings of Australia, New Zealand and the rest of the Pacific island countries on this particular issue. Those views were made clear to it right through the 1980s and into the 1990s and were revalidated by letters from the foreign minister, the Prime Minister and personal representations by the foreign minister to those likely to form this current Chirac government. Those views were obviously ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a great pity that the very good work that France has been able to achieve in the Pacific since the Matignon accords in 1988 have all been dealt a major and destructive blow by this one decision. It is true that its role in the Pacific has been much more up-beat in the last seven years. It has involved assisting other countries in the region, cooperating with countries in the region for the economic protection of Pacific islands and much better domestic relations in those territories that it currently occupies in the Pacific. All those things are put at risk by this particular decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actual motion goes to a variety of areas. It condemns the decision of the government of France to resume nuclear testing. It is most appropriate that the Senate should carry that particular one. It also calls on the French government to reverse that decision. The motion states that the Senate shares the resentment of other South Pacific countries to nuclear testing. It is here that Australia does have a pivotal role. Many of these countries do not have the resources or the standing in the world to make their voice known. It is up to Australia&mdash;supplemented and sometimes joined by New Zealand&mdash;to reinforce those views in all international forums where we can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly pleased to see that the European Parliament carried a resolution very similar to the one that has been put forward today. It is not just a matter of Australia, New Zealand and the other Pacific Islands raising protests on these issues. It is absolutely essential that other leading countries in the world make their views known and make them known strongly. It is essential that Australia protests the carrying out of such tests not only in the Pacific but also where they occur in China less we be regarded as hypocritical. There is a distinction between the two. China carries out nuclear testing in its own soil. That does not make it any better or any more justifiable, but in some ways the thought that France will be using territory 12,000 or 13,000 miles away is obnoxious to us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has often been made to France that if nuclear testing underground is so safe and causes no damage, why not do it in metropolitan France itself or Corsica or somewhere like that. The only response we get from the French government is that it has already spent the money on the infrastructure in the south-west Pacific. That is an extremely inadequate response by the French government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, some of the hysteria that has been whipped up on this issue is a bit Francophobic. Some of today's notices of motion reflect that they are concerned that Australia's reaction should be a sensible reaction. I join with Senator Knowles, Senator Kernot and others who have moved motions saying that our protest should be sensible and non-violent because the reaction in France to those sorts of events that occurred in Perth and elsewhere will not improve our chances of a reconsideration. The thought of people running around and putting signs up over French restaurants, mostly owned by people who have never been to France in their life, does smack of a bit of McCarthyism and we would not seek to encourage that form of activity. This in no way negates the ability of people to protest peacefully and assertively. No-one is trying to discourage that, but we are trying to encourage people to do it in a way that will at least reinforce the case with the French government and not have it react blindly and say it is some sort of Francophobic thing and nothing to do with the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gareth Evans and a delegation of South Pacific Forum nations will be visiting the French foreign minister at about 3.30 a.m. Australian time, which is about 7.30 p.m. French time, to make those views known. Senator Evans will then come back to Australia and report to the Australian government on what further action may have to be taken regarding this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to know what steps Australia could adopt to effect a reversal of the French policy or, indeed, to set up the circumstances that would inhibit any further decisions along these lines. We welcome the fact that, on indications so far, the French government&mdash;post these tests&mdash;will sign up for a comprehensive test ban. Some indication has been given that it may be on board for the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone. Those are the positive things that we will have to enforce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult when it comes to penalties. Some have been suggested in notices of motion today. This is a difficult area to disentangle, especially in the commercial area where contracts are already signed. The Australia government did decide to freeze the defence relationship between Australia and France at its current level&mdash;not a particularly high level as it turns out. There are areas that it is suggested be protected. I do not think it is desirable for the surveillance activities in the Pacific&mdash;basically fishing matters&mdash;to come into this, because the only people who will be punished are Pacific islanders. There is also a strong case for medivac and similar humanitarian or United Nations contact to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, Australia has very little defence contact with France, other than in those French companies sometimes set up as Australian companies that bid in the defence equipment area. That is an extremely difficult area to disentangle as there are existing contracts or tenders currently out. Apart from that, contacts are mostly occasional officer, ship or plane visit between the countries. We have made it quite clear that no ship or plane visit will be allowed if it has any connection with the testing of nuclear weapons in the south-west Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion may go through in its current form or it may be amended. It would be a pity if it were amended, especially if that merely reflects product differentiation or political partisanship. But everyone is entitled to hold views and senators may seek to change the motion. I think it would be a good thing&mdash;even though I do not think it likely&mdash;for this chamber and the House of Representatives to pass the same motion. As the numbers are different, that may not transpire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It will be a strange message to the French government if both houses of the parliament send a different message. Most people would agree that the time today to sort that out is very limited. Consultation is also limited&mdash;and I understand that. I will not comment at any length on the amendment proposed in another place other than to say that some of the matters will be considered when Senator Gareth Evans returns to Australia and reports to the government. Each of the points can then be given consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Australian government reiterates its condemnation of the French government for resuming nuclear tests in the south-west Pacific. This government has a track record of opposing such tests wherever they occur around the globe. In this instance, Australia feels a special imperative to represent those small Pacific island nations that find it hard to have their voice heard around the world, to articulate not only their concerns but ours, and to try to get the French government to reverse its decision. This will not be an easy task; the French government was well aware of the reaction many countries around the globe would have when it took this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that I hope the debate and the general discussion on this issue around Australia remain focused on the basic issues and do not get into the emotive, hysterical and sometimes Francophobic atmosphere that leads to events such as that in Perth over the weekend. I hope that does not occur because as a nation I think we can deal with these issues maturely and, hopefully, get a result. </PARA>

<PARA>In the same spirit that Senator Ray showed, my contribution is not designed in terms of product differentiation. I am trying to avoid being unduly politically partisan, to use his expression, because it is important on this occasion that a united voice be expressed by the people's representatives in this place. It is a pity in some ways that it does not seem to have been possible for the parties to have achieved a consensus motion in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the distinction between what the government is moving and what we are seeking to add is that we are calling for more positive action to be taken to demonstrate how appalled all Australians are at the decision that has been taken by the government of France. It was a totally unnecessary decision in this post-Cold War environment, a decision which is particularly regrettable in terms of its impact upon small Pacific island states, states with which we have a very close relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is so easy to simply call&mdash;as the government does&mdash;upon the French government to reverse its decision and say we share the resentment of South Pacific countries at this decision to resume nuclear testing, to express our outrage and to urge France to sign the CTBT without reservation in autumn 1996. There is no real pain in that as far as we Australians are concerned. In no way does it put any pressure on our relationship with France. Traditionally it has been close and important to us and, we would like to see, important to France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in terms of the motion of the government being put in such soft terms, its impact&mdash;regrettably&mdash;is likely to reflect the tenor of the government's sentiment. Regrettably also, it is likely to have little effect. That is why we think it is important, in terms of seeking to apply some real pressure&mdash;not in an effort to get product differentiation&mdash;that the government go further in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about such things as suspending part of our military cooperation, ceasing to refuel French non-humanitarian military transit flights, recalling our ambassador or involving the United States in the sharing of data, we are trying to put forward positive suggestions of action that this government could, and we believe should, be taking to apply some real pressure on France in this regard. Unless the Australian government is prepared to do that and take the risks associated with it, it is very difficult for the Australian people to take seriously the response that the government has made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will put this into context. We on this side of the chamber have to say how disappointed we are with the response of our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) when the decision of France was announced. Although, as Senator Robert Ray said in question time today, aspects of his statement expressed our outrage, nevertheless he sent a clear message to France that we do not really take the decision seriously when he said, `The decision to resume testing was not as bad as it could have been.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand what he means. France has announced a limited number of tests over a limited time. We presume that that is what he was referring to. But in diplomatic speak it was also clearly intended to send another message to France, which is that we are making a form protest but that we do not treat it all that seriously. That is what we were distressed about. That is why our spokesman and my leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), responded strongly to the disappointing statement made by Senator Evans. That is why we in question time today tried to get the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate to repudiate the statement of Senator Evans and say that, in effect, it did not reflect the position of the Australian government. But he refused to do so. He would rather talk through the issue than suffer any short-term political embarrassment that might flow from repudiating a statement which has clearly sent a message to France that the Australian government does not regard this matter all that seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that the government today was reluctant to take that action, because the earlier signals sent by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) also demonstrated that the Australian government did not see this matter as one of major consequence. I refer to the endorsement by the Australian government&mdash;post the decision of France to resume its testing in the South Pacific&mdash;of France's bid to join the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council in September. PECC is a regional organisation involving states of the Asia-Pacific. It seems to us that if the Australian government, through our Prime Minister, is at the time that we claim to be protesting so vigorously the resumption of these tests in effect inviting France to join us in regional bodies, again France can only get one message, which is that the Australian government is not really serious about its protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting that, when the endorsement of France's bid to join PECC was put to a spokesman for Mr Keating last week, the response of that spokesman was, `No consideration is being given to withdrawing the letter.' Even as of last week, the government was again sending a message to France that the decision of France has to be put into a wider context of regional cooperation. The Australian government was not placing great weight upon the decision to resume the tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern is that it is really all too late for the government to be responding in the parliament or publicly if it really is interested in doing its best to join with other states to dissuade France from this course of action. The time that the government should have been acting was before the decision of President Chirac was announced. Jacques Chirac, during the presidential campaign in France, made clear that this was one of the policies upon which he was standing for office. Upon his successful election, there was considerable and continuing press speculation that he was about to make the announcement to implement this policy decision. The best that the Australian government could do during that time&mdash;when there was a chance of influencing some different course of action&mdash;was for Senator Evans to write a letter to his counterpart in the French government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone knows that a letter of that type would have no real influence. If a delegation were to be sent, the time for that to happen was before the decision was announced whilst there was some chance of influencing France in a different direction. Discussions and dialogue could have commenced and effort could have been made to bring the United States and other major powers into a dialogue on the issue. But the Australian government simply did not show interest in the matter at that time. As I said, after the decision was announced, it did not show a great deal of interest, if we look at the words of Senator Evans. Only since the outrage of the Australian people has become evident to the Prime Minister has there been any real effort by the Australian government to be seen to be acting in this matter. Senator Evans and a low-level delegation have gone to France to make the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, if the Australian government were serious, would not Senator Evans be accompanied by senior ministers and heads of government of the states of the South Pacific? It has all the trappings of a low-level delegation. It sends a message to France that we are going through a form protest. We as a nation will express the point that we will really not take seriously our reaction to this decision by France to renew these tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response has been disappointing to date. As I said, we are prepared to support the motion in the terms that the government has brought to us. We add our amendments to add some substance. Again, the terms of the government's motion really do not demonstrate any real commitment to the cause that it is purporting to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to make those points on behalf of the coalition. We express our outrage and disappointment that a friend of Australia, France, should have acted in this way in this postwar environment at the time of the new world order. We believed that the days of nuclear testing and the development of further nuclear weaponry were behind the international community. I take this opportunity to say that, in the eyes of the opposition, this government should have done more. It should have done more prior to, and since, the announcement of the resumption. It should have brought to this parliament today a much stronger motion than it has. I have moved the amendment in the terms I put a little earlier. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a couple of other things. I think it is the French government&mdash;and this point has been made again and again, but it cannot be made enough&mdash;that is to be blamed, not the French people who live in Australia and who have been subject to not only adverse action in the sense of outright hostility but snide remarks and the sorts of innuendos that are sometimes put towards them. I think it is a great pity that we should take out on citizens or residents of this country something that has been decided by people overseas. So I put on record my support for all of those good French people in Australia&mdash;people who have a French background and are citizens of Australia and whose forebears may have been French. We realise, as a nation, that they are people who are very welcome here, who have made a great contribution to this country and who will do so in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one other matter that I want to deal with, and that is this. Senator Ray, when he introduced this motion, expressed the fond hope&mdash;and it is a fond hope&mdash;that we as a parliament might endorse this motion and then get to politicking later on. Senator Hill, with complete sincerity&mdash;and I accept him on this, and there is no doubt that this side of the chamber does&mdash;has joined in expressing the outrage of the opposition about this matter. The pity of his speech perhaps is this: when it is looked at, the amount of time he has spent condemning the French government will be far outweighed by the amount of time he has spent in condemning the Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not the Australian government that proposed setting off this bomb in the Pacific; it is not the Australian government that is going to set off the bomb in the Pacific; and the Australian government will never set off an atomic bomb in the Pacific.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other senators will be speaking after me. I hope that the content of their speeches will be directed more towards condemning the real culprit in this matter rather than the government. I think Senator Bob Collins might agree with me on this. If what happens today is that there is a continuation of the condemnation of the Australian government rather than the French government, even someone so open-minded and so free of suspicion as Senator Collins might start taking on board the thought that what really interests people is not so much the outrageous setting off of a bomb by the French in the Pacific, but the opportunity that that has presented for a political play against the present government.

He maintains that the eight planned tests to take place between 1995 and 1996 are entirely irrevocable, so I do not believe that Senator Gareth Evans's deputation to him will have a lot of effect, although I agree that Senator Evans should do all in his power&mdash;and the Australian government should do all in its power&mdash;to change or to turn around the decision of the new president. President Chirac has made this part of his policy, and I believe he is trying to be very hairy chested on this and show the way, but what he is doing is exposing his weakness to the rest of the world. </PARA>

Under the terms of the treaty, five acknowledged nuclear power nations&mdash;Russia, the USA, France, the UK and China&mdash;could retain their weapons while pursuing disarmament policies.

This latest decision will not help to stop that. The decision to recommence nuclear testing effectively means that France has abandoned its special responsibility as a nuclear power state to refrain from testing. Its adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty was crucial to enhancing the possibility of preventing nuclear war by helping to preclude the spread of nuclear weapons to the current non-nuclear weapons states. That is why its decision to recommence nuclear testing in the South Pacific is such a terrible disappointment to us all. </PARA>

I would say probably not and, even if we did, what does it matter how many times over they can kill each one of us? Isn't once enough? These are the most destructive weapons on the face of the earth.

So, instead of immediately contaminating the air and sea around Mururoa and very close to Australia, instead of immediately destroying the lives of thousands of Tahitians and other South Pacific Islanders, they did it in the long term by carrying out these tests underground.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Greens (WA), I would like to give some words of support to the government's proposed resolution on French nuclear testing, but with some provisos. Yes, it would be a good thing if the wording passed in the House of Representatives were to be the wording of the proposal presently before the Senate. However, that does not mean that the proposal could not be added to and improved so that the message could be strengthened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want it put on the record that we have serious reservations about point 5. Those reservations relate to the nature of the agreement. It seems somewhat hypocritical for Australia to be now saying that France's decision undermines the outcome of the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons review. I remind honourable senators that this treaty was being renegotiated during the lead-up to the French election with M. Chirac running on a platform that included being definitely in favour of resuming tests in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nuclear powers wanted indefinite extension to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Senator Gareth Evans presented to this chamber as someone who was busy saving the world by using every possible influence to obtain that indefinite extension. A lot of people would have preferred to see five-year rolling extensions with commitments to weapons destruction because, even though requirements for nuclear control have been in place for many years under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, nuclear weapons have continued to proliferate. There was a concern that unless there was a specific rolling back of the nuclear arsenals under this commitment, negotiated specifically as part of this rolling extension, the signal would be going to the nuclear states that, in reality, they were able to carry on business as usual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nuclear weapons states have used extreme but undefined pressure to bring the non-aligned movement into place on this issue. There was no consensus, despite the kinds of statements that have been made; there was simply an agreement not to go to a vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was right in there up to its ears because our role was to get the non-aligned nations onboard. Australia gave a special dinner. Heaven knows what it was that Australia promised or Australia was obliged to do to assure the non-aligned nations and bring them onboard. I believe that there was a much stronger agreement. If any country signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty Australia, along with other countries, assured them that they would have access to uranium. It did not matter whether or not the nuclear non-proliferation treaty actually delivered disarmament and non-proliferation. It did not matter whether or not the countries which signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty were actually using uranium&mdash;whether from Australia or elsewhere&mdash;in their weapons program, or reselling reprocessed material, as France has been doing for years and years, and proliferating that material. Was part of this deal a guarantee of access to uranium without the sovereign right of countries to make a choice or make a judgment as to whether or not that country was doing the right thing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the seething question. Whilst we have not blocked the consensus in relation to this motion, we want to put it on record that we are very unhappy with point 5 because of the hypocrisy that is encompassed in it. We do not want to be associated with appearing to be happy with the agreement that was reached and Australia's role in delivering that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We said at the time that we thought immediately the agreement was signed there would be a breakdown in the good vows or good words expressed. That is exactly what happened. We had the Chinese testing immediately and we have planned tests by France. We also have a media suggestion that the United States will need to test as well. There have been suggestions in the media that other nuclear states may use this as an excuse to test. How could France go to a treaty for a comprehensive test ban with other nuclear states and say, `We have done ours. Now you have to sign on the bottom line.' The other states will say, `We are not going to sign on the bottom line until we have had our eight tests or our 10 tests.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hardly an argument to say that Australia can be pleased that France will sign the comprehensive test ban treaty after it has had these tests and expect that other countries which may have withheld their testing will suddenly say, `Yes, isn't this a good idea. We will let France have tests and we will sign on the bottom line after France and China have completed their test programs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition was not the least bit interested in contributing much in relation to our concerns about the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Perhaps if the opposition had taken some interest in some of those concerns the government would not have felt so confident that we would all believe that it was going off to save the world. Perhaps we will get more considered debate in the future. We will listen to and watch the government rather than wait and see what the consequences are a few months down the track. </PARA>

We join with the Australian Democrats in looking for a further amendment to recognise the cause and effect of uranium mining and the continued sale of Australian uranium to France. We take that view in consideration of all that we know and have known for some time and especially in relation to the current decision. We signal our support for the amendments proposed by Senator Hill to strengthen this resolution. It is our belief that this resolution would not be complete without calling for the cessation of the supply of uranium to France&mdash;uranium which can be used in France's weapons program and which can be used in the South Pacific for nuclear testing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is massive concern in Australia and in France about the resumption of testing at Mururoa Atoll. AAP has reported the concerns expressed by eminent people in France about the resumption of nuclear testing at the atoll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told that the official reason for this testing is to make sure that the technical advantages of France's nuclear arsenal are kept up to date and in combat readiness. That particular reason does not convince some leading French newspapers, which argue that, rather than there being a technical reason for the testing, the reason is essentially political. I read from the editorial of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Le Monde</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision by Jacques Chirac, the first of any great importance he has made by himself, surprised no one.</PARA>
<PARA>Apparently with the sole exception of Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decisive arguments to justify the breaking of the moratorium respected by four of the five members of the "nuclear club" are not at all technical, they are principally political . . . It remains to be seen if it will be a good decision for Chirac and indeed for France.</PARA>
<PARA>The editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Liberation</EMPHASIS> says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chirac needs a symbol, which grabs attention. Nuclear arms . . . have a type of mystical inheritance for Chirac. The announcement also has a little anti-American theatrics to it (take that Clinton).</PARA>
<PARA>I regret to say that this testing is not being done to advance world peace. It is not even being done for the reasons which have been stated officially by the French government. I suspect that the principal reason is that France has another round of municipal elections coming up. President Chirac sees it as important to attract votes from extreme right groups, and what better way to do it than to announce the recommencement of testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that the French government has not calculated the widespread detestation of this decision in the South Pacific arena. We can only hope that that message is coming through loud and strong. There is no completely safe way to test nuclear weapons. I suppose some ways are safer than others but they all involve risks. In the climate of the post-Cold War phase the risks involved with testing are not acceptable in our part of the world. It is a cliche, but nonetheless it is a persuasive argument, that if this testing was so safe and if, as the French argue strongly, people in our region should not be too concerned about it, why should this not be done on mainland France? The French have not answered that question. It is not sufficient to say, `Years ago we managed to invest all this money in building up our testing facilities in the South Pacific'. If the French government believes in the safety of this testing, it seems to me that it has failed to answer the most obvious question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose from an environmental point of view there are at least four particular things that we can point to which cause concern about the resumption of French testing. The first one involves the possibility of wholesale leakage of lagoon sediments into the ocean which of course has been affected by the nuclear testing. A cyclone, for example, may cause that particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that in 1987 the respected Jacques Cousteau and his group went to the atoll and found what were thought to be large unnatural cracks and fissures in the reef. This would certainly seem to be alarming. Of course, the French claim that the integrity of the coral does not really matter. The French have said that the basalt where the explosions took place is without large fissures, but even they admit that the basalt rock can be fractured up to 400 metres around the bomb site. So there is concern about possible future leakages, some of which may be brought about by unnatural occurrences such as a cyclone or an earthquake in the area which could release to the wider environment the nuclear-affected materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter relates to my earlier comments. There are doubts about the long-term integrity of the underlying basalt rock. There have been some 130 underground tests in the area over the last 20 or so years, and there has been widespread concern about the drilling which is involved as well as the overall effect that this massive degree of underground testing is having on the rock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, one has to accept that there can be accidents with nuclear testing. There has been at least one rather major accident in the area. I quote from a newspaper report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On July 25, 1979, a 120-kiloton weapon was being lowered down an 800m shaft when it became stuck at about 400m. The authorities could not dislodge the weapon and decided to explode it anyway.</PARA>
<PARA>The newspaper report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result was a major underwater landslide of at least 1 million cubic metres of coral and rock. The underwater landslide produced a tidal wave comparable to a tsunami, which injured people on the southern part of Mururoa Atoll.</PARA>
<PARA>People say that they have learned from that particular accident and that that type of accident will not happen again. Nonetheless, I think history shows us there is always a risk, and that certainly causes concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are serious reasons why we are concerned about the testing on the atoll, and the reasons include health aspects. I know some Australian doctors have raised particular health concerns about what they believe are the effects of previous testing on the atoll. As I have just indicated, there are continuing environmental concerns, despite the assurances we have been given by the French government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I join with my colleagues in urging the French government to think again about these tests and to recognise that the advice that it may well have received on the political effects of this decision may have underestimated the strength of feeling throughout the Pacific region regarding the resumption of French testing. It is certainly our hope that the message which will be sent forth from this parliament to the French government will have an effect, and hopefully President Chirac and his ministers will, for good political reasons and, I hope, strong environmental reasons, decide not to proceed with these eight tests. </PARA>

<PARA>I concur with the comments that Senator Margetts made with respect to part 5 of the government's motion. I share her reservations. Nevertheless, the Democrats intend to vote for those seven points, subject to certain qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to ask a couple of questions. What is it that encourages France to use the South Pacific rather than other areas of the world? It comes back to government and opposition policy. It is because of the ambivalence of this government towards the nuclear industry ever since large quantities of uranium were discovered here. But we can also go back to 1987, with the decision to reverse the banning of uranium exports to France and the signing of the lengthy contract between France's EdF and ERA Ranger. This made us particularly vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This says to France that Australia is a bit of a soft touch. It also says that Australia is prepared to put financial gain before world peace. If the government had not taken this action in 1987, I think we would have sent to Mr Chirac and his ilk the sort of powerful message that we needed to send. But, unfortunately, what it means now is that we are vulnerable, we are up to our eyeballs in the industry and we are supplying a material which has the capacity to find its way indirectly to the production of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are one of about 12 countries with uranium. We have some of the largest deposits. We are in the middle range of exporting countries. Our appropriate response should have been to simply say, `No, we are not going to export.' That response is as timely now as it was in 1988, when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 24 June pointed out for all of us in a response to a report by the Australian Safeguards Office about proliferation and its effect, `You can no longer say that Australian atoms of uranium have a high probability of not going into bombs.' At the time, the then minister Kerin said, `The Australian Safeguards Office has advised that the plant in producing low enriched uranium does process both obligated nuclear material which remains in civil use and non-obligated nuclear material which can, after further enrichment, be used for military purposes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the experience with the large German uranium broking company recently showed us, flag or label swapping is an accepted and common part of the industry. The 1988 flag-label swapping episode proved conclusively that by swapping the label `Made in the United States', in which country enrichment to weapons grade is okay, for the label `Made in Australia', it is possible to bypass Australia's written approval requirement for enrichment above 20 per cent. It is okay to have safeguards, but it is so absolutely easy to bypass those safeguards that I wonder what use they are. I would argue that they are rendered useless by quite easily swapping the flags on a shipment of usable Australian uranium and an amount of useless uranium from a country with less strict conditions. Because this is constantly a possibility, the only way we can avoid our responsibility for being a part of this chain and a part of this process is to cease the mining and export of uranium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can signal that the Democrats would support Senator Hill's amendment. But I raise the point that the last part of the amendment about discussing with the United States the possibility of data sharing to remove the public French excuse for tests&mdash;it raises the matter I raised in question time&mdash;we would want to first ascertain from them why they are now talking about testing as a response to the French action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as I said, I am mindful of Senator Ray's comments. I would not expect&mdash;although I am happy to be surprised&mdash;the government and the opposition to vote for the Democrats' amendment, because I understand that they would wish to avoid product differentiation. They would wish to avoid public comment on their own public policy positions, which they have in common, where they have refused to acknowledge the cause and effect linkage. But they cannot keep avoiding acknowledgment of cause and effect forever because, as has happened in so many other important debates in this country&mdash;the woodchip issue is a contemporary example&mdash;the facts catch up with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people understand that sometimes trade arguments and economic arguments are no substitute for moral arguments. That is why, in supporting the government's motion, we do not believe it would have been appropriate to let the discussion go without raising that one fundamental point: if we were not involved in the export of uranium, then we would not have to wear any moral responsibility for our role in the cause and effect in assisting the resumption of testing in the South Pacific. That is an important point to make. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have made a number of statements over the years with regard to nuclear testing. It appears that when a country embarks on this nefarious project truth tends to go out the window. Certainly there is regularly only limited and less than frank disclosure about what in fact is occurring. I believe, from personal knowledge, that that is precisely what occurred when the British were engaged in their nuclear testing at Maralinga.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to digress in respect of these particular areas because I know that this is an underground nuclear testing operation. Nevertheless, the French government has been insistent over many years in its quest to perfect its nuclear arsenal, without proper regard to the effect that that is having on people in the South Pacific and on other nations which may indeed see this as an excuse for attempting to perfect&mdash;again, if that is the correct word&mdash;their nuclear arsenals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It all boils down, in my view, to a fundamental disrespect for human life. Of course, that is not the only area where the French are not upholding the dignity and inestimable value of human life, let alone other forms of life in the environment. For example, when Roussel Uclaf was developing and testing the abortion drug RU486, there was a great deal of outcry against that for the simple reason that that was chemical warfare against the smallest human being; it also was based on a dreadful assertion that the tiniest of human beings was to be regarded as a disease for which a chemical destruction was required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French government took charge of that and, because of its shareholdings in Roussel, insisted that those tests go ahead and they are continuing to go ahead&mdash;in Australia! It all boils down, in my view, to an attitude on the part of the French government which fails to see the importance and the preciousness of human life. And that is so in regard to its attitude on nuclear testing in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been able to look at the motion and the amendment before us. I have no objection to these proposals that have been put before the chamber. I am half inclined, actually, to support the foreshadowed amendment by Senator Kernot. The difficulty with that, of course, is in the effect that it would have on those industries in France and the workers in France who rely on those industries which in turn rely on the export of our uranium. To suddenly cut that off would, or may, have unfortunate effects. I heard what Senator Kernot said and I have not been given anything from what has been said which would indicate that that would definitely not have a very substantial effect on innocent persons, particularly workers in French industries reliant on our export of uranium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome this debate.

There is no necessary dichotomy between what may be a passionate response and what may be a logical response. We are human beings. After all, I would have thought that the French, of all people, might have understood a passionate response.

I will be debating another motion about this matter later this afternoon, so I do not want to transgress onto those areas except to pick up on that point&mdash;that, in doing what the French are about to do, they are undermining the very important process which many of us hoped would lead not just to a test ban treaty but to a total ban on the use of nuclear weapons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French have actually turned that process around. They have taken us back. For that reason, I certainly feel very passionate about this matter. We have already seen that, following their decision, the US is talking about possibly resuming tests. We know that the Chinese are thumbing their noses at the test ban treaty. Bearing in mind that the use of nuclear weapons is so horrific, bearing in mind that if nuclear war should ever begin and there is a bilateral use of nuclear weapons in a war, we are really threatening the future of humankind and all the other species on the planet, as Senator Harradine has just pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the paramount issue on which we must become both logical and very passionate. We must object in the strongest terms to this decision, which is not a decision by the French people or even by the French government, but by the French President. One cannot help contrasting this with the AAP report of what was said by the member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Campbell, who said that one should not get too upset about this. He said that this is not going to cause any great troubles, so why were we becoming concerned? He said, `I am concerned about politicians who raise absolutely groundless fears in the community.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a groundless fear. This is a very well-based fear because the French would not be testing these weapons if they did not intend possibly using the weapons. They would not need to test them if they did not have that as at least a back-up possibility. Given that that is their intention&mdash;to have nuclear weapons with a possibility that they might actually use them&mdash;this is not a groundless fear at all. This is a very well-grounded fear, a very serious fear, and it extends to all those other nations which possess nuclear weapons, particularly those that continue to test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine was talking about French workers. He is evidently unaware of the fact that some years ago the two unions in France which work in the nuclear industry raised serious questions about cracks in French nuclear reactors. Senator Harradine evidently is not aware that those two unions were actively suppressed by the French government from releasing that information to the French community. Senator Harradine perhaps is forgetting that in Australia the decision to go ahead and export uranium was taken&mdash;wrongly, in the view of the Democrats; nonetheless the decision was taken&mdash;after very extensive inquiries. There was the so-called Fox inquiry, otherwise called the Ranger inquiry, a very extensive inquiry begun by the Whitlam government and completed under the Fraser government. It was surrounded by a very intensive and extensive debate in Australia regarding the pros and cons of uranium mining and export and of all things nuclear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">France, however, made its decision to go nuclear in the aftermath of the death of President de Gaulle. There was no public debate in France at all. The French are largely ignorant of the dangers of things nuclear. For those sorts of reasons&mdash;the suppression of the French unions, the failure of France to encourage the sort of debate which went on in Australia during the 1970s and which has continued ever since&mdash;I think the concern over French workers who may be displaced by a ban on uranium exports from Australia is itself misplaced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also significant evidence that French workers have been exposed to high levels of radiation, particularly in the reprocessing industry, and particularly in the attempts by France to develop a breeder reactor. In that respect I think Senator Harradine would be better advised to look to the longer term health of French workers and support the move being made by the Democrats to add to this motion&mdash;and Senator Kernot gave notice of this&mdash;an amendment which would seek to ban the export of uranium to France. Of course, we would support the banning of the export of uranium to all countries. </PARA>

One of the things that we objected to very vigorously during the 1970s, before the Fox inquiry and then later before the Flowers inquiry in Great Britain, the sixth report on nuclear pollution, was that the non-proliferation treaty is compromised in that it requires not only that there be non-proliferation in terms of nuclear weapons, but also that nations possessing nuclear technology, nuclear information and nuclear materials share those materials for so-called civilian purposes with other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Margetts and I would certainly agree, there is no clear line to be drawn between the civilian nuclear program and the military nuclear program. That is one of the fundamental reasons why, since 1977, we have strongly objected to the export of uranium. One cannot be sure where that uranium finishes up. I guess the most recent proof of that is the observation of the strong objections by the US to the provision by Russia of nuclear power stations to Iran. Iran will say, `We want nuclear power. We want a source of electricity energy which is not based on oil. When our oil runs out, we need nuclear energy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the Americans do not believe that the signing of the NPT by Iran is a sufficient guarantee that they will not divert some of that technology into weapons. Why else would they object? Similarly, one has objections&mdash;and I think Australia should have taken this position&mdash;to the Americans and South Koreans providing nuclear reactors to North Korea. I do not think the Japanese are particularly happy. I think the evidence is that, when nations are really pushed on the NPT, they are not happy with the guarantees of nuclear safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning specifically to the motion which the government has moved this afternoon, I have no great difficulty with the first five paragraphs. I do not think they go far enough but one accepts them and one can support them. However, paragraph (6) asks that the Senate, including all its members&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) notes that Australia will do all in its power and . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I am certainly not confident that the government either has done all in its power or will do all in its power. I certainly cannot support those particular words. The government is presuming too much. If the opposition is minded&mdash;and I believe it is&mdash;to support my urgency motion which will be debated immediately after this one, then the opposition is not prepared to accept that the government has done all in its power or will do all in its power. It is not prepared to take the government on trust to that extent. I suspect that Senator Margetts also would not be prepared to take the government on trust, expecting it to do all in its power. So I do not think we should assent to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would anticipate a further amendment in which the first 10 words of paragraph (6) are replaced with the words `calls on the government to'. It would then read, `calls on the government to urge all other countries to hold France to President Chirac's statement' et cetera.  I think one could assent to that. It is placing responsibility on the government; it is making it clear that the Senate expects the government to do that. If the government is prepared to do that&mdash;and, by the wording of its original motion, clearly it is prepared to do that&mdash;it should not object, either. It means that we are putting the government on notice. We are not prepared to take the government at its word because we believe the government has not done all in its power. Just as Senator Kernot gave notice that she will move an amendment after Senator Hill's amendment has been put&mdash;and, I believe, probably passed&mdash;I indicate my intention at the appropriate time to seek to change those words in paragraph (6). </PARA>

We indicate to the Senate, because there is another debate that will follow this one immediately, that we will not be dividing on the opposition amendment. It is clear that the Senate will support that amendment and, therefore, we do not want to unnecessarily waste the time of the Senate in a division, knowing what the result will be. I take the opportunity now of indicating that. </PARA>

I understand from a discussion that I have just had with the opposition that the opposition will not be supporting that amendment either. That has just been confirmed by Senator Calvert. I imagine that the Democrats will be calling for a division on that. Senator Lees has confirmed that. We will not be supporting that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia currently sells a very small amount of uranium to France under contracts between ERA and EdF, which is the publicly owned French power generation company. France has one of the most extensive programs of domestic generation of electricity from nuclear power of any country in the world. All of that exported material is for power generation only. Australian exports of uranium to France are governed by the provisions of the bilateral agreement concerning nuclear transfers between Australia and France, which was entered into in September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This agreement contains binding international undertakings that give effect to Australia's stringent safeguard requirements on exported uranium, including coverage by the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.

Not even the French would subscribe to the view that was put by Senator Kernot that `because we are up to our ears in the industry, we have a compliant attitude toward French testing'. The fact is&mdash;the French government certainly knows it&mdash;that France has an extensive program of domestic generation of electricity from its uranium supplies.

<PARA>The response of the Federal government to the announcement that the French will resume nuclear testing in the Pacific has been and continues to be totally inadequate. It is not commensurate with the outrage felt by the majority of Australians or the many people scattered through the Pacific region. New Zealand has responded in a much more forthright manner to the arrogance of the French. Perhaps if the French had blown up a nuclear protest boat in an Australian harbour, the reaction of our supine government may have been stronger, but given the appeasement approach that this government has shown to Indonesia and other nations that have committed heinous crimes against humanity, one cannot be too sure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French action threatens all humankind. It does so directly through the release of further radioactive material, which will pose a hazard not only to this generation but to many future generations. This is because of the long lived nature of many of the radio nuclides which their tests will release. Of more immediate concern is the threat to the processes of banning forever the use of nuclear weapons. This must start with a total ban on the testing of nuclear weapons. The French action undermines this process in many serious ways. It makes more difficult to argue with nations such as China that it also should stop nuclear testing. The US is now talking of resuming testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a more important flaw in the French claim that it is committed to a test ban, but only after it has conducted another eight tests. The test ban is only one of the steps on the road to a total renunciation of the use of nuclear weapons. Clearly, the French are reserving the right to use nuclear weapons. Why else do they want to ensure that they have the latest and best nuclear weapons in their armamentarium? The French decision thus threatens the very security and survival of all humankind. It puts back the nuclear clock to five minutes to midnight. The weakness of their claim that Polynesia is French territory and that this is the reason they do not conduct tests in France is too transparent to require an answer. If the underground tests are so safe, why not conduct them at home in a similarly deep hole? Economically, it would be much cheaper, but what would the French people say about that?</PARA>

He was and is especially incensed at the disregard shown by the French for the thousands of Australians and people of other nations who gave their lives fighting for France in the war and the thousands more who still suffer as a consequence of injuries sustained in that war. Who is threatening France, he wants to know? Why do we not offer assistance to French colonies in the Pacific to gain their independence, he wants to know? This is the sort of extreme annoyance felt by virtually every Australian person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has our government and the opposition done? This government of ours has tied its own hands in relation to trade sanctions. It has had the support of the opposition at every stage. The French could be murdering their children, mincing them up and turning them into pet food and we could not stop the import of that pet food into Australia unless they were trying to sell it on the Australian market at a price less than the price on the French supermarket shelves. Such is the arrangement that our government has assented to under the GATT and the World Trade Organisation that no amount of moral justification can discharge our overriding obligation to free trade. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You're the one, minister, who is so committed to trade at all costs. The French, through their actions, can threaten the future of humankind yet we may not ban the import and sale of French goods lest we offend the obligation to free trade under the World Trade Organisation. As the Democrats have consistently argued, this is putting too high a price on the sacredness of unfettered market forces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other considerations that should be taken into account when determining whether and to what extent we should trade with other nations. Trade is not a paramount good. The Australian Democrats have argued vigorously against the mining and export of uranium ever since our formation. This was based on both the Ranger report and the UK report on the nuclear industry. Both major independent reports found close links between the civil and military use of nuclear technology. For pragmatic reasons, the Labor Party, which initially endorsed a ban on uranium mining, has had its policy role ignored by a pragmatic Labor government which has replaced the light on the hill with a faint glow of radioactive contamination. In this it has again had the pragmatic support of the opposition. The Australian Democrats urge the government to review its policy and ban uranium exports, starting with exports to France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim that trade boycotts should not be used because trade between Australia and France is small compared with the totality of French trade and that therefore such boycotts would be useless is a morally bankrupt assertion. This would be true of many small nations. Individually they may be small but together they add up to a sizeable part of French trade. The claim is similar to the claim that Australia should do nothing about its greenhouse emissions because we contribute less than two per cent to total world emissions. If this line of reasoning is accepted, it becomes an excuse for doing nothing at all about anything, even in the face of the most serious threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also claimed that such a boycott would harm some Australian businesses and workers dealing in French goods as well as French workers. It is said, `These are innocent bystanders. Any attack on the resumption of nuclear tests must be aimed at the French government.' But who put Mr Chirac into the position in which he can independently commit the world to more nuclear tests? It is the citizens of France. They are the ones who can change the decision if enough pressure is brought to bear through trade sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the Australian end, just as our government can suddenly increase the sales tax on recycled paper and severely and adversely affect an important industry in Australia, so too can the government change the trade arrangements in ways that have adverse influences. As a nation we do not fail to do a thing because it may have some adverse effects. Almost every law passed through this parliament has benefits and costs which are borne by different sections of the public in different degree. We pass these laws believing that the benefits outweigh the costs and that the laws move Australian society in a better direction. In a similar way, if we believe that a strong protest against the French nuclear tests is sufficiently important, we will consider trade sanctions recognising the greater good is thus served. Just as the capital now invested in recycled paper may be forced to relocate into other areas so the capital invested in businesses importing and selling French goods may find its way into other, perhaps Australian, manufactures. The effect of this, just like the increase in the sales tax on recycled paper, will be long term and more likely to effectively reverse the French decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could paraphrase Gareth Evans in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's foreign relations in the world of the 1990s </EMPHASIS>and substitute nuclear weapons for apartheid and France for South Africa. I quote with some licence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We live in a world of many injustices and it may be questioned why a country like Australia should commit so much to an issue so little of our making. But the system of nuclear testing, based as it is on an assertion of French arrogance over the security and welfare of the whole of humankind stands so far beyond the pale that it simply cannot be regarded as just another unpalatable regime. If we in Australia wash our hands of nuclear testing, on the comfortable but indecent justification that it is too far away or too intractable a problem, we would not only have failed in our humanitarian duty, but have debased the very values which are at the core of human survival.</PARA>
<PARA>The response of both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the foreign minister to this most alarming French decision has been pathetic. A trip to Paris and a weak slap on the wrist will not deter the arrogant French. We have seen that with the response today. Much stronger action is needed. The Australian people want much stronger action from our government. In this urgency motion today, the Senate censures the government for its weakness so far and calls on the government to stiffen its response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sometimes, at the end of a long day in the Senate, I think it must in some ways be comfortable to sit on the crossbenches. I must admit I am never tempted to think that it would be comfortable to sit in the opposition but, now and again, because you can advocate everything and not have to implement anything, it is a tempting thought. That is a luxury which governments do not have. It is a luxury which oppositions should not have but which they do sometimes have, and I will come to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government is in fact about making hard choices and difficult decisions, not just about asserting a loosely inter-related series of things which you wish might be true whilst not having to be concerned about the consequences. I have to say that I was going to and will still acknowledge, notwithstanding Senator Coulter's speech, that the Australian Democrats at least have had the virtue of consistency in their opposition to nuclear testing. That is at least a virtue which should be acknowledged in this debate because others here do not have that virtue. Also, in these matters the Democrats have the consistency of advocating more than whatever is being advocated. Whatever might be said, they say that it should be one thing more because they will never have to implement those things which they seek to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was extremely disappointed to find some untrue statements included in some of the attributions Senator Coulter referred to regarding values and attitudes to the government and ministers in particular, probably including me, which I found morally unacceptable, although I do accept the point that trade is not an end in itself. No-one has ever asserted that it is or should be but I do not think it is very healthy, constructive or pleasant to make untrue assertions about what others might do in catastrophic situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also disappointed to hear the enthusiasm with which Senator Coulter was prepared to fight to the last drop of other people's blood. He was prepared to advocate that other people should lose their jobs because it might be in the greater good. Sometimes governments have to make decisions where the benefit of the whole has some disadvantage for the minority. In those circumstances the government's obligation in the normal circumstance is to compensate those people: the beneficiaries should compensate the losers. I listened for the faint echo of that principle, but I missed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very serious question. I am not particularly referring to the motion before us because the collective view of the Senate has been reflected in many irrelevant ways over a long time, and I suspect that this might be another. But the issue at the core of French nuclear weapons testing and the way in which Australia, the region and other countries around the world which are being mobilised against this should most effectively express that concern are important. It is not helped by allusions to the effect that, `If only we think of another cleverer thing we will suddenly get the French to reverse this decision'. It is a question of asking what is the appropriate response for a government in the region which is very strongly opposed to this decision, which has consistently opposed French nuclear testing in the Pacific&mdash;and nuclear testing by other countries&mdash;and which will consistently continue to oppose it. How should this be reflected? At least, as I said, the Democrats and, for the period they have been here, the Greens in their attitudes to the issue of nuclear testing have consistently been opposed to it, and that is to their credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have not always been opposed to testing. There has been a large amount of recitation of the history of their criticism of this government when we sought to take measures to limit nuclear testing in the Pacific. They criticised us for in some ways seeking to undermine the situation of the United States, the French and others in the region. That is very telling but I suppose people are entitled to say, `Look, that was 10 years ago; we are wiser now; we have an alternative view.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be benign and say, `Of course people are entitled to learn, improve and change.' But this change has been a little more dramatic because on Wednesday the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was saying in a very responsible way that the government's response was appropriate. Yet, within 48 hours he was advocating change. Those opposite are now at fever pitch with a desperation for more urgent measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If what we were doing on Wednesday was appropriate, how in 36 hours can it be a fundamental requirement that this response be changed, that now we are to take action that is not appropriate&mdash;that goes beyond what was acknowledged to be an appropriate response? It was appropriate at the time when the interpretation of the decision was much weaker than the reality. The public had not perceived all the elements of the decision but, even so, the Leader of the Opposition was prepared to say it was appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt why this change has taken place. It is the very opposite of leadership; it is the perception of a political opportunity because of public concern or what Senator Coulter called extreme annoyance&mdash;which I am not sure captures the spirit but, for consistency, I will use that phrase&mdash;at the arrogance of the French government reflected in this decision, at the complete denial of the rights of people in this region and about the commitments the French government made to exercise utmost restraint in the agreement on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and its recent extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A political opportunity was seen. All leadership and responsibility was abrogated, in a 36-hour switch, to pursue enthusiastically where a vote might lie. The government's position has been clear from the very start. It was always clear and we have always delivered an unequivocal message to the French. We delivered it, contrary to the inaccurate assertion by Senator Hill at question time, before President Chirac was elected president and after he was elected president, in an attempt to influence the decision-making process before it was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always easier to do that than to change decisions after they have been made. We set out to seek to influence that decision. I do not know of any other country that was doing it; as far as I know, we were the only one. Let us not pretend that even if there had been 10 countries supporting us we would have changed President Chirac's mind. The comments he made during the election seemed to be inexorably leading to this conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it was appropriate to seek to do that, to point out the commitments that had been entered into, the concerns of Australia, the implications for the region and the implications in the region for France&mdash;not that the implications for France are our concern, but we hoped that might be an effective way of persuading the French government that it was not in its interests to act in this way. Since the decision was made there has been an initial statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the decision&mdash;which is always brushed aside when it does not suit, but which is not unimportant&mdash;to call in the ambassador and to send our ambassador in to deliver the protests. </PARA>

That is not a bad start. Those are the three most appropriate forums. The first two have been in session; the UN is not yet. This has been done in concert with the South Pacific nations and is part of the process of trying to mobilise the maximum international opinion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Japanese government is one of the major influential governments in the world. It made its views clear very forthrightly to the French government in terms very similar to our own. It did that not because we asked, but because it is the appropriate and sensible policy of the Japanese government. That it was not successful does not mean we do not appreciate that that government did it. That we were not successful does not mean that the Japanese do not appreciate the fact that we did it. We both think it is the appropriate course of action, as do other countries in the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have set out to be consistent in advocating the policy of the Australian government with regard to this matter but have set out to do so in a way that deals with concerns of France and is directed towards the interests of France, not towards punishing Australia or South Pacific nations, the innocent parties. If, for example, we were to cut all defence ties with France, we would no longer be able to provide the humanitarian assistance and surveillance which are of great value to the countries of the South Pacific. We intend to continue to provide that&mdash;and they want us to. Nor are we going to take action on the trade front that will cost jobs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a matter over which it is appropriate to punish Australians. We have no intention of doing so; we have never had any intention of doing so. If Australians wish to take action by direct protests within the law, we support that. If they wish to take action by mobilising their consumer power, we support that. We will continue to provide leadership in terms of a balanced, appropriate response that comes from a government with a long and consistent record, since 1983, of opposing French nuclear activity in our region. Their action throws into question the whole legitimacy of French involvement in this region. We will continue to raise those issues and speak up for the interests of Australia, but not in a way that jeopardises the interests of Australia and Australians. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth looking at some comments made by Mr Padraic McGuinness in last Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What President Chirac of France has done is to indulge in a supremely cynical exercise in domestic politics, using nuclear testing in the same manner, though on a much greater scale, as Paul Keating uses republicanism to bolster his own support.</PARA>
<PARA>It is just as cynical and just as disgraceful. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as Paul Keating has taken over the Left of the Labor Party by his cynical exploitation of the republican issue, so Jacques Chirac is bidding to take over the Right of French politics by giving the French an issue which will swamp their racism and their fear of European federalism.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with Mr McGuinness. There is no doubt that President Chirac's action is a supremely cynical exercise. It does relate to domestic politics. I do not think it has any significance in terms of France's nuclear power. Senator Coulter is jumping at shadows in suggesting that. This is a domestic political stunt just like the republican matter of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;I almost said `President Keating'&mdash;is a domestic political stunt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was intrigued to hear today the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) say that the opposition is expressing a much stronger view about nuclear testing now than it did 10 years ago when the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was previously our leader. It is interesting that in those days there was a cold war. There was a stand-off between the major nuclear powers. Times have changed a lot since 1985. I remember that in 1985 someone called Mr Paul Keating favoured a GST. So times have definitely changed since then. It is all right for the Labor Party to change its position, even though the facts have not changed in that case, but it is quite wrong for the Liberal Party to change its position when the world scene has changed dramatically. Let us hear no more of that sort of nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us recognise that we should be demanding, not just seeking, an unequivocal assurance from France that it will sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty without reservation in autumn next year. That should be central to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) is supposed to be doing on his little trip to Paris. I have not heard that that is central to his trip. It simply ought to be. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to acknowledge that this justification by the French that it is only exploding eight more nuclear devices because they will soon be signing the treaty and will no longer explode any bombs is a concession about which we ought to demand reassurance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am concerned about the levels of over-reaction by some people in Australia. Terrorists have burnt a consulate and so on. People who talk about fears of an adverse effect on health in the region, for example, really overstate the issue in order to create some kind of hysteria. This was pointed out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian </EMPHASIS>editorial:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The publicity and public backlash to the French tests contrasts interestingly with the much more muted response to the latest Chinese testing. Keating's statement on Wednesday recalled the Chinese had conducted a test on 15 May, immediately after the test ban treaty negotiations. This prompted a strong protest from Australia at the time and another reprimand in the Keating statement. But it did not generate anything like the public outrage the French tests have.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vehemence of the public response is because the government's response has been so inadequate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, like my colleague, disassociate myself completely from the over-the-top remarks Senator Coulter made in speaking first in this debate. Like Senator Baume, I agree with the sentiments of the motion moved by Senator Coulter, if not his arguments. It really is a question of too little too late. Senator McMullan tried to give the best spin to what he says the government could possibly have done and what it has done. But, like most things the Labor Party does, nobody really believes him. It is a shame it is the case with this government that nobody believes anything it says nowadays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to have been this flurry in the last few days since the announcement was made. The Labor Party has suddenly realised that this is a major political issue in Australia, and it then determined that something needed to be done. There are many things it could have done before the announcement was made. Senator McMullan and Senator Gareth Evans and most of those people should have realised that, once the French made the public announcement that these testings were to continue, it would be very difficult for anyone to change the minds of the French people and the French government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had Senator Evans been interested in this, had he focused on it before that announcement was made, maybe the sorts of things that he is doing now could have been done at that particular time. If he had taken the Australian public into his confidence, maybe then the Australian public could have demonstrated, before the decision was made, just what their views were. Maybe something could have come out of that that would have assisted in having the French not make that formal announcement. So my concern is that this government, the Labor Party, has done far too little, and it has been far too late that it has done it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that my colleague Senator Baume has mentioned that there is, of course, no point in pursuing and propagating theories and fears that will not eventuate. He mentioned, in particular, the health concern. Whilst I acknowledge what Senator Baume says, I say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that in the north of Queensland, where I come from, along the northern coastal area there is a real concern&mdash;perhaps it is not scientifically based&mdash;that in some way the French testing underground will affect weather patterns in North Queensland. This may be irrational. It may not be based upon any scientific fact, but it is a matter that does concern many people who live upon the North Queensland coastal area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Constituents have reminded me&mdash;and I have not had the opportunity to look into this and refresh my memory on the actual facts, but you, Mr Acting Deputy President, as a Queenslander, might recall the facts&mdash;that on the Atherton Tableland 10 years or so ago there was some evidence of some nuclear fallout that got into the grass and was eaten by the dairy cattle and ended up in the milk supplies that Milanda milk was distributing at that time. This is going back quite some time. What the factual basis and the scientific basis of that was, I do not know. I have not had the opportunity of researching it, but it is something that has been raised with me quite a number of times in the last two to three days, particularly in that part of Far North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So people are genuinely concerned. They would have hoped that their government could have done something about this before the French got themselves into a position where I do not think there is any resiling. Once that decision has been made, once the face has been shown, it is very difficult for them to change their position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also very concerned that, as it turned out from question time today, Senator Ray&mdash;although he was so equivocal about it that it was difficult to find out just what his position was&mdash;seemed to dissociate himself. It seems that the government does not share&mdash;I think this was the final stage it got to&mdash;Senator Evans's view that, `Oh, well, it could have been a lot worse.' To me, it seems that that sort of insensitiveness is something that really the government or Senator Evans should apologise for&mdash;he is not here; he is overseas&mdash;that complete insensitivity of suggesting, `Well, it could have been a lot worse than it is.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating today the government response to the resumption of French nuclear weapons testing. And yes, it is both weak and inadequate, but it is interesting to see today that both of the major parties are responding to the quite clear public response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A representative from a magazine rang me a few days ago and asked me if I would write down the answers to 10 questions put to me in relation to the proposed resumption of French nuclear testing in the Pacific. They said, `What we usually do is get one person on either side of the argument to provide answers to these questions.' They said, `We're having a lot of trouble, however, finding anyone who will provide the other side of the argument.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly why we are here today. We are not here today because either of the major parties has suddenly discovered a conscience about nuclear issues. We are here today because it is accepted that it is a very strong electorate issue, and that is very important. Some people think, because the anti-nuclear movement has been small in resources, that it has gone away and that, in fact, the issues have gone away. The reality is no, the issues have now become mainstream; and the trouble is that the government failed to recognise them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">France is the major reprocessor of plutonium from nuclear reactors. The primary function of reprocessing is to build nuclear weapons. Countries do not need to reprocess plutonium for their nuclear reactors: they can use uranium. Whichever way Australian uranium is sold to France, it can be used to produce plutonium in nuclear reactors which is enriched in reprocessing plants in France and which may be shipped overseas. The reality is that the nonsense I have been hearing&mdash;`Well, it's only a little drop in the ocean. We don't have to take responsibility. It might hurt a few jobs.'&mdash;is actually closing your eyes to the fact and saying that there is a small amount of morality&mdash;a bit like being a bit pregnant. We are going to be either moral or ethical in this, or we are not. It seems that the government is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a major contributor to the spread of nuclear weapons in France, the nuclear weapons states and nuclear powered countries with nuclear weapons aspirations. Giving a country nuclear technologies is akin to giving it nuclear weapons potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last eight years, the federal government has given permission for enough plutonium of Australian origin to be separated for the construction of 250 nuclear weapons. This figure is based on figures in the annual reports of the Australian Safeguards Office, which show that since 1986 the Australian government has given permission for spent fuel containing 327 tonnes of Australian origin uranium to be reprocessed. This has allowed for the separation of approximately 2.88 tonnes of weapons-useable plutonium, which is enough to construct at least 250 nuclear weapons. If all spent fuel containing Australian uranium were reprocessed, the amount of plutonium separated would rise to a massive 14 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The separation of plutonium from reprocessing does not go into reactors. Greenpeace has estimated that by the year 2010 stockpiles of commercially separated plutonium by reprocessors, including France, will be greater than the plutonium contained in the world's nuclear weapons and military stockpiles; that is, in excess of 500 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has consent mechanisms in place to allow the retransfer and reprocessing of Australian origin uranium and nuclear materials. These are bilateral agreements with countries, including France. They are treaty level documents and are tabled in parliament only after signing. The working detail is contained in separate administrative arrangements, which are kept secret at the request of customer countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has Australia not withdrawn its commitments to allow reprocessing of Australian origin nuclear material? It is because Australia hides behind the fallacy that the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards will prevent countries from using Australian nuclear material for non-peaceful purposes. It allows customer countries, such as Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the United States, to reprocess Australian nuclear material under so-called safeguards claiming that reprocessing is `associated with efficient energy use'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Safeguards, however, clearly do not work. Their inadequacy was spelt out clearly by Hans Bliz, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in 1982, when he said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the world of foreign affairs and in the art of diplomacy, words are bullets and timing is absolutely everything. Our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) boasts of having both skills but, in representing this government, he has failed in both. This government has failed to lead Australia and failed to lead the region, and that has been detrimental to our standing in the region and within the international community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should not believe that its response to the French nuclear testing will not be noticed by the international community because the inadequacy of its response is a recognised pattern of this government in many other issues. That is why my colleagues and I support the urgency motion moved by the Australian Democrats condemning the weak and inadequate response of the government to the resumption of French nuclear weapons testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should add that the parliament is united in condemning the fire bombing of the French consulate in Perth. Thankfully, no-one was injured by that act of terrorism, but in condemning it we must remember the attack on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rainbow Warrior</EMPHASIS> and make the following distinctions: the attack here was not government inspired; there was no loss of life; it has been soundly condemned by this parliament and all Australians; and no hero status has been given to the terrorists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As outlined in question time today by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill, Australia had timing on its side but we failed to take advantage of it. When the government sent its letter par avion to the French foreign affairs office some months ago it had timing on its side because it knew this decision was coming. However, instead of taking advantage of that timing, it clearly signalled to the French government its inadequate and weak response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation that is now in Paris&mdash;we wish them well&mdash;should have gone weeks if not months ago, particularly with the knowledge that this decision was coming. That is the point, Senator McMullan, that we are making: you do not wait for the decision; you lay down the strongest possible protest and outline the actions that you will take. If the French think you are not going to take any action, they will ride roughshod over you, which is exactly what they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, simultaneous with the posting of that letter to the French government, meekly protesting the possibility of resumption on nuclear testing, the Australian government sent a very warm invitation to the French to join the South Pacific forum which, ironically, will occur at the same time as the first nuclear test at Mururoa. That would be a marvellous, hot-headed meeting if the French, at Australia's invitation, were to turn up to that forum, just when the first bomb is going off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of the government's very weak and meek words prior to the French government announcement, is it any wonder that when we pick up the papers today we read that the French government has dismissed the protest and that the delegation led by Senator Evans is to be snubbed as outrage grows. The French government knew exactly how to respond to the Australian government and any delegation after its announcement of its decision because Australia never set out clearly enough its possible course of action. The French were pre-warned of our reaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the latest <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program there was a very interesting documentary about the health effects of years of nuclear testing in the vicinity of those South Pacific islands, particularly Tahiti. We heard tragic stories of child deformities and, while we cannot prove for certain a connection with the testing, there is a very convincing argument for doing so. If, over some 20 years, you are exploding bombs 10 to 20 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, there are grounds for linking certain of the health problems suffered by the Tahitians and other islanders directly to the nuclear testing, regardless of the French scientists' propa ganda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government's timing was out. The wording used by Senator Evans will probably go down as the most memorable, most infamous statement ever by a foreign minister&mdash;`It could be worse'. For all his experience, for all the time that he has been in this job, for all his boasting, for all the books he has ever written, not only did this minister mistime the protest but his words also failed him.

I really have to pick up the previous speaker, Senator McGauran, on the comments he made about a `meek' protest. I do not think anyone on either side of the chamber would accuse Senator Gareth Evans of being meek, if that is what Senator McGauran was suggesting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, we are all agreed that there is no place for the resumption of French nuclear testing in the Pacific. I agree with many of the concerns that have been expressed in the chamber today. By and large, there has been some very positive debate. But while I agree with a number of the concerns that have been expressed by speakers in the debate on Senator Coulter's urgency motion, I cannot support that motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion suggests that the Australian government's actions are of no use in getting President Chirac to change his policy. It is quite inaccurate. Clearly, we must be united. I know that it is always tempting for those of us in this place to score political points. That is the name of the game and that is the role of those in opposition. However, something as significant as this subject&mdash;a subject that has seen unprecedented unity from the electorate&mdash;requires us to be a little more tolerant of each other's views and a little more aware of the difference between being in government and not being in government instead of trying to point score over what actions the government may or may not have taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it weak, for example, to lead a top level delegation of South Pacific nations to formally lodge a united protest from our region? I am sure Senator Coulter does not think that that is weak. Is it really inadequate to call for a boycott of French products, to freeze defence ties, and to refuse refuelling of aircraft facilities for those involved in the tests?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, Senator Coulter, you would like to see us go further&mdash;and probably so would I. But it is inappropriate to use this as an occasion to pass a motion of this kind. The Australian government must continue to be pro-active in trying to get a reversal of this decision. In their arrogant way the French regard the Pacific as their own property&mdash;to do with as they will. As many people have said throughout the past few days, if this testing is so important why are the French not doing it on their own shores? Indeed, why are the French not taking up the American offer to use the facilities in Nevada?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate to mention some of the many responses that have occurred over the last few days. I have three pages of them, but I am not going to attempt to cover them in my final few minutes. I want to single out a few. The Australian Medical Association has stated that increased incidence of thyroid cancer in Australia could be directly linked to French tests in the Pacific and has urged French doctors to lobby the Chirac government to reverse its decision to resume testing. That is very significant. The Australian Medical Association does not lightly take such action. Similarly, the Pacific Asia Travel Association has called for a protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there are other measures that the Australian government should be taking and I would like to mention them. We should be considering the recall of our ambassador. We should be considering calling an emergency meeting of the South Pacific Forum. We could refuse to enter into defence contracts with the French. We could refuse to allow French corporations to tender for government contracts. Most importantly, we certainly should be reviewing existing uranium contracts with France. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Standing Committee's report examines some of the complex issues spanning the full range of the Commonwealth Government's involvement in social policy broadly defined. Due to the wide ranging scope of the inquiry the Committee identified a number of salient issues on which attention could be focused and targeted two key Commonwealth departments&mdash;the Departments of Social Security and Human Services and Health. The report provides a synoptic view of recent developments and reforms within these Departments in relation to these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the report does not make specific recommendations, it draws a number of conclusions about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.consultation with the community;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.planning processes;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.development of a regional focus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report provides a useful summary of the progress of reforms in these Departments and identifies some issues that need further consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes that the Committee's report complements the more focused and in-depth inquiries conducted into related issues by other parliamentary committees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Consultation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government regards effective community consultation as an essential step in ensuring that service delivery is more flexible and responsive to clients. Significant advances have been made in recent years in the adoption of a client-focused approach to the planning and delivery of services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent developments include establishment of a national network of Older Australians Advisory Councils to provide advice on matters relating to the care and well being of older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These new Councils have replaced the Consumer Forums for the Aged which finished operation at the end of 1993. The role of the Advisory Councils is to consider the needs and concerns of older people and the effectiveness and relevance of Commonwealth government services or funding in meeting those needs. They will also examine the roles that older Australians play in family and community life, including their roles as carers and as active citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Councils will put the views of older people to the Minister, and will also report back to older Australians and their organisations on the deliberations and activities of the Councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Widespread community consultations have also recently been carried out to inform the Strategic Review of the Disability Services Program. The consultation process will lead to changes in the quality of outcomes for people with a disability. Information gathered from the consultations has fed into an interim report which recommends a package of structural reforms for the Disability Services Program focusing on providing choice and meeting individual needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Women's Council Project, funded under the User Rights Initiatives Program, is an example where the expertise, experience and local knowledge of a community based organisation has been used to examine the aged care needs of a particular community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Women's Council has received a grant to undertake a project to identify and examine the needs and problems facing the aged in member communities and Homelands of the Pitjantjatjara Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council employs a research team to undertake the project. The project officer is an anthropologist who has worked for many years on the Pitjantjatjara Homelands and she is assisted by an Aboriginal worker/interpreter. The field work involves visiting all member communities of the Women's Council to hear from the older people what aged care services they need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Human Services and Health Portfolio, the Aged and Community Care Program's strategy for improving the provision of aged care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities was developed in co-operation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, Australian Hearing Laboratories and other Government agencies. This followed consultations with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and communities across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strategy stresses the importance of thorough needs assessment, including obtaining the views of potential clients and their families, and communities' involvement at all stages of service planning, development and delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More generally, community consultations on a regional basis are becoming a more frequent part of ongoing program operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Planning Processes</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises the utility of needs-based analysis and planning as a framework for identifying client needs, in particular, special needs and emerging forms of need, and how those needs vary from region to region and from client group to client group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the mid-1980s, needs-based planning has been used as the basic framework for identifying client needs for community services programs. More sophisticated program-specific needs-based planning processes are now being developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's Family and Children's Services Program uses a nationally consistent statistical data base on the supply of and demand for child care services, supplemented by additional information gained from State Planning Advisory Committees and local consultations, in its needs-based planning of child care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Disability Services Program is developing a data collection on ethnicity and culture to assist in the provision of appropriate services&mdash;the National Information Management System. The implementation of the System in funded services over the next twelve months will enable the Program to collect good quality statistical data, allowing it to undertake a more detailed analysis of the Program's clients and their needs. This will inform and assist in the development, implementation and monitoring of the Program's access and equity strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of collecting ethnicity data is also recognised by the Aged Care Program, which is currently developing new data collection methods. These will improve the level and quality of information, enhance planning and monitoring, and ultimately lead to better service provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such program-specific needs-based planning processes are complemented by regional needs analyses. The development of regional needs analyses provides a mechanism for building a regional perspective into program-planning processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Integral to the success of this process is improved community consultation and a more widespread regional presence. Instead of looking at needs and priorities for individual programs in isolation, needs and priorities across a whole range of responsibilities are examined across regions. In the Human Services and Health Portfolio, the regions are supported by a growing network of regional offices which builds on earlier regionalisation experiments in Queensland and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regional Needs Analyses will help ensure programs are able to equitably meet the needs of all members of the community including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, women, people in rural and remote areas, people from a non-English speaking background, and those with a disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Service Delivery</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Recruitment Strategy in the Human Services and Health Portfolio is particularly complementary to the development of service models which are more responsive to the needs of these communities. The Strategy was developed by indigenous staff in 1991 and has provided a range of opportunities that have enabled indigenous people to access employment within the Department. It is envisaged that as more indigenous people gain access to the Department, they will increase their input to the delivery of the Department's programs to ensure cultural appropriateness and equitable access for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendations coming from the Strategic Review of the Disability Services Program will also see a focus on providing consumer choice and meeting individual needs, and the achievement of outcomes as the primary measure of service delivery performance. These will result from the introduction of portable, individualised, funding for consumers, a greater range of support services, better wages and employment conditions, and a greater emphasis on the provision of quality services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further example is the National Child Care Strategy on cost-sharing arrangements with State and Territory Governments. Under this arrangement, some child care places are being delivered through innovative arrangements which best meet the needs of families in rural and remote areas. Extensive consultation has been undertaken in developing appropriate service-delivery models. A further initiative in the 1995-96 Budget to develop innovative community managed places in remote communities provides increased flexibility of funding arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other current initiatives to address barriers to more responsive service delivery include revision of legislation administered, to reduce its complexity and make it more accessible to service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the Law Reform Commission is reviewing the Department of Human Services and Health's program legislation and has issued two discussion papers on Aged Care and Child Care and one report on Child Care. The first of the new legislation is expected this year on Aged Care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ways of overcoming administrative and legal barriers to more flexible funding arrangements are also being examined, particularly for small or isolated communities. This will enable the range of services provided to be more responsive to community needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A review of administrative arrangements, particularly in relation to contracting of services, is underway to ensure value for money whilst maintaining accountability and service quality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Home and Community Care Program</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is keen to ensure that guidelines for programs are sufficiently flexible to enable service providers to deliver services in a flexible manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report is critical of the Home and Community Care Program's inflexible guidelines, which are considered to hamper service provision by local community-based organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These issues are being addressed through the current Efficiency and Effectiveness Review of the Home and Community Care Program. The Review is addressing the need to increase the flexibility of the Program in responding to community needs, while improving accountability between levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Home and Community Care Program is further complicated by the nature of the relationship between the Commonwealth and State/Territory Governments, as joint partners in the Program. Any change in the Program's administrative structure, consultation process and service-delivery practices must first be negotiated with, and agreed to, by the States and Territories. This is often a difficult and time-consuming task, made more complex by the very real differences that exist between States/Territories in terms of their consumer and service provision profiles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Regional Focus</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Different approaches to regionalisation have been adopted by the Departments of Social Security and Human Services and Health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extensive decentralisation/regionalisation of Department of Social Security offices has gone hand in hand with a devolution of responsibilities to regional office managers, to allow them to allocate resources and prioritise operations according to local needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992, the Department of Human Services and Health commenced a service planning and delivery strategy with the aim of improving access to, and the responsiveness of, its programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the regional focus strategy, a number of regional offices were established throughout Australia. The regional office network now comprises 18 offices, the majority of which are located in rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major evaluation of the regional focus strategy was completed in February 1994. The evaluation found that a regional presence by the Department made a significant and positive difference in the areas of planning, service development and service support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An examination of the Department of Human Services and Health's office structures is currently in progress with a view to further consolidating its regional presence to ensure equitable geographic access to funded services, clients, service providers and administrators.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Introduction</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its second report, tabled in Parliament on 16 December 1993, the Committee has reached a number of conclusions, and has made three specific recommendations. The conclusions recognise the action that had been taken reforms which had been introduced by the former Department of Transport and Communications to address the issues rectify the problems identified in the Pearce Reports. Subsequent to the administrative changes which involved the separation of the former Department, progress in implementing the changes has continued in the Department of Communications and the Arts, and in the Department of Transport. The Committee's recommendations form the basis for building on the improvements to date.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts the conclusions drawn by the Committee in its second report, the main thrust of which were to the effect:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Specific problems were identified in respect of the Satellite Pay TV and MDS tendering processes, as a result of certain shortcomings in some of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(former)</EMPHASIS> Department's operations and procedures at that time</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.An integral part of the responsibility and accountability issues considered in the Committee's first report was the need to take action to rectify these problems, and to ensure that systems were enhanced in order to prevent their recurrence. The remedial and preventative measures the former Department has taken have sought to address all aspects of its management, and these actions do address the problems identified. The Committee believes that in these terms, the Minister has properly discharged his responsibilities through the action he and the Department have taken to rectify the problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Valuable lessons have been learnt from these events, and the Committee recognised the potential for the service-wide application of the remedial material developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The effectiveness of the action which has been taken must, ultimately, be judged over a period of time, and in this respect, the Committee notes the importance of the evaluation and review mechanisms which have been put in place.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in cooperation with other agencies and industry, develop a comprehensive description of both defence industry and defence exports;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response to Recommendations 1, 2 and 3</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed-in-principle. In spite of the fact that there is a general consensus on the broad aspects of the nature of Australian defence industry and the value and composition of Australia's defence exports, general agreement as to a definition for defence exports is a vexatious issue. Following earlier less fruitful attempts, the question was addressed and widely consulted in the Defence Policy and Industry Report of November 1992 (The Price Report). The Government will work to improve on some distortions identified in Chapter 2 of the Committee report. However, the effectiveness of any control regime depends in part on the ability of industry to manage and comply with its procedures. So setting too complex a series of procedures and definitions could be self-defeating. In fact, any extension of the current basis of data collection could well impede, by virtue of additional documentary requirements, industry's abilities to ensure timely  delivery of exports to highly competitive international markets. Finally, it is  recognised that the definition of what constitutes a defence export is evolving. Goods exported for military use are becoming increasingly, perhaps predominantly, commercially useful, often at the leading edge of technology.  Goods used for defence purposes are increasingly `civilian' in nature, ie. not made to military specifications. On the question of control of defence services, see the response to Recommendation 12.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 4</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. As indicated in the White Paper 1994, "Defending Australia",  the Government accords a high priority to considering matters of national and regional security in the exports decision making process. It will continue to do so. In fact, these matters are clearly identified as criteria to be considered in the Australian Controls on the Export of Defence and Related Goods&mdash;Guidelines for Exporters. When weighing up the implications of defence exports, particular emphasis will be placed on assessing their potential impact on our planning for the Defence of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 5</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian controls on the export of defence and related goods be reviewed every five years by the committees responsible for defence exports in consultation with representatives from defence industries and non-government organisations responsible for conflict resolution; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed-in-principle. The Government currently undertakes periodic reviews of Australian export controls in accordance with its international obligations under a number of multilateral control regimes.  We are an active, well-reputed, member of the international export controls community. Defence and DFAT already provide opportunities for consultation with defence industry and non-government organisations respectively and endeavour to take account of the views received as far as practicable. In March 1994,  the Department of Defence published new "Australian Controls on the Export of Defence and Related Goods&mdash;Guidelines for Exporters".  These guidelines revised earlier policy published in March 1992 and June 1989.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response to recommendations 7, 8 and 9</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not agreed. The Standing Inter-Departmental Committee on Defence Exports (SIDCDE), established in 1989, purposefully has a widely based cross representational make up, including DFAT.  Individual members are expected to table their Departmental positions in the course of SIDCDE deliberations which are not expected to be of one accord given the disparate Departmental roles and responsibilities. DFAT has the opportunity to review the more sensitive export applications  for defence goods and bring to bear their perspective in the course of SIDCDE deliberations. In addition, informal consultations occur between Defence and DFAT officials on a range of export control cases on a daily basis. The interdepartmental Committee on Defence Materiel Cooperation and Exports advises Ministers on the array of policy issues arising from proposals to export advanced technologies and services and to engage in collaborative ventures with regional countries. The Interdepartmental Committee on defence Materiel Cooperation and Exports is a valuable additional safety net, as its main objective is to develop an integrated approach for handling collaborative projects and `big ticket' and potentially sensitive exports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not agree with the Committee's conclusion that DFAT will "benefit" from reviewing all export applications, nor does it see the value added in such proposed review. This would, on the contrary, institutionalise duplication of work across two Departments as the proposed computer link would not convey sufficient information with respect to individual applications to DFAT officials. For a meaningful review , transmittal of  complete dossiers, as is done on Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Defence Exports cases, would be required. Additional regulatory mechanisms would add complexity to the export control regime by increasing the number of bureaucratic checks on defence exports. Resource requirements will increase, as will the level of ambiguity for industry applicants.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed-in-part. Subject to improving the details of defence export reporting,  the  Government will investigate making the Annual report even more informative. This must be balanced against recipient nations' desires for confidentiality in their defence import activity. As an example of an improvement, details on the time it takes to process applications can be included. The Annual report will be tabled within six months.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Position Reserved. In making this recommendation, the Sub-Committee acknowledged that, " to its credit, the ACS had recognised the problems in this area and had initiated a review of the whole export control process" . The review has now been completed and is currently being considered by Customs senior management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While defence exports are obviously an important category of restricted goods, Customs would use the same strategies for controlling them as it would for any other type of restricted  exports such as native fauna, illicit drugs, etc. These strategies include using risk management techniques which involve targeted physical examinations based on intelligence reports and post-shipment documentary checks to confirm the accuracy of data being supplied to Customs electronically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACS is in a period of significant change following the Government's decisions in regard to the Conroy Review. Customs senior management is currently examining the report of the review of exports controls in the context of these changes.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed-in-principle. The Commonwealth already controls the export of some defence services. For example, under the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978. The  Weapons of Mass Destruction Bill, recently presented in Parliament, proposes to cover services  provided for WMD programs of concern. Overseas practices, including those agreed to in multilateral fora, will be researched with a view to implementing complementary controls over select defence services when appropriate. The definitional question about what constitutes a defence service, as well as the concern about extraterritorial application of Australian law, remain  issues the Commonwealth will consider in its on-going deliberations on defence exports.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not agreed. The 1994 White Paper, "Defending Australia", is now the key document describing the Government's defence industry policy, one aspect of which is defence export facilitation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. The practice of endorsing products is generally consistent with Commonwealth procurement policy including the reforms announced in "Working Nation", the White Paper on employment and economic growth.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed-in-principle. In the context of the procurement process, defence exports are tied to a broader range of industry issues. Defence is working on an on-going basis to improve its processes in this area. However, because of the complexity of many of Defence's procurement activities, especially in relation to major acquisitions, it would be impossible to identify a clear point at which it could be said that Defence's export and procurement activities were integrated. Assessment of export considerations in the procurement process will continue to be made on a case-by-case basis in the context of consideration of  broader industry issues as well as national and regional security issues.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.  In light of the recent Burgess Review of business programs and the establishment of Aus Industry, the Government believes it is appropriate to improve its interdepartmental coordination of export and enterprise improvement programs for SMEs in the defence industry sector.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed-in-part. Cost recovery is a complex issue. Many factors, such as strategic value, and the ability of the stakeholder to pay, need to be considered. In Defence services , which are in a broad sense, supportive of exports, are delivered by a wide number of players across the entire Departmental  and ADF spectrum not just by the area called the Defence Export Program.  Defence, in delivering services to industry, will seek to have industry and Defence share the costs according to the benefits accruing to each party.  Increased support capabilities for the ADF, capital savings, reduced maintenance costs and production economies of scale  are a few examples of benefits which Defence takes into account.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed-in-part. See response to Recommendations 1, 2 &amp; 3 of the Majority Report. The November 1994 guidelines for exporters called the "Australia's Controls on the Export of Technology with civil and military applications" include a new category of controls listing some products of potentially repressive use. On the issue of  possible expansion of items listed on the voluntary UN Arms Register, it should be noted that signatories have failed to concur on further extended coverage. The Government notes the concerns of some Australian interest groups that current export controls are not considered as stringent as they would like. Definitional problems are vexatious and it is unlikely that all societal interests will be satisfied with efforts to classify goods for export control purposes. The Commonwealth does not believe a Joint Parliamentary Select Committee is the appropriate mechanism or has the relevant practical expertise to deal with definitions of defence exports. As indicated in earlier replies to the Majority recommendations, the Commonwealth aims to improve the transparency of the defence export control system but does not intend to substantially overhaul the current approach. The Government is committed to reviewing practices of statistical reporting on controlled goods to more accurately reflect export levels. Improvements will be made before and after the audit by the Australian National Audit Office, where indicated.

The Government does not agree, on the contrary, consideration of any specific criteria should not dominate the export application approval process. We emphasise that the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Defence Exports provides a forum for consultation and DFAT input on policy and process developments for defence export applications. Reviewing every application in two separate departments has no added benefits and could unreasonably delay  exports to competitive markets, to the point that the regulatory process renders exports commercially not viable. In circumstances where sensitive exports are under consideration Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Defence Exports provides a mechanism of checks and balances and, also, establishes a forum where a broad range of Australian interests are weighed against specific export proposals. All member Departments participate actively in the process and DFAT expertise in relevant areas is recognised as a matter of long-standing practice.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulation of services and of components is an area requiring close examination and a clear set of guidelines. This should be accomplished as a matter of urgency. Services should be defined and regulation proposed. Of particular concern is  the regulation of services relating to defence-related computer software. Means should be developed of assuring that components do not end up as weapons in the wrong hands.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed-in-principle. See Recommendation 12 of the Majority Report. The question of regulating services is an important and complex new endeavour for the Commonwealth in the context of both defence and other industry sectors. As guidelines  for the control of services are developed they will be promulgated. While components are covered by the existing export controls, the Commonwealth recognises that in the international arms market place, there is a growing shift towards technology transfer and transfer of components rather than shipment of complete weapons systems. This trend may be expected to increase as production continues to globalize and companies operate in joint venture, teaming and other partnerships to compete in the decreasing market place. The trade in components, especially those produced for civilian applications , but useable in military systems, is a growing area which will be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 4.37</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implementation part of the process of regulation is the weakest area. We recommend that action should be taken to implement all the existing guidelines, especially those designed to guarantee human and civil rights, and those designed to minimise conflicts (internal and external) and to avoid aggravating international tensions, and that progress towards these goals be reported to the Parliament within six months. Extension of the guidelines to strengthen these considerations should also be investigated, and recommendations included with the progress report.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.38.i. Not agreed. Customs already has intelligence links with many other Customs agencies and with international police networks. The principal purpose of these links is to exchange information to assist in detecting breaches of Customs legislation. While Customs is confident that it would receive cooperation from other agencies in detecting breaches of legislation relating to defence exports where the other country maintains similar legislation, it doubts that it would receive assistance from countries which do not. Customs has greater doubts that it would receive any cooperation in monitoring legitimate trade in defence goods, even from countries with similar export controls, as there would be no legitimate reason to request information in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.38.ii. Not agreed. Australia's intelligence cooperation with other countries is a complex and sensitive matter. The Australian intelligence community works closely with intelligence organisations and government agencies of  friendly countries in monitoring arms transfers of potential significance to Australia, but the sensitivity of intelligence sources means that much of this information cannot be made public. However, it should be noted that very comprehensive information on arms transfers is available from public sources, in particular the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and Jane's Information Group. The UN Register of Conventional Arms is a database maintained by the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs in New York. It is based solely on information voluntarily provided by states on their own defence imports and exports. The UN does not seek the cooperation of national intelligence agencies to monitor the arms trade, and indeed such cooperation might be seen to compromise the neutrality of the Register and thereby reduce its effectiveness as a confidence-building measure.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now past time to assess those policies of non-market support for domestic defence enterprises, and we recommend that the policy of "defence self sufficiency" be included as one of the aspects of defence exports listed with the Auditor General for assessment.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not agreed. Government support for selected indigenous defence industry capabilities is a key element of Australia's defence policy. Export activity, over time, may reduce the need for Government support for such industry, however, the requirement for these specific indigenous capabilities is quite discrete from any export consideration. There is no Government policy espousing defence `self-sufficiency'.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 5.17<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A collateral conclusion is that the Government's active involvement, both as owner of defence enterprises, and as a facilitate of exports, appears to run counter to its regulatory role, and leads to a situation where the Government is producer, salesman, government export program provider, involved in Government-to-Government and military-to-military diplomacy, and is regulator. The Minister for Defence, as was noted, has ultimate discretion on regulation, and  is also responsible to actively promote export, particularly from companies where Government is commercially involved. There are a number of contradictory elements here, both ethically and commercially. It appears necessary to clearly separate the various functions of Government, and set up a situation where the Minister is directly involved only as a last resort, and not as a proactive agent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not agreed. The Government has actively sought to dispose of Defence-owned enterprises since the mid-80s and continues to divest itself of  those enterprises where appropriate. As well, the Government expects Australian firms to take the lead in marketing and exporting defence products. The Government supports and encourages the export of defence products from Australia only within carefully enforced guidelines which are consistent with our national interests and objectives. Companies will base their commercial activities in the defence sector on commercial viability. They would cease to do business in the sector if it were no longer profitable. There is no conflict of interest for the Minister. Only through Australia's commitment to the highest standards of export controls and regulation are we seen as a reliable and trustworthy recipient of foreign defence technology and weapon systems. It makes sense, therefore, for responsibility for defence materiel cooperation (whether acquisition, R&amp;D, technology transfer or exports) to be consolidated in one Department under the Minister for Defence.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this situation the only sensible path appears to be the wind-down of expenditures designed to develop export capability.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. The AEC has already decided in principle to implement this proposal and will raise it with the Australian Joint Roll Council (AJRC)(see Recommendation 43).

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. The Government notes that the Committee found that the electoral rolls were generally of a high standard. With respect to the errors referred to by the Committee, the AEC has already implemented a number of changes including the establishment of a client services unit within the Central Office enrolment section, and is appointing account managers for particular States.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not supported. In the light of Council of Australian Governments (COAG) decisions with respect to Ministerial Councils, it would seem inappropriate to adopt this recommendation at this time. The desired level of interaction between Commonwealth and State interests should be fully met by the Australian Joint Roll Council (Recommendation 43), the Joint Management Committees (Recommendation 40) plus the existing Senior Commonwealth and State Electoral Officials' Conference and the ongoing contact between the AEC and the State/Territory Commissions.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not supported. Evidence was received by the Committee in support of the separation, for reasons of political and practical reality, of the electoral functions of the Commonwealth and each State/Territory. In concluding that it should not recommend a single body to conduct all federal and State elections, the Committee appears to have accepted the weight of this evidence. The Government does not consider that it would be appropriate to appoint a State Commissioner to the Commonwealth Commission and thereby give the States an influence over Commonwealth matters including the conduct of Commonwealth elections. Such an appointment would also have the potential for conflict of interests&mdash;eg. in the area of the AEC's charging policy.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON ELECTORAL MATTERS  ENTITLED "READY OR NOT: REFINING THE PROCESS FOR ELECTION 93"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 17 December 1992 the then Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, Mr A Bevis MP, tabled the Report entitled "Ready or Not: Refining the Process for Election `93". The Report was the result of the Committee's Inquiry into the Conduct of the 1990 Federal Election, Part II and Preparations for the Next Federal Election. As amendments to legislation permitting the implementation of procedures for the counting of House of Representatives votes on polling night were then before the Senate, the Committee released an Interim Report on 24 November 1992 entitled "Counting the Vote on Election Night", which dealt only with counting and transmitting the vote on election night. As the recommendations of the Interim Report are reproduced in the main Report of the Committee this Response treats both Reports as one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Government respond to the Report on the 1990 Federal Election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government tabled its response to the Report on the 1990 Federal Election on 8 December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the AEC instruct DROs and Polling Officials to arrange any queues which may form on polling day, so that as many voters as possible are provided with shelter, with particular consideration for those with special needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. The problem of queuing at polling places was the subject of a detailed study within the Australian Electoral Commission, which resulted in revised policies on polling place resources and procedures being developed. The Divisional Office Procedures Elections Manual carries an instruction that queues should wherever possible be formed within the polling place to provide voters with protection from the elements. The Polling Place Control Manual issued to all Officers in Charge (OICs) of polling places carries a specific instruction to maintain queues within polling places, as does the Polling Place Procedures Manual issued to all polling staff. The training video shown to polling place OICs also carries that message. The experience of the 1993 elections was that the Commission's revised polling place policies have generally been successful. Further refinements are now being targeted to individual polling places to address specific local problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the AEC adjust its polling premises policy in order to minimise the use of dual polling places, and following the 1993 election, report to the JSCEM on the number of dual polling places used and any problems which may arise at such polling places.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dual polling places are created close to Divisional boundaries with convenience to the voter as the main consideration. They enable voters to cast an ordinary vote as opposed to the completion of a declaration vote at a convenient polling place, and help reduce confusion arising from electoral boundary changes. Accordingly, this part of the recommendation is not supported. The Australian Electoral Commission's National Polling Place Resources Policy includes in the criteria for the appointment of a dual polling place that such a polling place must take at least 240 declaration votes for an adjoining Division. This is the point past which a dual polling place becomes most effective and economically viable. For the 1993 election there were 125 premises housing shared polling places. The Commission included a report on the operation of dual polling places in its submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to assist its Inquiry into the Conduct of the 1993 Federal Election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Minister for Administrative Services seek an opinion from the Attorney-General on the application of s.44(iv) of the Constitution to employees of government enterprises who are not employed under the Public Service Act 1922.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. Advice has been received from the Attorney-General's Department. A copy of that advice has been referred to the Department of Industrial Relations. Over the past decade, the thrust of public sector reforms affecting government business enterprises and statutory authorities has been to devolve responsibility for day-to-day operational matters to the management of those organisations. Accordingly, those organisations are free to manage their industrial relations without reference to the Department of Industrial Relations for endorsement, other than in a limited number of matters. In keeping with this policy, advice will be provided to government business enterprises and non-Public Service Act authorities regarding the legal issues associated with employees and other office holders seeking election to Parliament; and the approach adopted in respect of Public Service Act employees standing for election to Parliament. Consistent with the emphasis of the abovementioned reforms, that advice will also encourage government business enterprises and non-Public Service Act authorities to develop, if they have not already done so, a policy on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the proposed approach to the States Attorneys-General regarding uniform re-employment provisions for public servants resigning to contest federal elections, be made as a matter of urgency, and that the AEC make the responses available to intending candidates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. At its meeting on 24 June 1993 the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG) considered some model provisions for public servant reinstatement rights, on which both federal, State and Territory jurisdictions could draw. SCAG recommended that Ministers endorse the model, and referred the provision to the appropriate State and Territory Ministers with a recommendation that it be enacted, while recognising that it is a matter for each jurisdiction to decide what approach they adopt. The matter is currently in the hands of the State and Territory Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the AEC review its Candidates' Handbook and Nomination Checklist to include information on the implications of the recent High Court decision and the possible need to take steps to establish their eligibility under s.44 of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. Supported. This recommendation was based on the Handbook and Nomination Form provided to intending candidates at the 1990 election and the voided 1992 Wills by-election. Both the Candidate's Handbook and the Nomination Form were revised prior to the 1993 election to provide material on the implications of the High Court's decision in the Sykes v Cleary case. A Nomination Checklist and the wording of section 44 of the Constitution were both included on the Nomination Form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 7</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that information about the proposed provisions on evidence of authorship or authorisation of material, if enacted by the Parliament, be included in the Candidates' Handbook.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. Material on evidence of authorship was included in the Candidate's Handbook prior to the 1993 election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 8</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the AEC conduct an evaluation of its enrolment program in remote areas and provide a report on the evaluation to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. The Australian Electoral Commission will begin this review in early 1994, following the completion of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Regional Council elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 9</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the AEC review the procedures required for finalising the Senate count, with a view to having the writs returned at the earliest opportunity following the election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. At the 1993 federal election, the AEC trialled the use of a computer program designed to speed the calculation of transfer values and other arithmetic processes necessary in a Senate scrutiny. While the trial identified that time was saved by using the program, the most time consuming tasks, involving the conduct of the formality check of the ballot papers and the need to physically allocate papers to candidates at each count, remained unaltered. For the 1993 election, the number of counts necessary and the period from polling day to the return of the Senate writ varied from 1 count in the ACT and the Northern Territory to 253 counts in New South Wales, and from 24 days in Tasmania to 46 days in South Australia, respectively. This compared with a high of 197 counts and 51 days for New South Wales at the 1990 election. Factors such as the number of candidates, size of the ballot paper, total number of ballot papers and a number of `non-ticket' ballot papers impact on the time required to conduct the scrutiny. In an attempt to further improve the speed of the Senate count, the Commission is developing an automated Senate scrutiny system. Early evaluation trials with proportional representation ballots indicate that the speed of the Senate scrutiny could be vastly improved while maintaining a comprehensive audit trail. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that an amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 will be required to allow such a system to be used. The Commission has recently lodged a submission with the JSC suggesting that the Committee may wish to consider recommending such an amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 10</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that divisional maps produced by the AEC name all streets and roads within the Division.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of these maps is to delineate clearly and precisely all Divisional boundaries. The maps are produced by the various State/Territory mapping authorities. They are very costly and the detail and presentation varies in accordance with the data held by the respective mapping authorities. It is assumed that this recommendation refers to metropolitan divisions primarily. The Australian Electoral Commission is investigating the practicality and cost of meeting this recommendation in those cases where all the metropolitan streets are not already named.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 11</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the AEC identify the two candidates to whom preferences are to be provisionally distributed on election night using all relevant objective data including historical results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. This was implemented for the 1993 election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 12</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the names of the two candidates identified for receipt of provisionally distributed preferences be kept confidential until the close of poll. Each DRO should be informed in confidence so that the relevant checks can be made before polling day. An exception can be made for those individuals employed by the media to program their election night computer systems, in which case the names of the candidates can be divulged in strict confidence and on a need-to-know basis no earlier than the morning of the election. The names of the two candidates should be given to the OIC of each polling place in a secure manner in a sealed envelope. The envelope should be opened in the presence of scrutineers and polling staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. This was implemented for the 1993 election. However, the Australian Electoral Commission believes that it would be preferable for polling place OICs to have access to this information, on a confidential basis, before polling day so that they are not placed under undue pressure at a critical time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 13</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At all stages of the count full and reasonable access should be provided for scrutineers and all polling staff should be informed of the scrutineers' rights of access. The access should ensure adequate scrutiny of the formality of the votes in the count of first preferences, opportunities to observe the preferences of minor candidates during the two-candidate preferred distribution, and opportunities to analyse all ballot papers as required after the results of the House of Representatives count have been transmitted. Access to the Senate count on election night should be adequate to monitor the formality of votes, with more comprehensive access to Senate ballot papers being afforded to scrutineers in subsequent counting of the vote. The AEC should consult the political parties and candidates regarding access for scrutineers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. This was implemented for the 1993 election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 14</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 15</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result of the provisional two-candidate preferred distribution should be transmitted as soon as possible from each polling place, and transmitted in at least three batches from the Divisional Office to the National Tally Room with information about the polling places included when approximately 10 per cent, approximately 40 per cent and the final count for the night is collected by the DRO.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Egypt and Israel, and the 93rd Inter-Parliamentary Conference which was held in Madrid between 26 March and 1 April 1995. I have much pleasure in making a few comments on this particular delegation. As the minister would know, we usually get on very well on a bipartisan basis on these particular occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that this delegation was led by the Speaker, the Hon. Steve Martin. The delegation of members from both chambers of the Australian parliament visited Egypt and Israel at the invitation of those respective parliaments and we attended the 93rd Inter-Parliamentary Conference held in Madrid. As an added bonus, we were very fortunate to have a stopover in Rome and the delegation was received by his Holiness the Pope at a Papal audience on Saturday, 11 March. He made comment about what a wonderful place Australia was. The Speaker pointed to the fact that when the Pope was in Australia it started to rain and that perhaps he might have to think about stopping at a few places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we visited the Middle East it was potentially unstable. It still is, of course. There are certain moves towards peace in the region, particularly since the signing of the declaration of principles by Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. The members of the delegation were the Hon. Steve Martin, who was leading the delegation, me, the Hon. Leo McLeay, Clyde Holding, who was a member at the 93rd Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference, as was Senator Cheryl Kernot, who joined us there, and Mr Rod Sawford MP and Mr Alex Somlyay, who were part of the delegation that visited Israel and Egypt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were accompanied by Anne Hazelton, who was secretary to the delegation. On her return she received a very honourable move to the Parliamentary Relations Office. We are very pleased to see that. Bill O'Brien, who was Counsellor from the Holy See, His Excellency Mr Colin McDonald in Cairo, His Excellency Mr Peter Rodgers in Tel Aviv and Mr Warwick Pearson in Madrid were very good in their organisation for when we visited there. Those posts were also excellent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bilateral visit to Egypt was of great importance. As honourable senators would know, Egypt is playing a key role in the peace process in the Middle East. It was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979 and it is playing a leading role. Egypt is an important trading customer for Australia. Most of our trade is wheat. Senator Panizza is not here, but Senator Crane is and he would know how important Egypt is as far as our wheat trade is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Speaker of the Egyptian parliament, Dr Fathi Sorour, is also the President of the Interparliamentary Council and was elected so at the previous Inter-Parliamentary Union. There was a lot of discussion about the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the non-signing of it by Israel. We put forward the Australian position in relation to the NPT. It is interesting to note that that matter is being debated here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the opportunity to see some of the new industrial cities being developed by Egypt and we visited Ramadan City, which has something like 2,000 industrial businesses of varying size. As far as the Egyptian visit was concerned, it was one characterised by great warmth and hospitality. I was amazed. It was the first time I had been to Egypt. Cairo itself is a very thriving city to say the least. The warmth and hospitality from the parliament right through to the people who drove us was most impressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We moved on to Israel. We had some very interesting discussions in Israel. The most interesting and impressive discussion was in our meeting with the President of Israel, Mr Ezer Weizmann. We had a three-quarter of an hour discussion with him. We had discussions with the Speaker of the Knesset, Professor Shevach Weiss. We were also honoured to have some discussions with the Deputy President and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Shimon Peres, along with some very important briefings from the Department for the Peace Process and Middle Eastern Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we were there we raised the subject of Australia's involvement in the multinational force and observers program on the border between Egypt and Israel. The foreign minister took on board that the success of that particular operation was something he would keep in mind if and when the peace arrangements could be made with Syria. While we were there we took the opportunity to visit the Golan Heights. I can assure the Senate that I can understand Israel's point of view of wanting to control the Golan Heights. On the other hand, since my return, it has been interesting to see that they may be willing to return the Golan Heights to Syria in their quest for peace. It is quite obvious, to us anyway, that the peace process, regardless of how slow it is moving and the immense difficulties that there are, is irreversible, even though it might be a highly complicated and complex one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had some very interesting discussions with the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce. It was interesting to note that they were particularly interested in processed food. The Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) probably has the same impression. I think he visited Israel a couple of weeks after we were there. They know that processed foods from Australia are basically disease free and chemical free. I pricked up my ears to that when I started talking to them about Tasmanian salmon, which is, at the present time anyway, disease free and certainly chemical free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One person we met at the chamber of commerce told us that the best building products in the world he imported were from England and Australia. On returning to Tasmania I made some inquiries of a local brickmaking concern. They were investigating exporting bricks to Israel. Interestingly enough, I think the freighting costs to freight a container load of bricks from Hobart to Melbourne was $1,300 and from Melbourne to Israel was $1,500. The Israelis were also very interested in our telecommunications and our scientific, medical and surgical markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were very impressed with Israel's attitude towards Jordan. A peace treaty was signed between them in 1994 and we were assured by everybody we spoke to that very good relations now exist with Jordan. We were also interested to hear from Mr Shimon Peres about his idea of involving joint ventures on the  border between the two countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We visited the multinational force in the Sinai where we have a contingent of 27 personnel. We were most impressed with the work carried out by Major General David Ferguson, who is the head of our force there. We are very proud of the fact that he is controlling some 2,000 combined troops from all around the world&mdash;Fiji, Colombia, France, Holland, the United States and Canada.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We visited Gaza.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right. The same sort of story, I guess. Australia has contributed $14 million in aid to Gaza. The overwhelming impression we gained was that the administration is tackling an enormous task. Infrastructure is almost non-existent. The uncontrolled disposal of waste water into the sea leading to degradation is a problem and waste water is also disposed of in the streets of Gaza&mdash;we drove through it! I thought they were short of water and made a comment to that effect. We found out afterwards it was raw sewage. Solid waste collection is almost non-existent. It is parked out in the streets where they just burn it. So you get not only water pollution but also air pollution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also visited the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation. They have strategic plans in hand for fixing all these problems. Obviously, finance will be the major problem. I believe that some of the money that Australia contributed was used in implementing these plans. They have strategic plans on where they believe they are going to get their income and we just hope that it works. But they have a huge task in front of them and anything that Australia can do further down the track to help them will be much appreciated. Some of the things we thought about in options for further Australian project activity include: cloud seeding, water conservation, and dryland agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we arrived in Madrid and participated in the 93rd International Parliamentary Union. Without going into all the details of that conference, for the second conference in a row our supplementary item was accepted and debated. We had the total support of the Asia-Pacific group in putting that forward. We ended up having a few arguments with the Belgians because our supplementary item took precedence over theirs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak tonight on the National Media Liaison Service. I am delighted that Senator McMullan is in the chamber. The estimates committee has now had two hearings on the National Media Liaison Service which, as Senator McMullan knows, absorbs $1.5 million per annum of the taxpayers' money and whose ostensive reason for being is to provide accurate and timely information on government programs.

By advancing this argument, he is attempting to avoid questioning about his particular role. In other words, when he appears in the press gallery, he says he does so as a member of the Ministerial Media Group and not as the director of the National Media Liaison Service and, therefore, cannot be subject to detailed questioning. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Epstein has made it clear that his contract of employment says that he is director of the Ministerial Media Group,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is what you said, Senator McMullan&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and I have no reason to doubt that that is accurate.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder whether Senator McMullan had a chance to actually view the contract of employment or whether he accepted on face value the comment of Mr Epstein. On 30 May, explaining Epstein's signing a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> as director of the Ministerial Media Group and the National Media Liaison Service, Senator McMullan told estimates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we were describing to you is the correct description of Mr Epstein's employment.&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and these are the key words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His contract makes it very clear that he is employed as director of the Ministerial Media Group and such responsibilities as he has for day-to-day supervision of NMLS under the delegation from the minister, which has been referred to from time to time, do not make any difference to the fact that his contractual status is&mdash;and the letter and the contract make it clear&mdash;solely as director of the Ministerial Media Group. It does not matter how many letters people write, they cannot change that fact.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, Senator McMullan made the contract of employment clear. Pressed on why Mr Epstein signed a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> with a title he did not have, Senator McMullan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">David can answer that better than me. My understanding is that it was a shorthand way of trying to explain to someone who seemed to be incapable of understanding the facts that were being put to them. But it does not in any way change the contractual status, which is as we explained before. He is the Director of the Ministerial Media Group.</PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on, Senator McMullan putting his name and reputation on the line, arguing that the contract of employment makes it very clear just what the position of Mr Epstein was or is. Senator McMullan will recall that on 30 May we had this debate once again. I asked whether the committee could be provided with a copy of Mr Epstein's contract. This was the exchange. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wonder if the committee could be provided with a copy of Mr Epstein's contract.</PARA>
<PARA>It should be remembered that we were relying on the contract of Mr Epstein to determine what his title was. Mr Epstein replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that question was asked last time and the relevant details were provided.</PARA>
<PARA>I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would just like the contract if we could, Mr Epstein. Could the Department. . .</PARA>
<PARA>So what we asked for was the contract which apparently Mr Epstein and Senator McMullan were relying on to determine the actual status and title of Mr Epstein. Well, the contract was tabled. This is the definitive document that Senator McMullan and Mr Epstein relied on to prove once and for all what his title was. Mr President, this is the contract&mdash;no mention of any title, no mention of the title of Mr David Epstein, not a mention of it. So I put it to you that Senator McMullan, either consciously or not, has been seriously guilty of misleading a Senate committee. Senator McMullan, on four to five occasions, urged the committee to rely on the contract which would prove the validity of the case that Mr Epstein was and solely is the Director of the Ministerial Media Group. It is no wonder that Senator McMullan is leaving the chamber, highly embarrassed as he is, and no answer can be provided. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you that a fair reading of the evidence that was given to the Senate committee, a fair reading of the contract of employment which we asked to be tabled by the Senate estimates committee, shows that Senator McMullan and Mr Epstein have been seriously misleading a Senate committee. A minister who misleads a Senate committee wilfully&mdash;and it did not only happen once, it happened on a number of occasions&mdash;has in the past been prepared to offer his resignation to the Senate. I believe that unless an explanation is given as to why Senator McMullan constantly, over two hearings, misled a Senate committee, he should resign his high office.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the last sitting week I tabled two photographs of marlin being unloaded from a longline tuna fishing boat in Cairns operated by a Mr Mike Rowley. These fish, I am informed by Mr Rowley's former manager, Mr David Armstrong, came from TEC 4, area E. This area was set aside from longline tuna fishing in 1980 to protect marlin stocks in the area from depletion. In 1986, at the first meeting of ECTUNAMAC, the East Coast Tuna Management Advisory Committee, three longline permits were issued upon strictly limited conditions, one being the return of all billfish to the water, whether dead or alive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the intervening period the number of permits on issue in the area has risen to 13. But Mr Rowley has now put a proposal before ECTUNAMAC which would effectively allow open slather longline fishing in TEC 4 area E. He seeks an increase in the number of hooks from the current 500 hooks to 1,500 hooks, an increase in the number of licences and a reduction in the size of the zone protected to half what it currently is. Mr Rowley is a member of ECTUNAMAC and so sits in judgment on his own proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the criticism that this would lead to unacceptable slaughter, Mr Rowley proposes a closure of the fishery to longliners for three months at the end of the year. Mr Rowley says this is the best protection which can be given to the marlin, but unfortunately the truth is somewhat different. For nine months of the year there will be no protection at all for the marlin, nor for the tuna on which they depend. An increased longline effort, and especially an increase in the number of hooks used by longline operators, can only lead to one consequence, and that is an increased bycatch of marlin in the other nine months of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to the photographs which I tabled. Mr Rowley claims these are not black or blue marlin, but striped marlin. He also claims that these fish were taken outside TEC 4 area E. Unfortunately, Mr Rowley's track record with the truth is so poor that nobody believes him. Tonight I intend to expose a litany of lies and half truths disseminated by Mr Rowley, as well as his motives for doing what he has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the photographs, I have had these examined by a number of experts, not one of whom believes they are of striped marlin. At best they say it is difficult to tell, and the reason for that is that Mr Rowley has his crews cut the heads off the fish. This not only helps hide the way in which the fish have been killed, but also hinders identification of the fish. I add that this practice is illegal in Queensland waters outside TEC 4 area E, as all billfish must retain their heads to allow easy identification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to Mr Rowley's claim that the fish did not come from the protected area, not only is this contrary to Mr Armstrong's advices but also it is contrary to what was contained in a letter written by Mr Rowley to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> on 10 June when he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . you may remember that I told you we had not fished in area E from September 1994 to May 1995. My vessels are now fishing in area E from time to time and will continue to do so . . .</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. At any rate, these photographs and Mr Rowley's admission that he has taken marlin give the lie to Mr Rowley's claim to ECTUNAMAC, which I referred to last week, wherein he stated that the industry was observing the ban on the taking of marlin almost 100 per cent. While that may be the case for other operators, it is clearly not the case for Mr Rowley, who considers himself above the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to some of the claims Mr Rowley has made in the media about what he is doing, and about himself. In a newspaper story that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> on 10 June 1995, Mr Rowley claimed that he is a third generation fisherman, that his family pioneered longline fishing in Australia and that he is only seeking to win back market share from the Japanese for the Australian industry. All of this is intended to give the impression that Mr Rowley is a struggling Aussie battler. Now let me get to the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Rowley may be a third generation fisherman, but he was not born in Australia. Returns to the Australian Securities Commission show that Mr Rowley was born in Middlesborough, England in June 1933. But that is nothing compared to his grossest untruth. Company searches were conducted last week on three companies with which Mr Rowley is or has been involved. They are Seafood Management Pty Ltd, Fortuna Seafoods Pty Ltd and Sandgate Sashimi Pty Ltd. I seek leave to table these documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Seafood Management is a vehicle of which Mr Rowley had been a director from shortly after incorporation in 1991 until late 1994. Mr Rowley's wife remains a director. This is also the company which sold some, if not all, of the marlin unloaded from Mr Rowley's boats. Many people believe this company is owned and controlled by Mr Rowley. However, the principal executive officer shown on the company's files at the ASC is Mr Jin Tyan Chen of Kaohsiung, Taiwan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the details of shareholders, one can see that there are 10 shares on issue, five of which are beneficially owned by Mr Jin Tyan Chen, four shares are owned by other Taiwanese and one share is owned by Mr Rowley. Mr Rowley does not have the beneficial interest in the share, though, and it is not known who does. Seafood Management is not an Australian owned company but a Taiwanese owned company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next company associated with Mr Rowley is Fortuna Seafoods Pty Ltd, which is shown in the records of the Queensland Department of Transport as being the owner of the vessels <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fortuna II</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sarah Jay</EMPHASIS>. This company has two shareholders, Mr Rowley and his wife, but the company is a trustee company for unnamed beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third company associated with Mr Rowley is Sandgate Sashimi Pty Ltd. This company is the owner of a vessel called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cygnet Bay</EMPHASIS>. This vessel is important because it is the holder of a non-active permit to fish in TEC 4 area E, as well as another entitlement to fish for tuna elsewhere on the east coast of Australia. This company's records show that the shareholders are Mr Richard Richmond and Mr Kenneth McEwen. However, both gentlemen have resigned as directors, and in their place are Mr Rowley and the same Taiwanese gentleman I referred to earlier, Mr Chen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Puzzled by this, I telephoned Mr McEwen last Friday night and was told that the shares in the company were sold earlier this year to a Taiwanese concern put together by Mr Rowley called Seafood Management Pty Ltd. Apparently the share transfer form has not yet been processed. The reason for this share trading is to permit a transfer of a permit to fish in TEC 4 area E into the hands of Taiwanese fishermen and to flout the law relating to permits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the act, permits are supposed to be non-transferable. Mr Rowley boasted at last Thursday's ECTUNAMAC meeting that this was easily circumvented. He said, `Unfortunately, in Australia, the rules do not mean what they say.' Mr Rowley went on to explain how he has been able to obtain permits by buying the shares in the companies that own boats with existing permits. This is exactly what he has done for the Taiwanese with Sandgate Sashimi Pty Ltd, and when Mr Rowley has succeeded in changing the conditions that apply to fishing in the protected area, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cygnet Bay</EMPHASIS> will be replaced by a larger Taiwanese vessel, possibly either the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fortuna I</EMPHASIS> or <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fortuna III</EMPHASIS>, both of which are owned by Mr Chen and currently outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia and the Australian government should know that Mr Rowley's interests are, at least in part, not Australian at all but are the interests of foreign fishermen who were successfully chased out of these waters 15 years ago. Mr Rowley is a deceitful bully who must surely be the closest thing to the Australian fishing industry's own shonky used car salesman. His proposal will only bring damage to an important protected fishery, and it must not be accepted in any way. That is why he is opposed by the Queensland Commercial Fishermen's Organisation. Mr Rowley should now also have the decency to resign from ECTUNAMAC. If he does not do so, he should be sacked from this position of trust which he has so flagrantly abused. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond to an answer that was given to me in the Senate on 5 June by the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Cook. On that day, I asked him whether he could explain to the Senate why the Australian dollar had fallen 25 per cent against the New Zealand dollar in the last three years, including 13 per cent in the last five months alone; why the unemployment percentage in New Zealand is some 30 per cent less than in Australia; why New Zealand is able to produce a budget surplus of 3.6 per cent of GDP without any resort to asset sales, whereas the best that the government here can do without asset sales is to produce a deficit in excess of $8 billion; and why the Australian government cannot produce surpluses large enough to fund tax cuts, increased welfare spending and a reduction of public debt as the New Zealand government does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his answer, Senator Cook gave a very critical commentary on what he saw to be the situation in New Zealand. The obvious strength and passion of feeling that Senator Cook had against New Zealand and New Zealand's policies was extremely denigrating and of great concern to any New Zealander listening to his answer. In terms of the New Zealand policies and the way that they have gone, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in my view it is not a route that any civilised government would want to take. It is too brutal and too socially divisive.</PARA>
<PARA>The latter words, `brutal' and `socially divisive', were used by the Treasurer, Mr Willis, a few days earlier and were echoed by Senator Cook. They were very critical comments. In effect, Senator Cook is saying that New Zealand is not a civilised government. I think it is a disgrace for any senior minister of the Australian government to level that against our Anzac colleague. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerned me even more than the vitriol that Senator Cook poured on New Zealand and its policies, which policies have had an extraordinarily beneficial effect on New Zealand as a whole and its prospects in the world&mdash;it is now an internationally competitive economy that leaves Australia way behind&mdash;is that, amongst other things, in his response to me Senator Cook said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . several thousand New Zealanders in Australia are benefiting from our social welfare and unemployment benefit. If they returned to New Zealand you would have an unemployment rate of around 20 per cent and not the current level.</PARA>
<PARA>The statement that unemployment in New Zealand would be 20 per cent, compared with the existing figure of about 6.6 per cent, if the unemployed New Zealanders in Australia went back to New Zealand and failed to get work there is a monstrously inaccurate statement. No wonder the New Zealand High Commission in Canberra picked up that statement&mdash;that gross and monstrous inaccuracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very understandably, the New Zealand High Commissioner, Mr Fortune, wrote to Senator Cook the following day, 6 June, to point out the inaccuracy of his statement. The High Commissioner in his letter said that, according to figures compiled by the Australian Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research, as of February this year there were 17,200 unemployed New Zealanders living in Australia. The High Commissioner went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A rough calculation shows that if these people returned to New Zealand the level of unemployment in New Zealand would rise from 6.6% to around 7.6%.</PARA>

There is no way in the world that even Senator Cook, with his penchant for poetic licence, can say that 20 per cent unemployment in New Zealand is roughly in the same range or the same ballpark&mdash;two of his favourite terms&mdash;as a 7.6 per cent unemployment rate. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1375" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. Under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 contributions are paid to personal superannuation schemes through the Commonwealth payroll system administered by the Department of Finance (DoF). A `group' cheque is issued each fortnight by DoF to the life office/superannuation fund on the basis of information supplied by the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) for the total amount of all the payees' superannuation contributions (employer and employee) that are administered by that life office/superannuation fund along with a printed statement listing payee details and contribution amounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Two days prior to the payday. Normally this is the Tuesday prior to the Thursday payday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) DAS does not keep records of the total annual contributions paid to deduction authorities back to 1988. A computer report for the amount of superannuation contributions made to AMP is available for 1993 and 1994. The amounts are as  follows: 1993&mdash;$1,311,892.77; 1994&mdash;$1,038,195.64.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) AMP appear to have experienced some administrative difficulties in reconciling the `group' cheque issued by DoF with details of contribution amounts set out in the accompanying printed statement. This has led to delays and some errors in the crediting of contributions and interest to at least one individual electorate staff account. The problem was not identified until AMP was queried by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) following a complaint by an electorate staffer. The ISC notified the Government after it commenced investigating the matter with AMP (see part 13 below).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) One electorate staff member has been identified as having experienced shortfalls in calculated superannuation payments by AMP. The relevant account has been rectified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) DAS has written to all staff employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 who are members of private superannuation schemes. It was suggested that they may wish to check their records for possible irregularities in their superannuation accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To supplement this, the ISC has written to all twenty life offices/superannuation funds which receive superannuation contributions through the Commonwealth payroll system by and on behalf of electorate staff, requesting that they perform a person by person&mdash;or where this is not practicable, a sample&mdash;manual reconciliation of the contributions of past and present electorate staff to ensure that their account balances are correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the ISC will follow up with funds which appear to have weaknesses in their systems to ensure that these systems are suitably upgraded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) AMP have undertaken to manually check (to the extent records are available) and, where necessary, correct the accounts of other electorate staffers who have or have had superannuation contributions paid to AMP by way of DoF `group' payroll deductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The group payment scheme for electorate staff with private superannuation arrangements has not been disallowed and the AMP product involved is still operating for existing members. However, since July 1990 new electorate staff have been required to join the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme and staffers in personal superannuation arrangements will therefore decline over time. AMP has indicated it may wish to offer existing members the option of transferring to another product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AMP have advised the ISC that the product concerned was not originally designed to be used in the way it now is for these Parliamentary staffers. In particular, it is a personal superannuation product which would normally receive contributions direct from the employee and/or employer, and not via a group payment mechanism. The product became more difficult to administer for Parliamentary staffers in 1988, when differential tax treatment of employee and employer contributions was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) See answers to part 8 above. AMP has not formally proposed an alternative scheme; the current scheme remains operational for existing members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) Under the `group' superannuation payment system for Ministerial and electorate staff, DAS passes information including each payee's name, superannuation policy number and amount of employer contribution, together with the total employer plus employee contribution, to DoF through a direct computer link. Under DoF's standing-amount-variation system, the same contribution amounts will be sent to AMP automatically each fortnight, unless and until DAS process a variation on notification from the electorate staff member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DoF processes the information as part of the Commonwealth payroll system and issues a group cheque to the relevant life office/superannuation fund through the regional office in the State in which the employee is domiciled. The cheque covers the total amount of all contributions (employer and employee) that are administered by that life office/superannuation fund (ie a `group cheque') and is accompanied by a printed statement which sets out a list of all the employees involved, a reference to the paying agency, the amount of the employer contribution, the gross amount of the contribution for each employee, the policy number and any variations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DoF and DAS are satisfied with the integrity of their systems and procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DoF has confirmed that fortnightly group superannuation cheques sent by its regional offices to life companies/superannuation funds are generally received and cashed on the due date. The money is then available to be allocated to each individual employee's account. Some life offices/superannuation funds initially place the cash into a `suspense' account, pending reconciliation of the moneys with the details; however, interest credited to individual accounts in these circumstances is backdated to date of receipt of the `group' cheque.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timing of superannuation payments by DoF to AMP is well within the maximum time frame allowable under section 64 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) (SIS) Act 1993. Section 64 provides that employers who deduct moneys from the salaries or wages of their employees for the purpose of making superannuation contributions must pay to the trustees of the relevant superannuation funds those amounts before the end of the 28 day period beginning immediately after the end of the month in which the deduction was made. An employer who intentionally or recklessly fails to observe this requirement is guilty of an offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) The SIS Act 1993 does not impose any direct legal responsibility on trustees to ensure that  employer contributions are paid to the fund by the appropriate date.  As mentioned in relation to question (10) above, the regulatory framework places responsibility for the prompt remittance of contributions on employers rather than trustees. This reflects the fact that it is the employer, not the trustee, that has funding responsibilities in respect of the scheme. However, this does not absolve the fund trustees from seeking to ensure that contributions received are properly identified and promptly processed; and member accounts are required to be correct and current at each balance date, or when a member leaves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) The Trade Practices Commission (TPC) made preliminary enquiries into the complaint by the specific electorate staff member who had problems with the AMP. When these enquiries established that the problems stemmed from administrative and accounting problems rather than misrepresentations, the TPC and ISC agreed it was more appropriate for the ISC to have carriage of the investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TPC participated in subsequent discussions and is being kept informed of progress in the ISC's investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) As mentioned in the answer to part (6), the ISC is investigating insurance companies and other superannuation providers that manage superannuation accounts on behalf of electorate staff. The ISC investigation is aimed at:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">resolving the specific problems relating to superannuation accounts with AMP;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">determining whether other life offices/superannuation funds administering accounts for electorate staff payment arrangements are affected by similar administrative problems, and if so, ensuring that any errors are rectified and systems upgraded as appropriate; and</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) contributions include employer and employee components, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) the accounts involve personal superannuation products chosen by the employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to its discussions with AMP, the ISC has written to 20 life offices/superannuation funds seeking information on Parliamentary staffer accounts and on their administrative systems generally. Where  funds have not responded to the ISC's satisfaction, it is following up. In addition, the ISC has conducted field visits to several life offices to look at their capacity to promptly and accurately allocate contributions to personal accounts when payments are made by way of group cheques.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On balance, the ISC considers there is no endemic problem in the industry with either group/corporate or personal arrangements in respect of the processing of bulk contributions. However, there are some companies whose administrative procedures could potentially cause isolated problems. The ISC will work with the industry to develop solutions, including `best practices' guidelines, to overcome these inadequacies.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Bob Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government considers that the EPA report gives a distorted view of noise exposure around the airport. The noise readings ignore any change in noise exposure due to daily or seasonal variations in wind patterns and aircraft movements, and are not representative of what will happen most of the time. Additionally, the EPA noise readings were conducted prior to the implementation of changes to aircraft operations announced by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport on 8 December 1994. These measures include the regulation of strict arrival and departure corridors, requiring all jets to depart from the southern threshold of the main runway when departing to the north, the application of steeper climb procedures and additional flexibility in downwind limits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, data released by the Civil Aviation Authority shows that the number of people seriously and moderately affected by aircraft noise since the new runway opened has been cut by around half.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EPA report is correct in warning of the noise problems that would be encountered if a return were made to regular operations on the east-west (cross) runway, and the Government welcomes the EPA's indication of the NSW Government's support for the current curfew arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. The noise readings in the NSW EPA report are consistent with predicted noise levels and Sydney Airport's Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF). The Draft Noise Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement on Sydney Airport involved substantial public consultative processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. It is the EPA's misinterpretation of the contours which has led to recent claims that some suburbs likely to be affected by noise were never identified before the runway opened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The published noise (ANEF) contours for Sydney Airport show areas where aircraft exposure is expected to reach certain levels. This does not mean that areas outside the contours are not exposed to aircraft noise, but that they experience lower levels of noise because of factors such as less frequent overflights and the height or type of aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The CAA presented information to the Senate on 15 February 1995 concerning noise testing that it has been carrying out since the third runway was opened. Noise levels in the vicinity of the airport are being constantly monitored, and information will be made available to the community through consultative mechanisms which have recently been established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) On 8 December 1994 the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport issued a detailed joint statement on the Government's noise management initiatives at Sydney Airport. In that statement, the Government announced that to improve monitoring, information and consultation with residents affected by aircraft noise, the Government would establish a new community consultative committee to monitor noise abatement and amelioration measures. The committee, which is now in place, will also provide residents in noise affected areas access to information about the Airport's operations. The committee, known as the Sydney Airport Community Consultative Committee, is chaired by the Chairman of Worksafe Australia, the Hon Joe Riordan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Information released through this Committee to the community will include, for example, details of actions taken on any breaches of the curfew or breaches of the Airport's flight corridors, and summaries of the results of noise and air quality monitoring.  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Terms of Reference of the Committee is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The statement issued by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport on 8 December 1994 following the public rally at Leichhardt Oval clearly explained the Government's noise amelioration package for affected residents, along with the Government's proposals to minimise the actual numbers of residents and suburbs affected. The statement also reaffirmed that operational noise controls at Sydney Airport would be strictly enforced, and reiterated that the east-west runway would remain available for use when weather conditions precluded take-offs and landings on the parallel runways for safety reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is concerned to ensure safe operations at the airport and that parallel runway operations are accepted internationally as providing an improvement in safety over intersecting operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA, in a public statement on 30 November 1994, reaffirmed its position that, on safety grounds, it strongly advises against the use of the east-west runway in intersecting operations with the parallel north-south runway system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA's position is based on the following considerations: it has been accepted internationally that parallel runway operations are an improvement in safety over intersecting operations; more complex three runway configuration operations would increase workload and complexity for air traffic controllers and pilots, with conflicting traffic patterns both on the ground and in the air; a large number of aircraft would need to cross the active east-west runway to position for take-off on the parallel runways, or taxiing to the terminals after landing (it is estimated that aircraft would be expected to cross the east-west runway every 45 seconds or less); and with the use of the intersecting east-west runway, the required safety corridors to accommodate aircraft carrying out missed approaches could not be readily provided.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. The Government's foreign investment policy limits the total (non-portfolio) foreign interest involvement in a mass circulation newspaper to a maximum of 30 per cent, with a single foreign investor (and associates) restricted to a shareholding of up to 25 per cent and unrelated (non-portfolio) shareholdings restricted to 5 per cent. Total foreign involvement may exceed 30 per cent if there are unrelated passive portfolio holdings in addition to the non-portfolio holdings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Government is not aware of any mass circulation newspaper in Australia in which the foreign (non-portfolio) investment since 20 April 1993 has exceeded or currently exceeds 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Under the notification provisions of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, all proposals to acquire a substantial interest (15 per cent or more) or to acquire any interest beyond 15 per cent in an Australian corporation with total gross assets of $5 million or more, require approval. In addition, under the Government's foreign investment policy as it applies to acquisitions in the media sector, all proposals by foreign interests to acquire an interest, irrespective of size, in a newspaper in Australia (except in relation to the Fairfax papers) are subject to a case-by-case examination. The maximum permitted non-portfolio foreign interest involvement in mass circulation newspapers by a single shareholder (and associates) is 25 per cent and unrelated foreign interests are allowed to have (non-portfolio) shareholdings of up to 5 per cent. In the case of newspapers other than the Fairfax group, portfolio holdings are normally interpreted as investment less than 15 per cent. In the case of the Fairfax Newspaper Group, foreign interests need not obtain prior approval to acquire portfolio shareholdings under 5 per cent, in cases where the foreign investor is neither related to any other Fairfax investor (including The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> and Hellman &amp; Friedman), nor represented on the Fairfax Board. For the Fairfax newspapers, portfolio shareholdings are normally those of less than 5 per cent (press release of 23 April 1992).</PARA>

In determining the level of funding for each individual program in these sectors, the Government takes into account a range of factors in addition to the actual cost, such as the level of demand for the service, the efficiency of the program in meeting its specified outcomes, and the potential for overlap with other State and Territory programs, as well as the appropriateness of the program and the level of funding in the context of the overall economic environment. Once the overall level of funding is decided, a variety of methods is used to index programs for changes in wage and other costs so as to enable outputs to be maintained in the face of rising costs over time. These arrangements can involve indexation by changes in earnings based measures or changes in broad based indexes such as the consumer price index, or some mixture of the two. Thus, to the extent that the impact of the introduction of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge (SGC) in 1992 was reflected in the indexation factors used at that time, supplementation for the SGC would have occurred through the indexation arrangements.</PARA>

The terms of reference provide an avenue for the impact of the SGC on CSWOs to be raised by CSWOs and assessed by the Industry Commission.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Housing and Regional Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The recently completed national evaluation of JPET found that JPET had been very successful in providing flexible services to assist young homeless people into open employment, achieving similar levels of success as other comparable labour market programs. However, the evaluation also identified a significant and increasing overlap with initiatives under Working Nation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The pilot phase of the JPET program will conclude on 30/6/95, after which it will be integrated with the arrangements under Working Nation to ensure that young homeless people have greater access to the range of new programs now available. However, clients of the JPET program who have not completed their JPET programs at 30/6/95 will be assisted to complete them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) When JPET commenced operation there were no similar programs offering case management for this group of young people. Since then, new initiatives have been introduced under the Working Nation arrangements, including case management which may be provided by public or private case managers. Wherever possible, young people choose whether their case manager is from the public sector agency, Employment Assistance Australia, or from private, community or other organisations accredited and contracted by the Employment Services Regulatory Authority (ESRA). A number of JPET services have been accredited and contracted by ESRA to provide case management services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The JPET evaluation included an extensive process of consultation with service coordinators, workers and clients. Their views and reactions have been considered in both the evaluation report and decisions regarding the program's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Yes, the Government is aware of the views of JPET workers regarding the future of the program and wherever  possible took those views into consideration in arriving at its decision. However, it needs to be stressed that this program is a pilot which has always been scheduled to conclude on 30 June 1995 and it is in the best interests of clients to gain access to the full range of labour market assistance through the Working Nation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Most of these elements were referred to in the evaluation as contributing to the success of JPET. It should be noted however that JPET services were expected to meet performance targets and often developed formal agreements with their clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) No. The Youth Training Initiative (YTI) was implemented as a new approach to assist young unemployed people to gain access to suitable education, training or work experience through the provision of increased levels of support. The new case management arrangements under Working Nation are designed to be flexible and meet the individual needs of clients. Many JPET clients are already in receipt of case management services under YTI arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) No. As noted above, the pilot phase of the JPET program will conclude on 30 June 1995 and the interests of clients in the longer term will best be served by the integration of JPET with the arrangements under Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Yes. Case management arrangements under Working Nation support the job seeker in his or her search for work, providing assistance on a one to one basis. To ensure that the considerable expertise that JPET services have developed in providing flexible, individual support to young homeless people is not lost, JPET services that have not already done so will be encouraged to apply for accreditation and funding through Working Nation initiatives.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five years was considered a reasonable estimate of the time required for the first iteration of the CAP because of the considerable unforecast resources consumed by the process, the capacity of the consultants to undertake the extensive study of ADF training, and the capacity of the ACT and other State accreditation agencies to review and approve awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As additional resources have been made available, and the consultants have found additional capacity, the accreditation process has been accelerated.

The cost of accrediting a single Naval category may be as much as $50 000 depending on the size of the category and extent of training undertaken by personnel in that category during their career.

If the accreditation agency agrees with the recommendation of the report, then the individual Service or ADF college (registered as a training provider) is authorised to award personnel with the recommended award. The whole process can take up to 12 months to complete.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) (a) Civil accreditation of ADF training was introduced as a recruiting tool, and to provide maximum post-Service employment opportunities to members. From a morale viewpoint, ADF personnel generally see the accreditation process in a positive light. Acknowledgment that their training has been recognised outside the ADF improves their self worth. In general, the level of award increases with promotion and training. Consequently it is a factor in encouraging Service personnel to continue their career in the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) (b) Retention of ADF personnel is a complex issue. One perception is that if the ADF provides a member with a civilian qualification, that member will use that qualification to gain civilian employment. On the other hand if a member sees that he or she can gain a civilian qualification, and enhance previous qualifications, within the ADF, then he or she will remain. It is felt that wastage rates will always rise and fall in line with the economy, and if anything, civilian accreditation will retain members.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) CSIRO is constructing an interpretive display on tropical rainforests in a building provided by Skyrail Ltd, the operators of a cable-car between Cairns and Kuranda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) CSIRO will provide interactive displays for the interpretive centre at a cost of $150,000 and in-kind expertise to the value of $70,000.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As the centre is based at one of the stations of the Skyrail cable-way only people travelling on Skyrail, including general public, will have access to the interpretive centre in its entirety.
