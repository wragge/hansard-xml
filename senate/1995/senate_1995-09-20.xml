<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main amendments in this bill will change the existing unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The handling of cases will become simpler, more effective and less legalistic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These proposals reflect the outcome of discussions with employer representatives, the ACTU and state governments. The amendments have been widely welcomed by leading business groups, including the ACCI and the MTIA, and have the support of the union movement as part of the latest accord between the government and the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes will make a good system even better.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also make minor amendments to other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfair Dismissal Provisions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of fundamental minimum entitlements for Australian employees were introduced into the Industrial Relations Act by the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key initiative was to ensure that employees are guaranteed a fair level of employment protection. This gives effect to the internationally recognised standards contained in the ILO's Termination of Employment Convention. This step was necessary to address the removal or restriction of protection under the industrial relations agendas of conservative state governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Industrial Relations Act now ensures that employees have a remedy if they are unfairly dismissed. The legislation was not intended to supplant other fair remedies under state laws which met the international standard. Instead it meant that an employee whose protection was inadequate, or who had no remedy at all, could use the federal system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation has been operating for over 17 months. It has been used by employees to differing degrees in all states and territories. It is the only relevant remedy for dismissed employees in Victoria, which removed any fair protection under the much criticised 1992 Kennett industrial legislation. It is worth noting that 45% of all applications filed under the federal system have been from Victoria. There has also been increasing recourse to the federal system by dismissed employees in New South Wales, which does not cover all employees under its industrial legislation, and in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been a new field for federal legislation, which previously only provided remedies where dismissals were discriminatory, leaving the general area of unfair dismissals to state laws. Clearly, by enacting the legislation, the Commonwealth has filled in gaps in employment protection: gaps which had previously existed or which were created by regressive state legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has carefully monitored the operation of the legislation, including by consultation with the National Labour Consultative Council and state industrial relations ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the consultative process, we now propose four changes to the existing provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, all applications will commence in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Applications now begin in the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, which refers most of them to the commission for conciliation. This first procedural step can be streamlined, with greater emphasis on trying to resolve cases by conciliation first. The court will only become involved if conciliation fails and the parties do not wish to have the matter resolved by voluntary arbitration. The government expects that the great majority of cases will continue to be resolved by negotiation and conciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ninety-four percent of all cases have been settled through conciliation or mediation, or have been discontinued after negotiation. Two-thirds of these were settled after the commission conciliated. Only six percent of cases have been determined by the court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the act will allow consent arbitration of unfair dismissal claims, when the parties choose this option. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will conduct the arbitration. The commission's decision will be binding and enforceable by the court. Parties will therefore be able to avoid the need for a hearing in the court, by choosing a less legalistic way of resolving the claim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third amendment will clarify when state law provides an acceptable alternative to the federal remedy. The government has always intended that dismissed employees use state remedies, rather than the federal provisions, when the state remedies provide satisfactory protection against unfair dismissals. The existing test of what is an acceptable alternative remedy has two elements. The remedy must be provided under machinery which gives effect to the ILO convention, and the remedy must also be one which the court decides is adequate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This aspect of the legislation has operated more strictly than anticipated, so that only state laws which virtually replicate the federal legislation could be treated as adequate alternative remedies. Most states have indicated that they are willing to provide protection against unfair dismissal which will meet the requirements of the ILO convention but which may involve a different approach from that taken under the federal laws. This has been accepted by the members of the NLCC as an acceptable approach. Accordingly, under these amendments, if the court is satisfied that an alternative remedy meets the relevant requirements of the ILO convention, no remedy will be available under the unlawful termination provisions of the Industrial Relations Act. It is of course implicit in this new provision that the state law must genuinely conform to the ILO convention if it is to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of that convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the amendment, a state will be able to give effect to the convention in its own way. Provision will also be made to give greater certainty to a state as to what will be taken to be an adequate alternative remedy. This is in response to requests by some states for such a provision. Accordingly, a state law will be taken to be an adequate alternative remedy where it requires the relevant state tribunal to give effect to the convention and gives it the necessary powers to do so. This does not prevent a state from choosing another suitable approach to meeting the requirements of the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whichever approach is taken in the state law, it must also provide for the making of late applications by dismissed employees who mistakenly applied for a remedy in the federal system rather than under the relevant state law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fourth change is of particular importance. The act will be amended to make it clear that a breach of an employer's obligations will not automatically lead to a remedy. It has been suggested that remedies are given for breaches based only on procedural grounds without regard to the overall circumstances. Such a situation should not exist. For example, there should not be any guarantee of a remedy where the only defect in the employer's conduct has been some failure to provide procedural fairness and the employee's conduct warrants dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To make it clear that this situation is not intended, the court will be required to consider all the circumstances in deciding whether a remedy of reinstatement or compensation should be granted and, if so, what the remedy should be. In other words, the court will weigh up all of the circumstances, and may, even though an employer has not met a statutory requirement, decide that a remedy should not be given to the employee. This approach is consistent with the long standing practice of industrial tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Legislation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes two amendments of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. The first will clarify that no employee injured prior to the commencement of that act is entitled to have his or her compensation entitlements indexed after the age of 65.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second amendment will clarify that injuries sustained in the course of travel to or from work are not compensable if they occur wholly within the boundary of the property on which the employee's residence is located.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also provide a mechanism for ensuring that determinations of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal are free of sex discrimination. This mechanism has already been provided in relation to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the remuneration tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stevedoring legislation will be amended by this bill to reflect current usage; `waterside workers' are now better described as `stevedoring employees'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are also minor technical amendments about industrial relations jurisdiction in coal industry matters.All these amendments are explained in more detail in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has consulted employer groups and the ACTU about the best way to ensure that the new arrangements operate efficiently, effectively and quickly for all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission is proposing innovative methods to ensure the speedy listing and determination of applications under the amended provisions. To support this, the commission is constructing some new hearing rooms and support facilities for the parties and their representatives, in Sydney and Melbourne, at an estimated one-off cost of $1 million. There will also be some additional staff required to advise and assist applicants and other parties. The cost of the additional staff over a full year is estimated to be $0.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A reduction in the resources required by the court is expected. However it is not possible to estimate with any certainty what that reduction will be before the new arrangements are better established and the court has dealt with the balance of its caseload under the existing legislative arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say, in terms of the tack you are taking, Senator Coulter, I understand your concern and your fellow feeling with galahs and the problems they might cause in North America. But it is a fact, regrettable though it might be, that the total number of birds that are exported in this category&mdash;that is, as pets&mdash;is very small. It is perhaps several hundred a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Australian authorities, quarantine and customs&mdash;I have to say with some success&mdash;routinely and regularly intervene with the illegal trade, unfortunately, because of the extremely high value of Australian birds overseas, it is a very lucrative trade. There is no question that the smuggling problem is a far greater hazard to countries overseas from the illegal trade than from the legal trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I was not making any such ludicrous suggestion as Senator Coulter is putting. I simply think that Senator Coulter is getting the quantum, the size, of the problem out of proportion. In any case, most people want to take only one or two birds as pets. The countries to which they are being imported&mdash;and I think it is a fairly imperialistic stance you are taking, Senator Coulter, in that regard&mdash;actually do have authorities and quarantine requirements of their own that are exercised. AQIS, the Australian quarantine authority, is in active liaison in a very pro-active way with quarantine authorities around the world in those countries. It is not a simple one-way street, Senator Coulter, that you are putting to me that I am suggesting at all. There is active liaison constantly between the Australian quarantine authorities and overseas countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add, to the great credit of AQIS, that AQIS has been in a position and is currently in a position of providing expert technical assistance to a great many countries in terms of their quarantine environment. That is something we continue to do on a daily basis. We do not believe that the problem is as great as Senator Coulter is suggesting.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) has referred to is one of the reasons why the Greens (WA) suggested that this clause should be opposed. If I can just remind my colleagues and the minister, the question that was being asked when I opposed this item related to a change which has been requested in this bill. Previously, people who wanted to take a pet out of the country were required to prove they had had that as a pet for three years. Now they do not have to prove that they have had it as a pet for three years. They may have had it as a pet for half an hour, a week or whatever. In fact, it is irrelevant. That requirement is being removed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern being raised was that this could represent a loophole by which numbers of native Australian animals could be taken from the country and it could provide a loophole for smuggling and illicit trade in our native animals&mdash;the concern that Senator Collins expressed. I think the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) made light of that and said that it was extremely unlikely that it could be used as a loophole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At one level, I would be prepared to accept advice&mdash;in fact, that is why I asked the question&mdash;that it will not constitute a loophole, that it is simply a way of easing some of the bureaucratic nightmares that ordinary householders might have of taking their pets with them when they are going out of the country permanently. My concern is that, by not having any kind of duration attached to that status, people who are leaving the country permanently could be used as an avenue for getting large numbers of birds out two by two, so to speak&mdash;a kind of Noah's ark&mdash;which would allow illicit trade. As Senator Collins mentioned, the species that are listed&mdash;the sulphur-crested cockatoo, the galah, the corella, the cockatiel and the budgerigar&mdash;are very prized overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am prepared to admit that it may not be the loophole that we were concerned about, but I do not think the argument has been addressed; neither has the case been defended for why the three years is such a burdensome requirement. In my view it also covers the point that Senator Coulter raised that somebody can just say that what they have immediately in their hand&mdash;a bird in the hand, so to speak&mdash;is a pet and we do not know where that bird has been prior to that. There may be other concerns that have been raised by taking it so quickly through quarantine. I think the minister has addressed that by saying that we have to trust our quarantine process and also the legal requirements of other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to push it but I think I can continue to say we have the numbers&mdash;I am not sure because Senator Kemp has not spoken&mdash;to defeat this item. Proof of owning an animal is being reduced from `the exporter has owned and kept the animal as a household pet for not less than 3 years immediately preceding the export' to `the exporter kept the animal as a household pet immediately before the export'. I repeat to the minister that the reason for that change I do not believe has been argued thoroughly so as to remove the possibility of a loophole existing. </PARA>

I think at the start of this debate I did canvass that I had a number of matters I wished to raise. But from the point of courtesy, I deferred to my colleagues who were pursuing a number of amendments. I think also I advised the department that I had a number of issues I wished to raise.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns that have come up with this bill and one of the matters I wish to raise concerns some of the issues the avicultural people have raised with the minister and with the department. I have said before that there seems to be a diversity of views amongst the aviculturalists on particular issues in relation to this bill. Of course, there are a large number of people and a number of groups who are interested in this area. It is probably not surprising that there is some diversity of views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware, and I have had discussions with the department, that, for example, the Avicultural Federation of Australia, I think, is one of the important groups in this area. They have expressed some concerns about the registration scheme for exotic birds. They were concerned initially that the consultation process had not run its full course. But, in view of the fact that the bill had been brought in, I am pleased to say that they then approached us in a very constructive fashion, sought urgent talks with the department and raised a number of issues with the department. At this time I wish to see whether the particular concerns they raised with the department have been effectively addressed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues raised was about the membership of the exotic birds committee. We have had that debate, so I will not canvass those particular issues again; but that was one of their concerns. Another issue I would like to get the minister's views on relates to the time period to review species which may be put on the register. I understand that there are quite a number of steps which will be required and that there are some 300 species to be reviewed. The Avicultural Federation of Australia is concerned that, if adequate consultation is not built into the process, then the scheme is destined to start with a lot of dissatisfied bird keepers. I wonder whether the minister could tell us how the registration scheme will be introduced and what will be the consultative arrangements set up to ensure that those who are involved and have a particular interest have an appropriate input. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, can I reassure Senator Kemp on the question of consultation. There has in fact been widespread consultation in respect of this bill. I will make two short quotes. One is from a letter that was received from a major aviculture group. It reads, `We fail to understand this attitude'&mdash;that is that there has been no discussion&mdash;`as we have been in receipt of five newsletters from ANCA. We have been delighted at the meetings held in various states to allow all aviculturalists to discuss the proposal with staff from ANCA.' A second avicultural group stated, `If any person felt they were not consulted, it would be due to them not availing themselves of the lines of communication available, certainly not through any fault of ANCA.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the process that is going to be engaged upon, Senator Kemp is correct in the number of the species involved&mdash;it is about 300. It is believed that there are around 300 species of exotic birds. Of these, at least 11 species have established feral populations and are already designated as pests. Both the common starling and the common miner are established in the wild in Australia and they do compete with native birds for roost and nest sites, to the detriment of native birds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The magnitude of the potential pest problem requires that those species that do pose a risk should be identified and documented at the national level. The review of pest potential of bird species will be completed by an independent consultant. The list of species to be reviewed has been compiled from information supplied by zoological institutions, states with a registration system already in place and a list referred from the aviculture industry. So the industry itself is in fact cooperating with this exercise in providing relevant information to the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contract is due for completion by December this year. The consultants will be required to assess approximately 270 species on their agricultural and environmental pest potential.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the decision making process will directly involve aviculture, through representation on the exotic bird committee, affected individuals will be aware of what birds will be subject to the scheme well in advance of it coming into effect.

It is true that some groups have mentioned that the consultation process went well, as far as they were concerned, and that other groups were less than happy. It is important that every attempt is made to ensure that all major groups feel that the consultative process has been worked through properly. As I said, as a result of my discussions with Mr Ian Woolcock, the Chairman of the Avicultural Federation of Australia, I know that that organisation has expressed concerns.

If you look at that relevant Queensland act, you will find those powers in there.

Item 4 provides that management programs currently in force which have not had a time period of approval included in the declaration cease to be approved on the operation of the amendments. The view of one of the state governments was that this seemed to be unduly restrictive and it would seem to be more appropriate to allow a longer period for such programs to be replaced.</PARA></TALK.START>

The currently approved program provides for an export industry which has been estimated to be worth $15 million each year. Exports would be jeopardised if the current program approval is revoked prior to agreement being reached on a replacement program. I understand that negotiations with ANCA over such a replacement program are in a difficult phase and it may take some time to reach a suitable agreement on a replacement program. The view that was put was that it may be more sensible to include in the bill a provision that programs currently approved for an unspecified period remain approved for, say, two years after the amendments enter into force, thereby giving adequate time for negotiations on a replacement program. I wonder whether the minister can address those specific concerns. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not support the Democrats' amendment. This is a bill with savings of $141 million over four years to 1998-99 and those savings are an important part of this government's overall economic program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not support this measure. They are opposing a fair and equitable measure that it is fiscally responsible. They are opposing an opportunity for some 31,000 extra families to have a place in child-care centres. They are opposing the return to a fair balance between the priority for working families and work related care and up to 12 hours of occasional care for families with one parent not in the paid work force. This is an absolute hypocrisy on the part of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I want to pick up on the points made by Senator Minchin in his contribution. He said on a number of occasions that the opposition supports women who want to be at home with their children, that he does absolutely. In the same breath he then says that they should be entitled to 50 hours child-care assistance. That is a nonsense. If you want to be at home with your children, why on earth would you want to have them in child care for 50 hours?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the arguments put in other places, and seemingly endorsed by you, was that some families benefit from having child care, that they are not really very good at being parents and that child care is better for them. That is an absolute insult to the parents in Australia. It is an absolute insult to suggest that parents cannot cope with their children and that the way they cope is by sending them off to child care. If you want to support women being home with their children&mdash;it is usually women that you talk about&mdash;why on earth would you be insisting that they have an entitlement to 50 hours child care? Secondly, I remember Senator Minchin saying that there is no guarantee the savings in this legislation would be achieved. I tell you what: if you oppose it, it is absolutely certain that they will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) are very interested in the behaviour of the opposition on this piece of legislation. Yesterday you were asking questions about increases in taxes. You were asking about this government not reducing its deficit. You were asking about the impact on family. But when it comes to the opportunity to put your own seeming preferred view into effect, you will not support this government in its fiscally responsible, fair and equitable process in this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have also made some comment about the cost of child care to government rising by up to 18 per cent a year over the last number of years. Absolutely. That is because we have established a child-care program and seen its massive expansion. One of the reasons we had to do that was that for seven years the Fraser government did nothing about child care. Your policies now, you tell us, are hypothetical. Your policies then were nonexistent. Of course it is this government's commitment to expanding child care. We do not blush for that increase. You go around as though it is some kind of negative. It is a very big plus. Ask the families of Australia whether they appreciate child care, whether they appreciate their child-care assistance, whether they appreciate the opportunity to participate in the work force or to study or to train or to do voluntary work if it is contributing to their employment prospects&mdash;all of those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me straight on to Senator Minchin's notion that we have in this bill&mdash;I think you were saying it is in this bill&mdash;a 19th century definition of work. The only thing 19th century in this place is you. You cited the example of your wife maybe doing some voluntary work. If people are doing voluntary work towards getting employment, that is covered under the bill. You have got completely out of touch arrangements. If a person is working in the paid work force, if a person is studying, if a person is training, if a person is looking for work, that person remains as entitled to the child-care assistance as ever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would be hard-pressed to find a family who would want child care assistance for a reason other than it would be a benefit for them or an opportunity for them to visit a doctor or attend other appointments or whatever. Most families are busy doing all those things I have described. We have also allowed for the concerns of families with an emergency. Let us say a parent is taken sick or some other crisis happens. Then, of course, those families will be eligible for child-care assistance to cover them for whatever hours are needed during the time of that emergency. The same applies for families with a child with a disability or children of parents with a disability and families at risk. All of those categories remain the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are trying to make sure that the priority for work related care and our continuing commitment to occasional care is back in balance. I made that point during the committee hearing, and I say it again. In most cases, the median figure of hours used by families for occasional child care is 12 hours. That figure was not an arbitrary choice. The figure very closely corresponds with what families use in preschool and/or kindergarten and have been using for many years now. A successful program for children in the naught to five years group can be implemented in those sorts of hours. It has been a lovely assistance to families over all those years. It seemed entirely appropriate to settle on that figure, particularly as it corresponded with the median use of people using occasional care in our long day care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has set in place a child-care system of which we can be proud, but we do not rest on our laurels. We continue to look for improvement. We continue to look for that improvement in the delivery of services and in offering more flexibility and in funding arrangements. We do have&mdash;and I note Senator Lees referred to this&mdash;COAG, the Council of Australian Governments, examining the roles and responsibilities of the Commonwealth states in a Commonwealth process that is looking at administration and funding arrangements; not at the priority of access, not at the balance between work related and occasional care but at the best administration and funding arrangements, areas of duplication and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if COAG does come up with suggestions and ways in which we can best provide more or better family friendly services and what I call seamless delivery of services for families in the naught to five or preschool age group, none of that, in any way, contradicts the intention of this legislation&mdash;none of it. That COAG document will also be complemented by the EPAC inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government, child care, as most people would know, has been elevated to a very significant economic issue. It is not a welfare issue but a very critical part of our labour market programs and our economic policies. Child care is crucially important to Australia's economic and social development. EPAC is going to be looking at the long-term goals for child care and what its place might have to be in five or 10 years time. It is not about what we might want to do today, tomorrow or next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the Fraser government wanted nothing to do with child care, and now the opposition has gone from opposing the legislation to agreeing to defer it only as cheap political opportunism. As we heard yesterday, the opposition has a hypothetical child-care policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has expanded child care and child-care subsidies. The primary focus of the program is to assist families in the work force to manage their work and family commitments. Occasional care, as I have said, has always been an important part of the program. We have always recognised the importance of child care for families when one parent was at home, not for respite because that is covered under the priority of access but for take a break arrangements and so on when parents might have an appointment or some other requirement in their lives where they would be assisted by not having their little children along with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that certainly has not been touted by the opposition is that under this legislation the present limit of four hours of occasional care in occasional care centres would have increased to 12 hours. I hope you all appreciate what you have just done: continue the restriction of occasional care through occasional care centres. Four hours in those centres at the moment would have been extended to 12 under this legislation. That would have given many more families greater opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of child-care assistance going to families with a parent at home has been increasing by two percentage points a year over the last few years. If this trend continues, up to 35 per cent of child-care assistance outlays could be for non-work-related care. This change would not have affected most centres but it clearly affects some centres, particularly those in certain parts of Queensland, where up to 40 per cent of the hours, and sometimes even more, are used for occasional care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To skew the fairness and equity of this program across the whole country, you have bought a pup. To assist some child-care centres&mdash;and no parents&mdash;you are actually prepared to defer this piece of legislation. In fact, the opposition is putting a cover on its opposition to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that 31,000 extra families would have an opportunity to participate in child care. You are denying them that. If you are in, whacko, you can keep it and go for it. If you are out, too bad. That is the opposition approach to fairness and equity. It is not ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just make it clear that all the parents concerned about this who have contacted our office have made it absolutely clear that it does not appeal at all to be charged for 12 hours child care when you are using it for only four. The idea of paying for the four, five or six hours of child care they actually use, rather than the 12 hours they are being charged for, is particularly attractive to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of main concern here are the centres which may have difficulty with their charging practices. The government was and still is prepared to help any of those centres. We are not about making it difficult: we are about giving support in every way possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees made the point that you cannot go changing horses in midstream, to use a metaphor, meaning you cannot change the practices that child-care centres came into business with an understanding of. No child-care centre was set up on the understanding that it could operate on 50, 60 or 70 per cent occasional care. If it was, it was ignoring the priority of access guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind you that it was only a couple of years ago that we tightened the child-care assistance entitlement whereby centres were charging families for a whole week when children were only using care for only two days. There was a considerable amount of double-dipping. No centre in Australia admitted it was doing it but we have saved over $9 million since we tightened the screws on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was clearly a change of practice affecting centres but no centre was prepared to defend the double-dipping. I appreciate the point you are making, that we need to ensure that things are not made impossible for centres but, on balance, with a considerable amount of thought, this legislation and the government's approach takes account of other needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that needs to be said is that the action of delaying this legislation will effectively consign many families to continued unemployment. These are opportunities lost that will be bitterly felt by those families. It will also disadvantage non-working families, whom those opposite are claiming to champion. As I have said, some 31,000 families, many with one parent not working, will not be able to get places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have given the government's definition of `work'. If that is 19th century, all I can say is poor Senator Minchin. If he thinks that our work-related program of entitlements for child-care assistance is a 19th century concept, he certainly has not been reading his history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things we recognised with people returning to the work force&mdash;particularly with women&mdash;is that, if they had to train, study or do a bridging course, child care assistance was just as important then as it was when they finally went into the paid work force. Our child care arrangements have always had that preparatory stage as a critical part of work related definitions. I suspect that there was nothing in the 19th century definitions that entitled women to study or train at all, much less get child care assistance while they did it. So Senator Minchin is hopelessly out of date on that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also explained at length the reason why we have set the figure of 12 hours. It is not an arbitrary figure. As I pointed out in the committee hearings, it is the median use of child care for families. A very significant number of families would not be affected at all, and a few would have to drop their hours by a couple only. The 12 hours is broadly in line with&mdash;and, in many instances, more generous than&mdash;the level of developmental sessions provided for in the largely state funded preschools. Rather than disadvantaging families with a parent at home, this initiative will enable many of those families who currently cannot access child care or who can access only a very limited number of hours to increase their access to 12 hours. The government opposes the deferral of this piece of legislation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the attention of the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) specifically to paragraph (3) of my amendment, where I go through some of the reasons for postponing the consideration of this bill. If the minister were to read my speech and look through the committee stage of this legislation, she would also find some other reasons. She questioned, for example, why some families want more than 12 hours in category 4, and most of that was addressed in the committee process and during the speeches yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the minister's attention to paragraph (3) of the amendment and the fact that the government is undergoing a series of different planning proposals relating to child care. Also, the Australian Early Childhood Association and the National Children's Services Forum are looking at planning models for the industry. It simply is not good enough for you to decide out of the blue that you are going to change the rules without looking at all the implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have come in here and suggested that those savings are concrete and absolutely justified, but I accept Senator Minchin's discussions yesterday when we looked at this&mdash;there is no justification for picking those numbers. Worse than that, those numbers are forward estimates. You have argued&mdash;and you argued during the committee stage&mdash;that you are not trying to bankrupt any centres, particularly those in Queensland, which are over-reliant on category 4. During the committee hearings, the department said that it was looking at forward estimates and trying to discourage new centres from setting up in areas where there are already plenty of services for category 4 children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message we are sending by not throwing this legislation out&mdash;which was our alternative&mdash;but by deferring it for several months is that we are still looking at the issue. As I said in my speech yesterday, the system is in a mess. Not even local government can tell those people who are interested in setting up a centre how many centres are on their books, where the centres are operating and how many children are accessing them. That basic information is not available for people who are looking at going into the child care industry, so we need a planning process in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People will be certainly warned, after hearing of this long process in the Senate, that they really need to do their homework. Even community based centres in our own state, Minister, are being caught in this net. One centre is opening in Noarlunga after many years of pressure only to find that a private centre has already been established there. Even in our home state, we see cases where, because there is no planning, extra services are going into some areas while there are still no services in others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the 31,000 extra places, it really amazes me where you can get that figure from if the category priority system&mdash;category 1, 2, 3 and 4&mdash;is operating. If you are going to police it properly and make sure it is operating, you will solve a lot of the problems that you are arguing about anyway. If there are category 4 parents in with category 1 parents&mdash;in other words, those parents who are working and waiting to get in&mdash;priority of access rules apply. The centre needs to explain to those category 4 parents that they are sorry, but there are category 1 parents waiting, so they need to either shuffle their requirements or leave the child care service altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So where, Minister, you get 31,000 extra places from, I really have to wonder. Surely the only shuffle is going to be between category 4 and category 4&mdash;not, as you were suggesting, having working parents having to go on the dole or lose their jobs. In inner Melbourne already, people can go from centre to centre and find that they are absolutely full. There is no full-time, five days a week care available. While there are a few category 4 people in there, they are generally only taking up a half or maybe 1 1/2 to two days. So for your suggestion that we are in any way, through our actions in this place, disadvantaging parents who are now trying to get into the work force, I really would like to see some specific evidence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On behalf of the coalition, I would like to make a contribution to the reasons why we are supporting Senator Lees's amendment. As the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) questioned the reasons why the coalition was supporting the amendment, I feel that in the interests of transparency in the Senate it is certainly fitting that I should give the reasons for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the minister to display her total overreaction to the position announced by the coalition I find absolutely astonishing. As she has pointed out, I, representing the coalition, said in the second reading debate that we were opposing the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, and that has not changed. We simply would like to take a much longer look at the bill to see whether some of the reasons that the minister has quoted in her speech are really going to apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, Minister, it is not the coalition that has changed its mind; it is the government that has changed its mind. Mr Keating in his election speeches in 1993, as you very well remember, announced that child care was a right. Now it is not a right. As Senator Chamarette pointed out in the second reading debate yesterday, suddenly we have women who deserve child care and we have women who do not deserve child care, and that will come about if this legislation put forward by the government is passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is coming to a reasoned decision, which we want to look at over a period of time. Why is this political opportunism? We are simply thinking the issues through, and I do not see how opposition to the bill necessarily countermands a long look at the legislation. You talked about being fair and equitable to parents. How can you say that when you are slamming the door of child care in the faces of people who need it, and people who are seeking it, on a basis that has so far been commercially available?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the position of centres which have taken a commercial decision to cater for the non-working portion of the child-care market? What happens to them? You say that they should have known under your guidelines that their priority of access should be for working parents. What about centres in rural and remote areas? You know very well that the major proportion of the market for those particular centres is not for the working part of the population; it is for people who need occasional care, and suddenly you are saying that they cannot have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will remember, Minister, that in the committee inquiry into this legislation I asked your department this: what would centres do if they had taken a commercial decision to cater for that end of the market and suddenly found that, with the passing of this legislation, part of their market was chopped out? The answer of your department was that those child-care centres should simply relocate. Come on! How do we go about relocating bricks and mortar or suddenly shifting a commercial operation from where you have chosen to have it to another part of Australia? This just is not possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You also know very well that the expansion of child-care centres under your department has been totally unplanned, that there is an oversupply in some areas and that there is no supply in others. As Senator Lees has witnessed, people are driving around looking for work related care, but to do it this way and to regulate the market is not the way to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A friend of my daughter who is expecting a baby in December recently spent several days looking for a place for that child because she wishes to return to part-time nursing after the baby is born. She is unable to find a place within a large area of suburban Melbourne. This is a total indictment on your so-called planning processes. If your planning processes are so brilliant, how is it that the very large expansion in child-care centres has not been better regulated? What you are trying to do is use a financial and an hours regulation to take the place of the planning process. That is simply not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Witnesses at the recent Senate inquiry said to us that, if the existing priority guidelines were made to work properly, there would be no need for this new legislation. Senator Lees has certainly gone along with that. Why aren't the priority guidelines working properly? Is this because your department does not see that they are implemented properly or make the positions clear to centres? What is it? Again, it is an indictment on your department and your administration of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interests of a proper look at this legislation, which will affect thousands of children, thousands of families and many child-care centres throughout Australia, we believe that further consideration of the bill should be postponed and we should look at it again on Monday, 20 November. At the moment, the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee has a reference on early childhood and the planning mechanisms that are in operation in the early childhood area. Witness after witness has said that the child-care centre program at the moment is in chaos and that many people are simply not aware of what is available and where it is. Again, I suggest that this is an indictment on your department. Therefore, the coalition are supporting the amendment moved by Senator Lees. </PARA>

That is an absolute nonsense. It is a Dickensian view of what is work and what is not. It is a nonsensical approach to the lives of modern Australian women. It does not fit in with the way they live, how they work and how they operate in the community. That is why we think this legislation is so wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to the correspondence I guess we have all had from the Australian Federation of Child Care Associations, which describes the current situation as a `major crisis'. It says that if this proposal goes ahead it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will result in the closure of some services, the loss of child care workers' jobs, an increase in long day care fees for all parents . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It reminds the government that up until now it has apparently respected the parents' right to make their own decisions regarding the need for child care. That clearly will not be the case after the passage of this. There will be this arbitrary bang: once you hit 12, that is it&mdash;out; forget it. You are denied access to child care.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . child care centres who have made financial commitments based on current government policy are now finding that their investments are being endangered and in some cases destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA>The federation goes on in that vein, criticising what it properly regards as an unconscionable restriction:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The limiting of hours for Non Work Related Child Care Assistance will decrease the number of places available, due to the closure of centres.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement made by the Federation of Child Care Associations, who ought to know. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of child care for all parents will rise as a result of this decision, the number of available services will drop and non working, single, low income families will be discriminated against . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is why we oppose this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federation has given us several case studies of families affected by this bill. I will draw the Senate's attention to one particular case which I think is quite glaring and shows how nonsensical this proposition is. The case study reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One income family, caring for two children aged 6 months and 2 years. Living in a flat without a garden or playground. This family is dependent on one low income and needs Child Care Assistance to access child care for the older child.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 2 year old is very active, enjoys the company of other children in a centre setting and has been attending the nearest child care centre (which is 45 minutes distance by car) for 3 days a week. This enables the parent at home to spend individual time with the infant&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the six-month-old child&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the older child to benefit from regular time at the centre. The centre is able, over the 3 days, to provide continuity of developmental experiences for the 2 year old. The child has the opportunity to access a playground and a variety of toys over the 3 days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This family is now limited to 12 hours of child care for their 2 year old. This means the child can only stay 1 full day or two morning or afternoon sessions&mdash;when it has previously become used to attending on Mon, Wed and Fridays.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a classic case of a low income family struggling on one income. The parents who are trying to do the right thing by their children will be disastrously affected by what the minister is proposing in this bill. Several other case studies to that effect have been given where people will be badly hurt by what the government is proposing in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me the problem largely is that the government's approach to child care&mdash;which this federation says is now crisis ridden&mdash;is, in a sense, producer driven; it is not consumer driven. You are not motivated by giving consumers of child care the maximum flexibility, the maximum choice in the arrangements they want to make as to how they bring up their children. This limit of 12 hours cuts right across that. It does restrict and limit the access of consumers of child care in a way which, as I have said, I think is unconscionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the government is clearly driven by wanting to save money&mdash;and, as we have said, because we think government expenditure is out of control, that is not an unreasonable motivation. But this is not the way to go about it. This is not the way to achieve savings. We have had evidence to the effect that this could well result in much less saving than the government has predicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are well on record as indicating&mdash;and have the credentials in this area to do so&mdash;where we think expenditure savings can be made. We will say again and again that the child-care cash rebate should be income tested. At the moment it is a totally non-income tested subsidy for the use of child care which very high income families have access to and which is, in effect, a subsidy paid for by some of these low income families who will now be hurt by this 12-hour limit which the government has placed on low income families. They will now no longer have access to child care but their taxes, in effect, will be going to subsidise rich families having access without any restriction whatsoever to the child-care cash rebate. I repeat: we are on record as saying that the child-care cash rebate should be income tested, which would produce savings to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we do ask the government to seriously rethink this legislation. We think it is wrong and, in this instance, we support the Democrats' amendment to give the government time to rethink this bill and, hopefully, withdraw it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Senator Lees, it is important to know that what is proposed in this legislation is necessary, or can be judged as being necessary, whether or not you ever have a planning process. This is about making sure that there is a fair spread of access to child-care places right now. You must ensure that you do not confuse the two. It is very important that we do get that priority of access clarified and operating. From listening to Senator Troeth in particular, it certainly seems that she contradicts herself entirely in terms of saying that you cannot get any places, and there is no need for priority of access.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, listening to Senator Troeth, she would suggest that what we are doing now is stopping occasional care, that mothers at home cannot have access and that the whole world is about to change. In fact, all we are doing is making clear the priority of access guidelines and allowing the 12-hour limit for the non-work related care as it is defined. You need to tell the truth here and not obfuscate, as you have been doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An opposition that says, `We oppose this bill, but we do not really want to oppose it until November,' is a daft opposition, if ever I have heard one. Do you oppose it or not? We know why you are not opposing it today. You have opposed it in the other place. You oppose the bill, but you say, `We think we'll leave our opposition until November'&mdash;not because the Democrats, or the government or the Greens might come up with your support, but because you oppose it. You are on the record as opposing it, but you would like to wait around and oppose it in November. It is absolutely pathetic. You have said it. You have confessed out of your own mouth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that is important to remind all listeners is that there is still a very significant unmet demand for children between the age of nought and two. In Queensland already there is a change happening. Some of the centres, recognising the importance for changing, are taking many more children between the ages of nought and two, particularly the 12 months and older age group. That change is already happening. That is the sort of change we would like to encourage in centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Centres that are looking at a restriction or a limit on the number of people coming to them properly have to look at where else there will be commercial opportunity for them&mdash;and that is in moving into baby places. The number of baby places in the private child-care centres is still very significantly less than the baby places in the community based sector. If you want to make serious commercial decisions, then you go where the opportunity is. Some of the centres are beginning to do that, even before the 12-hour occasional care was put in. So you will find that the good centres, the financially viable centres, the centres that are really able to make the best of it, are already making those moves and they are picking up the opportunities for meeting the work related needs of families with children between the ages of nought and two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Troeth made a point about rural and remote areas, where we know that most of the care is occasional care. You could count in a very small number the private centres that have opened in rural and remote areas. The rural and remote centres have been put there by the community based sector and the government is setting them up precisely because we want to go to an equitable distribution of child-care centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Troeth says that there is no planning. It is a scandal to so deliberately misrepresent the facts. The high needs areas are defined across all the states. Our community based, our family daycare, our occasional care and our outside school hours care centres have all been based on needs and planning for distribution. That is actually the case. The reason we are in the rural and remote areas is that we recognise the need there and we have been prepared to put the centres there. So if we want to talk in a serious tone and talk facts, let us do that. Let us not so skew the facts, which is what it looks as though you are deliberately intending to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The planning process for the community based centres, for the family daycare, for the government centres has always been there. That is why there is the distribution of child-care centres across the country that we have. The problems that Senator Lees mentioned about the failure to be able to get a child-care place in the heart of Melbourne because most of the centres are filled with work related care is a very important point. A very large number of the centres said that this proposal would not affect them at all, because 99 per cent of the children or families using them are there for exactly that reason&mdash;work related care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we have put so many places up, there is still an unmet demand for work related care and it is not even across the state. We are saying that, in centres where non-work related care is provided in large part to many of the families, it is time for those centres to rethink and to modify so as to look at meeting work related needs as a priority. Some of those centres do not even maintain waiting lists. They do not canvass the work related needs in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was fascinated to find out that Senator Troeth and Senator Minchin want planning, regulations and all those sorts of things. It would be interesting to know what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) thinks about planning and regulations. On the one hand, those opposite say that they want no interference and that they want to let the market get on with it but, on the other hand, they suddenly want all this direction. They are contradicting themselves; they have been caught saying one thing and then saying something else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition, in standing up and speaking to the amendment, have made real idiots of themselves. They say, `We oppose this bill, but we think we'll wait until November to oppose it.' Senator Lees has made her argument quite clear. At  least she has put up an amendment. She has actually spelled out the reasons why she thinks we should defer it. I do not agree with her, and I do not agree with the decision to defer it, but it puts her streets ahead of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind Senator Lees that I do not think it is persuasive to say that the Early Childhood Association or the National Children's Services Forum will be looking at this area and coming up with all sorts of proposals. In the meantime, people cannot find places in child-care centres. If it is a fully work related child-care centre, then it is a matter of recognising the fact that unmet demand, which is one of the factors we take into account in allocating places, certainly means that there is a need for more places. But, in other parts of Australia besides urban Melbourne, there is still a large amount of unmet demand for work. That unmet demand for work is running alongside centres that have got places occupied by occasional care users. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is just the data, Senator. They are the facts. I have already commented on the COAG paper. It is not about to change the nature of child care this week or next week. It is not about to recognise or create places or any of those things. It looks at how better we can balance child care and preschools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Troeth, that just reminds me of that extraordinary remark you made about what would happen if centres had to relocate. Over the years, centres have to relocate; kindergartens have to relocate; schools have to relocate. Talking about relocation reminds me to ask you: just how many school relocations has Premier Kennett put onto the Victorian people in the last 12 months? Just how many child-care centres and preschools has Premier Kennett relocated in Victoria? Of course relocation sometimes happens. In fact, Mr Kennett is making an art form of it. Community based centres may have to relocate; private centres may have to relocate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the whole, while we still have a large amount of unmet demand, we do not anticipate centres closing. It is certainly not my intention to see them closing. As much as possible, we are about helping them to change their charging practices, to create waiting lists and to test the water for the unmet demand across this country, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales, so that they can face the problems confronted by parents who are working and who cannot get a place for their children under two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a massive demand. The demand is so significant that we are now looking at two levels of high need areas to assist centres in planning. We are drawing the high need areas on the current figures and drawing a new set of high need areas based on the needs for work related care for children under two. There are opportunities. There is still a lot unmet demand. We still have a skewing of the system in some parts. This process would have set this balance in train to get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Minchin, we are not driving a wedge between women at home and women at work. The opportunity for women to use occasional care and for women to use work related care has been part of the child-care policy since we set up this program and moved with the development of child care. You may want to argue about the difference between 12 hours, 10 hours and 14 hours, but it is also part of the process. It is not saying that this is a dramatic shift. We have always recognised the need for women at home to have the opportunity to use child care. To suggest that we are now cutting it out, that this is going to drive a wedge between families or that if you are at the tuckshop you cannot use child care is way over the top, Senator. You know it. You ought to apologise to people for so misrepresenting the facts. We are about making child care available to many more families than currently receive it. It is fair; it is appropriate; it is fiscally responsible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Electoral and Referendum Bill, which is, in effect, bill (No. 1). We had anticipated that both this bill and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) would be debated together. I will certainly be speaking on the basis that the two bills are to be debated concurrently. My remarks will be directed to both bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From an opposition point of view, we do find the way in which the amendments to the Electoral Act are being dealt with very odd indeed. Why they are being split into two bills has never been made clear to us. Why we are not dealing with both bills together is still not all that clear to us. The process by which these bills are being dealt with is messy. The bills are a response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the conduct of the 1993 federal election, yet we still have not had from the government a formal response to that report. It is normal for there to be a response and then legislation flows from that formal response to a committee report. That pays committees due respect. In this case we have the legislation before any formal government response to the committee report. That is most unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the recommendations in the report have bipartisan support and are implemented in these two bills. They are mostly technical and are designed to improve the conduct of federal elections. They deal with matters like silent electors, enrolment objection process, canvassing in hospitals and nursing homes, authorisation of advertising material, roll reviews, overseas electors, close of rolls, bulk nominations, interstate voting, and procedures relating to the Court of Disputed Returns. We do support this bill and bill (No. 2), which we had expected to be debating today as well, but we will be moving amendments to both bills. I would like to comment on a number of those specific issues and also on amendments proposed by the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the matter of Australian Electoral Commission advertising, which is dealt with in this bill. The government proposes to remove the requirement that the writs for elections and notices relating to redistributions be advertised in not less than two newspapers circulating generally in each state or territory. The government wants to change that requirement to just one newspaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really do not believe that the current requirement relating to newspaper advertisements should be changed. We do not see any reason for that. In our two larger states, the government's amendment could deprive a very large number of voters of information about elections. There are two newspapers circulating generally in both New South Wales and Victoria, but in each state one of the two newspapers has much lower circulation than the other. On that basis and given that it is possible under the amendment for the commission to choose in each of our two major states the newspaper which has the least circulation, we do not think this particular proposal is justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also an amendment relating to gender I wish to comment on. The government is proposing that information relating to the gender of voters be provided for the purpose of medical research and health screening surveys. We do support that amendment. However, we do propose that it be extended to allow gender information to be provided to senators, members and political parties. Our understanding is that the government is prepared to accept that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We put that proposal for a number of reasons. In commonsense there cannot be privacy implications about gender. One's gender is generally obvious. The proposal will ensure that MPs and political parties do address voters correctly and not get the gender wrong in writing to voters. It does acknowledge the fact that the major parties already have computer programs which enable them, with a fairly high degree of accuracy, to determine gender anyway. So we think it is sensible to allow that information to be provided, and we understand that the government accepts that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a matter of age discrimination, which I would like to mention. We do intend to move amendments to prohibit age discrimination within the Electoral Commission. We are waiting to see if the government can sort this matter out. Subject to receiving some information about that, we will proceed with our amendment. It is in response to complaints from many casual employees of the commission who are denied employment once they reach a certain age&mdash;and that is 65. The government has said the amendment we propose would put the AEC out of step with all other government agencies and that there would be a more appropriate legislative vehicle for removal&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The government has been saying this for years and years. Colleagues of my mine who have been here longer than me say, `We've heard that one from the government before, and we still haven't seen anything.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paradoxically, I noticed in the media the other day that, in relation to the National Gallery, the government itself is considering amending legislation to allow Mrs Betty Churcher to stay beyond the compulsory retirement age of 65 years. The spokesman for the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mr Lee, confirmed yesterday that amending the act was a possibility and could be done this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government itself is looking to do in relation to the National Gallery what we believe needs to be done in relation to the Australian Electoral Commission. So we really do not believe the government's opposition is well founded. However, if the government can convince us that it can make arrangements to allow casual employees over the age of 65 to be employed by the Electoral Commission, then we will certainly give that favourable consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the matter of general postal voters. We acknowledge and express our gratitude that the government has accepted our proposal that voters on the register of general postal voters be sent ballot papers as soon as they are received by the relevant DRO without the need to complete a postal vote application form. As we say, we record our appreciation of the government for accepting what is a sensible reform. It will make it much easier for remote voters, in particular, to participate in elections. We will move an amendment to further improve the government's amendment, and we understand the government is prepared to accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will touch on the matter of prisoner voting. Although it is not dealt with directly in the bill before us, it is dealt with in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2). I want to place on record our position on that matter. The government was originally intending to remove any restriction on the right of prisoners to enrol and vote. Following our strident opposition to that proposal and what was a remarkable community outrage about it, we are pleased to see the government has withdrawn that unacceptable proposition, although I understand it still remains part of the Labor platform. Labor still remains, in its platform, committed to letting all prisoners vote, no matter what the seriousness of their offence is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We acknowledge that the current arrangements relating to prisoners are unworkable&mdash;that has been made quite clear to us&mdash;in that the disqualification refers to the maximum possible penalty for the offence and not the actual sentence being served. We do welcome the government's recognition of the need for some restriction on prisoners' voting rights, which they have now had to concede. We also agreed that it should be based on the actual sentence, which is what the government is proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a strong view that the actual sentence which triggers the disqualification should be reduced from five years to 12 months. It is our view that if someone commits an offence serious enough to be placed in a prison for 12 months or more, they should lose the right to vote while they are in prison. Punishment of 12 months or more in prison should involve the loss of the entitlement to vote. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JX4">Senator MINCHIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That would appear to be the case. The 12-month period was, of course, in the Electoral Act before Labor came to office. While it was based on maximum possible sentence, the period of disqualification was 12 months. We opposed the government when it changed it to five years, so our position is consistent. We have been consistent right throughout on this issue. I also make the point that it is consistent with the period of imprisonment which disqualifies someone from being a member of parliament. Frankly, we do not see why prisoners, some of whom have committed horrendous crimes, should be treated more favourably in relation to their right to vote than members of parliament are treated in relation to their right to sit in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change we propose would also bring the law into line with that prevailing in New South Wales, the biggest state and the state with the biggest prison population. In fact, half the prisoners in Australia are in New South Wales prisons. It therefore makes eminent sense for Commonwealth law to accord with the law in the state of New South Wales; that is, a 12-month disqualification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that the government was originally intending to prohibit canvassing within six metres of a divisional returning office or a prepoll voting office. We indicated our concern about that prohibition and we are grateful that the government has seen fit to remove that proposal. The government was also proposing, I think at the behest of the Electoral Commission, that preliminary scrutiny of declaration votes could commence on the Monday prior to polling day. We were also very concerned about the proposal. Again, we are grateful for the government's removing that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very important issue that will be debated in the discussion of these bills is truth in advertising. Senator Lees, on behalf of the Democrats, will be moving an amendment to provide for truth in advertising which, in effect, will restore the old section 329(2) of the Electoral Act. Of course, that was put in by the Labor Party. The Labor Party itself introduced that section in 1983. It got close to the 1984 election and thought, `We might want to lie our way back into office in 1984. Let's get rid of this section as quickly as possible.' So they tossed it out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have given this matter very careful consideration in the meantime. We have taken a decision that we will support this amendment. It is our view that recent ALP advertising campaigns, at both the state and federal levels, have been so utterly dishonest and deceptive that a provision of the kind proposed is now required to ensure that Australians get honest elections. We call on the government to show its bone fides and support this amendment as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is almost certain that the ALP will have already prepared an advertising campaign for the next federal election which is deliberately designed to mislead and deceive voters about coalition policies. We have no doubt that you have John Singleton and Bob Hogg beavering away, working out what outrageous claims they can make about coalition policies. You will say and do anything to lie your way back into office. When you announce the election, then you will see the policies. Just tell us when the election is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note your words of caution. In the ideal world an amendment to provide for truth in political advertising should not be necessary. It would be much better if Australian political parties conducted themselves with some integrity and some respect for truth and honesty, then such a law would not be necessary. It is quite clear to us, following the ALP campaign, in particular, in 1993 that such a law is necessary. The ALP campaign in that election was, in our view, utterly dishonest and misleading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now reached a point where the Electoral Act should make it an offence to produce electoral advertisements that are clearly dishonest and deceptive. We do not think any party should be able to mislead the electors in such a way that it gets back into office with impunity. That is our view of what happened in 1993. All those chickens will come home to roost in 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to support the proposed amendment. We challenge the government to accept this amendment in the interests of ensuring honest elections in Australia. I point out that such a provision, as proposed by the Democrats, has operated in South Australia in the South Australian Electoral Act since 1985. It was put in there by the Bannon Labor government. The Labor Party itself proposed this provision and put it into the South Australian Electoral Act. I had to work under that provision as a state director and was happy to ensure that all Liberal Party ads complied with the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was never any challenge to any of our advertisements during my period as state director. The irony is that it was the state Labor Party secretary in South Australia who was successfully prosecuted for breaching the provision put in there by the Bannon Labor government for producing a misleading and deceptive ad in the state campaign of 1993. He now has a conviction recorded against him. This sort of legislation does work. It has been proved to work in South Australia and it should be part of the federal law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the situation where the Labor Party conducted one of the most deceptive campaigns in Queensland just this year. The Premier of Queensland has had to concede, at the behest of the coalition, that a provision of this kind will be installed into the Queensland Electoral Act. The Commonwealth should do likewise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few other matters I would like to raise in relation to electoral matters. The bill before us and bill No. 2 fail completely to address several other issues which we, the coalition, referred to in the joint standing committee inquiry into the 1993 election. That inquiry did reveal very widespread concern about the integrity of the Australian electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in fact the case that both the government and the Electoral Commission admit our system of electoral enrolment and voting is wide open to fraud and abuse. They make the claim that it is not being abused. They can see it is a walk in walk out, wide open system&mdash;a system designed purely on the basis of the honesty of those who seek to enrol. They say it is not being abused. They cannot prove that it is not being rorted. It is impossible for the government and the Electoral Commission to prove it is not being rorted. They cannot establish there is no systematic and endemic electoral fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a very recent case where fraud was revealed. A gentleman in Victoria, who was seeking to defraud the social security department, successfully enrolled, falsely, 12 individuals on the electoral roll. He was doing this in order to defraud the social security department because at that stage the social security department fairly unwisely relied on the electoral roll as one of its mechanisms for proving the identity of people. The department has since ceased doing that because it also realised how hopeless the electoral roll is to rely on people's identities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That gentleman was convicted for getting 12 false enrolments. It was discovered by the fraud section of the Department of Social Security; it was not discovered by the Australian Electoral Commission. Clearly, the Electoral Commission has no mechanisms by which to detect these people. They cannot tell me how widespread this is, how many other individuals there are who have falsely enrolled 12 other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I gather that this gentleman had found people who had died some 50 years ago, put their names on the roll and found addresses for them. If those names had not been discovered, anyone could have voted in those names and no-one would have known the difference. There is no way to detect whether anybody had voted in the names of those 12 people. We have clear evidence of the rorting of the electoral roll but we do not know how widespread it is and the government cannot tell us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition members of the joint standing committee recommended in the face of all this that, to strengthen the integrity of the system, individuals claiming entitlement to enrolment should be required to provide the Electoral Commission with proof of their identity, together with evidence of citizenship, by production of a birth certificate, a current passport or a certificate of naturalisation. For the integrity of the electoral system which, as we say, is wide open to question, we also recommended that subdivisional voting be reintroduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recommended that the Electoral Commission trial a system of voter cards in a by-election so that when people come to vote they have to establish who they are. Today you can just walk up and say that you are your next-door neighbour, vote in their place and no-one would know the difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition members of that committee went on to say that section 245 of the Electoral Act, which compels electors to vote, be repealed. I do not want to pursue that cause at this stage but it was clear to us that the principle that everybody should be compelled to vote underlines the problem with the integrity of the electoral system. The theory seems to be that if you compel people to vote you have to make it as easy as possible for them to get on the roll and vote. Therefore, section 245 is a major factor in the weakening of the integrity of our electoral system and the accuracy of the electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the government has completely ignored this whole issue. Nowhere in any of these bills is there anything about that. It raises the question of whether the government is happy to preside over a system which is so wide open to fraud and abuse. All you have to do to get on the electoral roll is fill out a form and get it witnessed by another `elector', who could be anybody. That proves absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could easily enrol my 10-year-old son and no-one would know the difference. I am not going to do it&mdash;I am not going to break the law&mdash;but it would be so easy to do. All you have to do is send off a form in the mail. The Electoral Commission just checks to see if the name is on the roll already. If it is not, it is processed and you are on the roll. It is an absolutely hopeless system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very concerned that the government has completely ignored this issue. It is negligent, in our view, in its determination to ignore increasing community concern about the integrity of our electoral system. This recent court case in Victoria exposes just how easy it is to rort the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not oppose this bill or bill No. 2&mdash;which, we presume, we will be debating next week, although that remains to be seen&mdash;however, there are some amendments that we propose. We will support the Australian Democrats' amendment in relation to truth in advertising. We are extremely disappointed that the bills do not go anywhere near far enough in dealing with the problems of the electoral system as identified in the joint standing committee inquiry into the last federal election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also was expecting both the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 to be debated in this place today. After all, they both result from the inquiry into the conduct of the 1993 federal election and matters related to that election. As we have not had any formal response from the government, we presumed that those two bills together made up the bulk of the government's response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to recommendation 9 of that inquiry, which relates to electoral funding and disclosure. Amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act to reflect that recommendation were passed in this place in June 1995. Senator McMullan acknowledged at the time that those amendments did not apply to the specific situation of the Australian Democrats, as we were a single registered party on a national basis, unlike other parties represented in federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assurances were given to us that situation would be rectified. However, despite continuing attempts from my office to address the deficiency and the problem, and several attempts by us to draw up our own amendments, we still have not had an undertaking from the government that they will support us on this issue. Hopefully, by the time we get through to the committee stage&mdash;which will now be around 5 o'clock today because we have a matter of public importance&mdash;we will have some firm undertakings in writing as to how we will proceed. I will still move the amendments we have had drafted&mdash;and they have been circulated&mdash;in the hope that we will have some concrete examples in writing of where the government believes we should be going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned with some of the proposals, particularly those in the Liberal's foreshadowed amendments which would allow the gender of electors to be released for the purposes of medical research and health screening surveys. Our only concern with this is that the Privacy Commissioner needs to make it very clear that there would be no privacy implications. We have been led to understand that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) has written to the Privacy Commissioner asking for that advice, and I will be seeking clarification on that point during the committee stage. We would prefer it if a copy of that letter could be tabled before the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill is actually passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to deal specifically with the issue of truth in advertising, and I will begin by referring to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 12 September 1995 which dealt with public attitudes to federal politicians. The article certainly does not make for very pleasant reading. It stated that 84 per cent of those surveyed believed that we lie at election time to win votes; 56 per cent claimed that they have lost faith in the federal political system; and 79 per cent said that they do not trust us to keep our election promises. I will not go into a debate now as to how much of that is a misinterpretation, how much is the media's fault, et cetera. It is a perception, and it is the perception that we now have to deal with. It is what the public believes, and it is certainly up to us to deal with what is a very alarming set of figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983, the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform recommended a provision prohibiting misleading or deceptive advertising. A bill containing this provision was subsequently passed in December 1983, but this section was subsequently repealed, as has been already mentioned by Senator Minchin, in October 1984 before the federal election. So it was never tested and tried. The arguments that were later brought against it were very dubious, as it was never given the opportunity to be put into practice to see whether or not it actually worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have attempted on a number of occasions over the years to have that provision or a very similar one reinstated. I want to congratulate my former colleague Senator Michael Macklin, who attempted to do this by amendment in 1984, 1987 and 1989. In 1990, he introduced his own private member's bill, in frustration. Senator Cheryl Kernot similarly moved amendments in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has already been said, in my home state of South Australia, the state Electoral Act does contain a very similar provision&mdash;one put in there by the Labor Party. After the 1993 state election, a successful prosecution was mounted under that particular provision. I am very pleased to say that for a range of reasons, as outlined by Senator Minchin, the opposition will now be supporting the Democrats' stance on this issue. We have changed our amendments slightly to take on board some, indeed all, of the Liberal Party's concerns. What our amendments now reflect is basically the South Australian legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made a very careful assessment of the necessary changes and done all of that so that what we basically have almost verbatim is the South Australian legislation. Quite simply, the amendments that I will be moving in committee will make it an offence for an authorised person to print, publish or distribute any electoral advertisement which is untrue and is, or is likely to be, misleading or deceptive. The amendment allows a defence against prosecution if the person concerned can prove that he or she did not know that the material was untrue, misleading or deceptive. In addition, the provisions of this amendment will only be effective during the relevant period of an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should the prosecution under the terms of this amendment succeed, as happened in South Australia, a person will be up for a penalty of only $1,000, and we have specifically excluded the possibility of a prison sentence from these amendments. If the offence is committed by a party or a corporate body, it is $5,000, and I have already had it put to me by people not in this place that that is nowhere near adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, however, believe that at least we need to take this first step and, if necessary, there may be some changes, some tightening or some alterations later down the track. But right now I believe what we should be looking at is the fact that the South Australian legislation has worked and that that legislation should be at least mirrored in Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the state parliaments now, and I think particularly after the Queensland election, there are also moves afoot to bring in these changes. As has been mentioned, both the Leader of the Opposition and the Queensland Premier have signalled that they will be supporting such measures and, I understand, are in the process of doing something about it. Recently, across my desk came a copy of a press release from a New South Wales state member, Michael Richardson. It was headed `Subject political advertising to the Trade Practices Act says MP'. So I think we have another state also moving along these lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons for the removal of this provision that was given when it was taken out in 1984 was the fear that innocent people could be unwittingly charged with publishing misleading advertisements&mdash;for example, the printers of leaflets or perhaps some poor volunteer who is out letterboxing how-to-vote cards. In my amendment I have made it very clear that they cannot be affected. My proposed amendment is quite clear in that the only people who will be liable under the legislation are those who are authorising that material; in other words, the ones who authorise the publication or, in the case of television and radio ads, the broadcasting of such an advertisement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we in this place should care about the cynicism, the indifference and the hostilities shown towards politicians by the electors. Unfortunately, that is very often evident as I address school groups. It is not so evident up front when addressing adult audiences, but it often comes out during questions. It is now over to the Labor Party to seriously consider&mdash;as this is going to pass through this house&mdash;their attitude to what Australians are telling us, and telling us very clearly; that is, that they believe we should take some concrete steps to clean up our act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we have an obligation to help restore people's faith and confidence in our system of government. I believe that a provision of this nature in the Commonwealth Electoral Act will send a clear signal to electors that politicians agree: lying, deceiving or misleading has got to stop. The electors demand it, and I believe they certainly deserve a better deal than they are getting at the moment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be trite to say but I think it is vitally important that we remind ourselves that our democracy is a very precious thing. Our democracy provides the structure for our laws and the way that our society operates. For democracy to work, people have to have faith in the system and they have to have faith in the legislative framework that underpins our democratic system and our democratic structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore essential that we be eternally vigilant in dealing with the legislation that governs our democracy and our democratic practices and continually finetune the legislation to ensure that people retain faith in our democratic system. So each time amendments are made to the Commonwealth Electoral Act it is vitally important that we seriously consider the consequences of those amendments and ask ourselves the question as to whether or not they support community feeling and attitudes towards our democratic system of government. I wanted to make those few initial comments before addressing matters of particular concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first matter that I raise briefly is the issue of age discrimination, which has already been so ably mentioned by my colleague Senator Minchin.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With my involvement in elections and having been at polling booths to cast my vote, I nearly always recognise a familiar face from the town in which I live. A lot of the polling clerks and people who assist at election time enjoy the extra bit of money it provides. However, those people also provide to the democratic system a wealth of knowledge and experience gleaned over many years as polling clerks. Just to say, `You've now reached the age of 65; you are therefore disqualified from providing that service to the community,' seems to me to be very short-sighted. Indeed, it reflects adversely on those people who have made a very considerable contribution to ensuring that the system does work on polling day. That, once again, is an important aspect of ensuring that our democratic system works&mdash;that, when people go to cast their vote, the system actually does work. The best way to make sure it works is to ensure that you have people who have a wealth of experience and knowledge. Usually those who are over the age of 65 have been within the community for some considerable period of time and are able to assist others whom they know through recognising them as coming from their own township. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter I would raise is the issue of advertising in newspapers. Senator Minchin once again has made mention of the opposition's stance on that, and I simply would add my support to Senator Minchin's comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of prisoner voting is also a matter that I think needs to be addressed. Most people in this country, although they are very cynical about the democratic system and democratic structures, would join with Winston Churchill and others who have said, basically, that the democratic system is a bad system but it is the best. At the end of the day that is the sort of judgment we have to make. We have to ensure that people realise the importance of the democratic system and the role it plays within our societal structures. I therefore believe that if it is appropriate, because of criminal conviction, that you be disqualified from holding office within this parliament, it is equally appropriate that you be unable to vote until such time as you have served your sentence or your penalty. Once you have done that, of course, then you can seek to stand for office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the Australian Electoral Commission's concerns with the current legislation where it says that you are denied a vote if you are sentenced in relation to a crime or an offence which carries the potential of a five-year period of imprisonment. But, of course, just because that is the maximum penalty, the prison authorities do not necessarily know whether a person has been sentenced for a crime or an offence which carries such a potential tariff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party believes that all prisoners ought be allowed to vote. I think that undermines our democratic system, our democratic structure. If we as a community say, through the legal system, that somebody has misbehaved in such a gross way that their liberty should be taken away from them and they ought be locked up in gaol for a period of 12 months or more, then I think it also makes sense that we take away from them the liberty of the right to vote for that short period&mdash;more than 12 months or whatever it may be&mdash;they are incarcerated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party wanted to allow every prisoner to vote. We on this side raised a very effective community campaign, mainly through Senator Rod Kemp, the shadow minister for administrative services. As a result, the government said, `We will now amend to not allow prisoners to vote if they have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of five years or more.' What that has done is relax the situation from the potential maximum of five years. We on this side believe that the more appropriate line would be to reduce it to a period of 12 months imprisonment. I believe that there is a lot of strength in that argument and it clearly gained widespread community support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my former life I often appeared in the courts looking after people who had fallen foul of the criminal laws of my home state of Tasmania. I think I am recognised within my party as somebody who is largely sympathetic to the cause of rehabilitating prisoners rather than trying to seek revenge on them. Indeed, at the last state council of my party, I received adverse publicity from certain elements in the community because they thought I was a bit too soft on the issue of law enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is with those credentials that I say that I still support the opposition proposal and approach to this matter on the basis that, if a community says your liberty is to be denied you, then during that time your liberty is denied for 12 months or more you should also be denied the right to vote. When you are released into the community after that 12 months or more of imprisonment, your right to vote will be returned to you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main topic I wanted to talk about was the importance of getting some credibility back into the system of our democratic structures. I refer, of course, to the issue of truth in advertising. The comments I made at the outset of my speech are very salient to the issue of truth in advertising. Senator Lees has set out the statistics on the cynicism towards politicians&mdash;that it is largely believed that politicians do not tell the truth and so on. Senator Lees has made out a very strong argument for the need of the amendments she proposes. It is interesting to note that the amendment being proposed is in fact legislation introduced by the Labor Party to amend the legislation. When they then realised it might impact on them, they quickly moved to amend it and strike it out of the legislation. I hope it is returned into the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, people have to have faith within our democratic system and its structures if we are to retain the excellent free lifestyle we enjoy in this country. We are indeed the envy of the world in relation to the freedoms we personally enjoy and enjoy as a country. So it is vitally important that people retain faith within our system. People can go around this country&mdash;and I cannot say `lying' because that is unparliamentary; and seeing that we are dealing with the issue of truth in advertising I suppose the negative of `truth' is usually `lying', but in this case I will say `untruths'&mdash;telling untruths, such as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did during the last election. He said that if there were a Liberal government elected there would be a 15 per cent tax on everything. That was clearly untrue, clearly unsustainable, clearly not based on truth, clearly not based on fact, but it was hammered home time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that the government had that sort of campaign in mind when it moved to amend the electoral legislation to ensure that the requirement of truth in advertising would be removed. They told many untruths about the opposition's policies on health and industrial relations, and we have many examples of that. Recently, in the state of Queensland, the Labor Party embarked on a most outrageous campaign, saying that hospitals would be sold off and that you would need to show a credit card before you could be admitted to the public hospital system. There was no statement of policy which supported that claim. It was just a bland assertion which was clearly untrue and which had no basis in fact. There was no document which would have enabled them to say, `Look, here is the proof positive of this assertion.' It was just a straight-out untruth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home state of Tasmania, the people of Tasmania were assured two elections ago that the Labor leader, Michael Field, would do no deal with the Greens. A solemn promise was made that no deal would be made with the Greens. After the election result, Mr Field counted up the number of Labor and Green members and realised that the result would make a one-seat majority. So the promise that he writ in large letters was thrown out the window and he did his dirty little deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Tasmania did not forgive Mr Field. When that deal collapsed 18 months later, the Liberal Party was elected by a landslide. Whilst Labor has Michael Field as leader&mdash;I hope they continue to have him as leader in Tasmania&mdash;I am sure the Liberal Party will be returned. But for 18 months the people of Tasmania had a government that they did not want and that they were promised by Mr Field they would not have. The state was thrown into economic confusion and political confusion. There was uncertainty everywhere, and our economy suffered badly because of that. Until people can have some degree of faith that the promises politicians make before elections are going to be adhered to, they will lose faith in the system and therefore undermine our democratic structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of these broken promises is the Prime Minister's promises of tax cuts before the last election. Remember? He said, `These tax cuts are l-a-w, law.' After the election when he broke that promise, we on this side said, `That was an l-i-e.' The fact remains that the Australian Labor Party is the master of these sorts of campaigns. It promises one thing before the election and then it sneaks back into government and reneges on, or does the exact opposite of, that promise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator MacGibbon reminds us of Bob Hawke's promise that no child will live in poverty. The lies go on and on. The operatives within the Australian Labor Party are proud of the untruths they tell. Former Senator Graham Richardson, the powerbroker that got Paul Keating the prime ministership of this country, wrote a book bragging about the way he told untruths. He entitled his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whatever it takes</EMPHASIS>. It is not about morality, decency, integrity or honesty; it is about whatever it takes. If you have to do a bit of cheating on the side, if you have to do a bit of untruth telling on the side, if you have to do a bit of whatever it takes, it is okay because the ultimate goal is to win.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In winning at all costs, the Australian Labor Party has been undermining the very fabric and structure of our democratic system. We on this side of the house sincerely and genuinely believe in and support our democratic system. We do not want to see it continually undermined by operatives such as former Senator Richardson. We are more than willing to submit ourselves to the test of truth in advertising and of the truth of our promises because we have nothing to hide. We have nothing to be concerned about because we, as a matter of course, act on those sorts of principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad day when you have to actually write it into legislation to make sure that people tell the truth. But unfortunately that is required when you have operatives such as former Senator Richardson who ran his political life on the basis of `whatever it takes'. Senator Ray followed that up in recent times when he said that he was not concerned about fairness in politics; he was concerned about outcomes. I would like to think that we as leaders of the community are concerned about issues on a higher plane than simply winning at all costs. There are rules that ought to be abided by and there are appropriate standards of behaviour. The Australian Labor Party clearly shows that it cannot abide by them. Therefore, we join with the Democrats in supporting amendments which will require the Labor Party to be answerable to the people if it does not tell the truth in advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commenced my remarks by saying that it was absolutely important that we retain the confidence of the people in our democratic system and in our democratic structures. It is my submission to the Senate and to the Greens and Senator Harradine that the truth in advertising amendments will be a very big step in the right direction to show the people of Australia that at least we, as a combination of senators, see the importance of retaining standards and ensuring that people can have faith in our political system and our political structures. It will be interesting to see how the Australian Labor Party will vote on that proposed amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it two electoral amendment bills, including a bill for amendment of the referendum machinery provisions. The expectation on the opposition side was that both those bills would be debated cognately. That was the information we received in the months leading up to this debate. We learnt when the debate came on that we are going to deal only with the first of these bills. So I will confine my remarks to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use this opportunity to comment on the total inadequacy of the government to manage the program within the Senate. I have been here longer than anyone on this side of the chamber and I have never seen management worse than we have at present. We chronically run 40 or 50 bills behind schedule. There is no reason for it at all other than the inability of the government to run the program in the chamber. I say to the government that it is doing as good a job running the Senate as it is doing in the economy and with respect to employment in this country. They are all catastrophic. It is time it moved out and let someone in who can run this parliament and the country properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on a few points because the technical part of the bill has been covered exceptionally well by my colleagues Senator Minchin and Senator Abetz. I would like to deal with the general proposition as to the need to amend the Electoral Act. There is an increasing concern in the Australian community about the electoral process. Is it fair and accurate? Increasingly, there is a concern that the longer the Labor Party stays in power, the process by which it attains power is not fair and accurate. It is very much binding on the government to make sure that, like Caesar's wife, with respect to the process by which it acquires government, it is beyond dispute and suspicion in any way at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill that is before us deals with amendments to the schedules to the Electoral Act. There are a series of amendments to schedule 1. The first one that I would like to comment on is the arrangements in the bill for the supply of goods and services by the Australian Electoral Commission to any person or body. I think that is worthwhile. I would like to propose that the Australian Electoral Commission be expanded and conduct all the elections for the states in the Commonwealth. I do so as a consequence of recent experience with the Electoral Commission in Queensland, which was as amateurish a performance as I have seen anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It takes a fair bit of capital to establish and maintain an electoral commission when we have elections every three or four years. I think we should try to amortise those costs by using the commission more, even if it means a small incremental expenditure in order to get value out of it for the taxpayer. I can remember when there was great resistance in Queensland to having a common electoral roll for the State and the Commonwealth. I remember arguing with members of the state parliament at the time&mdash;this is going back 15 or 20 years&mdash;who almost had the view that the electoral roll as it related to their own electorate was their personal fiefdom. They felt they could exercise control of that electoral roll by maintaining a state electoral register. Queensland was one of the last states to go on to the Commonwealth electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I agree very much with what Senator Minchin said about the integrity of the rolls&mdash;and I will have a considerable amount to say about that when the next bill comes before the Senate&mdash;clearly, the Commonwealth roll, with all its defects, was a big improvement on what we were faced with in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A month or so ago, we had an election in Queensland. We saw the high farce which occurred with the Queensland Electoral Commission. There was very little security for the votes when they came in in their ballot boxes. A Liberal councillor who was acting as a scrutineer in one of the marginal electorates went to the counting place and found that the votes were unprotected and kept in the returning officer's garage. It was in the papers that many a vote was counted under the houses of the electorate returning officer. In one case in a marginal electorate the counting had to be held up for a day while a leaking hot water system which was under the house, presumably spraying water everywhere, was fixed. It meant that the count had to be suspended for 24 hours. This is comic opera stuff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a government is elected by a margin of 16 votes, as is the case with the present Queensland government, the electorate is entitled to know that the counting system has the maximum amount of integrity and professionalism. That is why I am in favour of one authority for the whole of the Commonwealth, if that can be brought about. I do not know if it can, but I would not think it was beyond the wit of the relevant state governments and the federal government to come to some agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite obviously, any government that was using that facility would need to have effective representation on the management. It would be desirable, of course, if we had common electoral laws. For the life of me, I cannot see why we cannot have precisely the same law for a state election as we have for a federal election. It is only a degree of parochialism that stands in the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rest of schedule 1 deals with deregistering voters, newspaper advertising, the printing of paper for ballot papers, getting rid of the watermark paper and using other secure printing, which they claim will provide some economic benefit for the taxpayer. It also deals with hospital polling, the counting of the Senate and the authorisation of posters. There is a proposition now that bumper stickers will carry the name and the authorisation of whoever authorises them in a party. I do not think that is a terribly important point because it is very hard to define that point. You get a whole range of bumper stickers in the community. Some of the more subtle political ones are often hard to identify as political advertising, but it is not a matter on which I am prepared to go to the barricades. The second schedule deals with the mechanics of the vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to turn to the amendment moved by the Democrats in relation to truth in advertising, because it is absolutely fundamental to the democratic electoral process that the parties do present themselves in an honest way to the electorate, otherwise there is simply no point in having a campaign. If the campaign is going to be an object of falsification by one or more parties, then there is no point in having that campaign. There are grounds for concern if we look at recent elections. It is, unfortunately, part of the ethos of the Labor Party that it has to win and win at any price and that the end justifies the means, and the end is the Lodge for the leader of the party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Abetz talked about the recent statement by Senator Robert Ray on that dreadful business where a candidate could not get preselection in Victoria for the Labor Party because he had a Greek name and another fellow from the trade union movement was selected in his place. While I have very great respect for Senator Robert Ray, he made the astonishing statement in public that he was not interested in fairness; it was outcomes that mattered. Outcomes are really what the Labor Party is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a different plane, we have a problem with the Australian community because expectations over the years have been raised to such a high level by promises of political parties at election campaigns. I think the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> has a quote from the author who received a book prize yesterday. This young man wrote a largely autobiographical book about his generation. He made the claim there that expectations have been raised to such a level that they are unfulfillable for the generation now entering the community and the work force and that there is a great deal of disappointment as a consequence of that. The political process has to accept part of the blame for that. When we hear claims made by Mr Hawke some years ago when he was Prime Minister that no child should live in poverty by 1990, that is a gross travesty of the truth and something we should not permit, as a responsible body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one sense I wonder why the ALP is opposing truth in advertising because it is a master of the whisper campaign. You only have to look at the last election where the three things that cost us the election were the GST, Medicare and the industrial relations policy. I know that in my own state, the union movement ran a violent and quite incorrect campaign with all the industrial employees in the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unions went and demanded, as they can under the industrial relations law, the right to meet workers in all the industries, who were all brainwashed with a very false presentation of what our industrial relations policy was in the last election. That did not require any expenditure of funds on public advertising at all, but it was very effectively used against us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same for the Medicare debate through the hospitals and through the community: at all avenues, you had people spreading a great deal of misinformation by word of mouth saying that we are going to abandon Medicare and all sorts of other nonsensical things. But over and above everything else, we had the great campaign run against the GST. In that there was not an element or shred of truth in anything that the Labor Party came up with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I wish to make a brief contribution on the topic of Taiwan and its acceptance or otherwise in the international community. Taiwan, or the Republic of China, has a population of some 21 million people and is an island nation. In recent decades, Taiwan has transformed itself from a primarily agriculturally based economy to a technologically advanced economic powerhouse. Its stores of foreign reserves of over $100 billion are the second highest in the world and represent, in great contradistinction, about the same sum that we are in debt. Moreover, with over $160 billion in annual foreign trade, it is the world's 14th largest trading nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1952 to 1987, Taiwan's economy grew at the rate of over nine per cent. Over the last five years, real gross national product has increased at an annual rate of more than six per cent. Taiwanese per capita income is nearly $12,000 per annum. Clearly, Taiwan is an economic powerhouse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taiwan is becoming more involved in international trade and monetary negotiations. Its recognition in that area is very well earned. Indeed, it has 130 economic, trade or diplomatic offices around the world. Non-government organisations such as Rotary, Lions and other bodies hold international conferences in Taiwan. They seem to recognise the role Taiwan plays within the international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taiwan has its own defence force, its own body politic and, of course, its own distinct economy, which I have just highlighted. It therefore seems appropriate that we as a world community provide such support to assist Taiwan in its integration into the mainstream world community. Having said that, I acknowledge that there are certain sensitivities and certain matters of pragmatism that need to be taken into account. However, I believe that it would be of assistance to the world community at large if avenues could be explored to integrate Taiwan further into the world community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although Taiwan currently is not a member of the United Nations, it ought be remembered that it was. It was expelled from the United Nations in 1971 not because it had done anything wrong or its activities were unacceptable to the world community, but because the United Nations was forced to make a decision between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, or the Republic of China. Basically, they both had the proposition: `It's one or the other. You cannot have us both.' That intransigence on both sides, I think, unfortunately worked to the detriment of an international resolution between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China and their general integration into the world community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Baume says, the population of Taiwan is 21 million people, a population greater than Australia's. It has been expelled from the United Nations not because of any atrocities, not because of anything that you might say makes it unfit to be a member of the United Nations, but simply because the United Nations was given a choice: it is either the People's Republic of China or the Republic of China, more commonly known as Taiwan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you were to put the human rights records of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China next to each other, if you were to put the level of democracy in those two countries, individual liberties and freedom, et cetera, next to each other, I think Taiwan would come out on top. I make the comment, just as an aside, that Taiwan has never engaged in testing nuclear bombs in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that Taiwan has not been fully integrated as it would like to have been. Part of the reason is that it has insisted that it was the government for all Chinese. That was difficult to maintain and sustain, given that the greater number of Chinese lived on the mainland of China in the People's Republic of China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the Taiwanese people are now adopting a more pragmatic approach and acknowledge that there might be two distinct governments looking after two sets of Chinese people&mdash;such as North and South Korea, North and South Vietnam and East and West Germany. There is, in my view, a lot of merit in pursuing an avenue which explores the possibility of us seeing whether a similar approach could be taken to integrating Taiwan further within the world community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was allowed to speak prior to Senator Baume, who kindly gave way to me because I have another commitment. I will not speak for much longer other than to say I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Free China Review</EMPHASIS> published in May 1995 entitled `In search of fairness'. It is an interview with the Republic of China's Foreign Minister, Fredrick Chien. I must say the developments that have taken place in Taiwan in recent times&mdash;democratic elections for President for next year, things of that nature&mdash;are all steps in the right direction. As a result, I believe it is worthy to explore the possibilities of assisting an outcome which could satisfy both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China to allow Taiwan to take its rightful and appropriate place in the world community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join Senator Abetz in hoping there may be some way of resolving this problem. Perhaps there is a role for Australia as an honest broker in this matter so that we end a situation where mainland China cannot apparently get on with Taiwan because the Republic of China still does, as I understand it, express some claims over mainland China.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to see that the Republic of China is now calling itself Taiwan in publications, which it would not do in the past. That seems to me to be the beginning of some kind of major concession. I find it dreadful that 21 million people should be disfranchised in front of the world forum of the United Nations, particularly, as Senator Abetz said, as they have not been guilty of doing anything and in fact are a significant and respected trading partner of Australia. I must say I hope this matter can be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do not think we can sit by and hope that as mainland China becomes more and more democratised as it is and much more a member of the world trading scene, it will adopt a more relaxed approach to Taiwan. There may well be a risk that as China becomes more of a competitor with Taiwan in a free market sense there may be greater commercial pressures for it not to accept the existence of Taiwan. In any event, it is a matter of great importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter I wish to deal with relates to an incredible and discriminatory decision taken by this government by way of regulation in respect to Austudy that unfairly and appallingly ill-treats small business people, self-employed people, the battlers who have suffered so much under this government. In discriminatory and disgraceful regulations that are still capable of being put aside by this parliament&mdash;but only until tomorrow&mdash;this government has tried to solve the serious problem of the rorting of Austudy by many people by hammering, grossly unfairly, those people who are not rorting the system at all but who just happen to be self-employed people, small business people, the people that this government has become almost infamous for ill-treating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What particularly disturbs me is that the government's justification for these atrocious and oppressive regulations does not reveal in any way the extent of the damage being done to self-employed people, small business people, throughout the country. In other words, what the government is setting out to do is right and proper and would have the total support of the opposition because it seeks to stop a lot of the rorting of Austudy. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Mr Free, said earlier this year when he introduced these regulations that they:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will focus the financial help provided by the taxpayer more sharply on those students most in need of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of AUSTUDY is to assist financially disadvantaged Australian students to complete secondary education and gain an initial tertiary qualification . . . Fine tuning of AUSTUDY not only shows the Government's commitment to helping those most in need of help, but also meets concerns in the community that benefits provided by the Australian taxpayer should go where they are intended.</PARA>
<PARA>Hear, hear! The release went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government had listened and responded to concerns that AUSTUDY income tests based on taxable income did not always reflect the whole picture of a family's financial situation.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt about that. I think it was a Senate committee in which Senator Tierney was involved that called for much better targeting of Austudy. Mr Free went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are more than 500,000 students receiving benefits this year; overwhelmingly, those who receive help are those for whom it is intended.</PARA>
<PARA>Now, let's get that straight. The great bulk of Austudy payments are for those `for whom it is intended'. Mr Free goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are, however, wealthy families whose taxation arrangements do not reflect the strength of their real financial position. When they receive benefits, others in the community voice concern.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say I would be one of those who would voice concern that taxpayers are being ripped off by people who have arranged their finances simply to take advantage of this kind of benefit. Mr Free goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under tighter targeting measures additional information will be sought from some students, particularly those with access to complex company or other financial structures, when they apply for help from the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA>We have already found out that it is only at the margin that there are problems and that additional information is sought from `some students', particularly those with `complex company or other financial structures'. The words sound quite reasonable. It is fact that the actions bear no relation to the words that I am worried about. In any event, Mr Free says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new income-testing measures will come into effect on 1 January 1996 and the expected savings to the Budget will be $13.5 million in 1995-96, rising to around $29 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the object of this exercise is not to provide Austudy benefits to other people in financial difficulties or lower income earners but to reduce the payments overall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly have no complaint about that except that there are many people at the margin who would rather see that money directed to others on low incomes. If the government is seeking to try to do what the opposition has continually called upon it to do, and that is to make certain that there is no waste in its expenditure&mdash;Senator Calvert is an expert in the study of this government's waste&mdash;this is an approach that should be endorsed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the object of this exercise is to stop many rich families, particularly those coming from overseas, from having assets and income overseas which is, in a sense, hidden from Australian authorities. So there are people with big houses, with multiple cars and so on, professing to be poor for income tax and Austudy purposes when, in fact, their assets are considerable. I commend one element of this tighter targeting. Mr Free says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . AUSTUDY will also be targeted to students who have a long term commitment to contribute to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA>that is, those who are non-Australians&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new provisions AUSTUDY will not be available to permanent residents who choose not to take out citizenship by the third anniversary of their entry into Australia as a permanent resident, or the grant of permanent resident status, whichever is the later.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that. People who come here who have permanent resident status should take out citizenship if they want to get the benefit of this kind of assistance paid for by Australian taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that what the government is doing is nothing of the sort in terms of limiting it only to people who are rich. In fact, it is revealed in regulation 12L that this hits almost every self-employed person, almost every small business, and it may well hit every employee who is involved in a superannuation fund. This is simply a mixture of pig-headedness, of a heavy-handed approach to small business and of monumental incompetence, because these are the people who no longer will be able just to have taxable income taken as the guide. They will have to put in great detail about their expenditure and savings in order to get entitlement to Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This regulation says that it will apply to anyone who has an interest in an asset located outside Australia. Now it does not say `a large asset'; it just says `an asset'&mdash;in other words, anyone who, for example, may have worked in the United Kingdom and had deductions for their retirement income taken out of their pay, which eventually they will become entitled to when they are 65. That is an asset located outside Australia even though they do not have access to it. So all people like that will now have to jump this new, additional, expensive hurdle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be anyone who has an interest in a proprietary company which is a little family company. It does not say `big' company; it does not say that it is a complex arrangement. So while Mr Free says that it is aimed at stopping those people `with access to complex company or other financial structures', what the regulation says is that anyone who has an interest&mdash;no matter how small, how minute, how inconsequential&mdash;in a proprietary company or an unlisted public company is now forced into this new, expensive and difficult test. It is also anyone who has an interest in a trust, anyone who derives income&mdash;not large amounts of income, but any income whatsoever&mdash;from a source outside Australia. It is anyone who is self-employed. I must say I am glad to see that the authoritarian bureaucrat who phrased this&mdash;and I hope the minister was not aware of the consequences of it&mdash;did at least exclude primary producers from this factor, but it is anyone who is a self-employed person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now self-employed persons, in so many instances in Australia, are those people who lost their jobs in the recession and had the determination and will to set up their own little businesses. Sometimes they are domestic cleaning businesses or they could be simply a gardening business, but it is anyone who is self-employed&mdash;and, of course, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said to them that this is as good as it gets. Anyone who is self-employed has to jump through this new hoop. Their taxable income is no longer to be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who is a partner in a partnership&mdash;a husband and wife partnership in, say, a domestic cleaning situation&mdash;is no longer entitled to the normal qualification arrangements for Austudy for their children. Have you ever heard of anything more oppressive, more nonsensical, more incompetent? I hope it is only incompetence. It would be very disappointing if it was malevolently aimed at the entrepreneurial spirit of small business. That is what it seems to be aimed at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to be aimed at hitting those people who are, if you like, off their backsides working to try to improve themselves. I agree that there must be better ways of determining Austudy entitlements than have taken place so far. But the fact is that the government has gone over the top in this matter. I do not know how much of the $13.5 million in the current financial year, or the $29 million to be saved next year, is to be saved at the expense of a husband and wife partnership or a self-employed person. Quite frankly, they seem to me to be the heart and soul of the spirit of individualism in Australia. They are the people this government is specifically targeting. The government is going to save money at the expense of these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In no instance does this say that there is any discretion to allow these people to have income regarded as the normal income test. There is no discretion. If you have an asset, or an investment in a proprietary company, or an interest of any kind, or you are self-employed, there are no exemptions. If you are a partner, there are no exemptions. And yet they say they are aimed at complex company or other financial structures. The gap between what we were told by the minister and the regulations presented to this parliament is an absolute disgrace!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no justification for any minister in this government presenting a statement of explanation which is so dramatically different from reality when it is presented to the parliament. I hope that the minister will reconsider, particularly the fact that so many superannuation funds are clearly the equivalent of trusts of various kinds, which may well mean that the great bulk of Australian workers are no longer entitled to have the normal entitlement to Austudy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the moment there are customers of Telstra who, for many years, have also been casualties of Telstra. For years they have experienced problems with dead lines, lines dropping out, busy signals when it was not busy and many more. They complained, even to the point of not paying their bills and having their phones cut off, which they desperately needed for their business, all in a desperate plea to Telecom to fix their lines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one member's case, there was acknowledgment of lines being physically removed, with Telecom officers stating that there was a prima facie case existing for conviction if the offender could be found. These were all once successful business people, with the type of business that relied on a telephone service fit for their purpose: a service they did not receive. Eleven years after their first complaints to Telstra, where are they now? They are acknowledged as the motivators of Telecom's customer complaints reforms. As a direct result, a telecommunications industry ombudsman has been set up and a complaints resolution process established. But, as individuals, they have been beaten both emotionally and financially through an 11-year battle with Telstra. Now their bankers have lost patience with their lengthy dispute settlement and they are going down fast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following an investigation of the initial settlement, accepted under duress, Austel, the industry watchdog, came out with a highly critical report of Telecom and the settlement was re-opened. The Austel report concluded that Telecom was less than a model corporate citizen&mdash;damning words for our nation's monopoly telecommunications provider which, at that stage, was entering a new period of competition. It recognised Telecom's failure to undertake preventative rather than corrective maintenance on its older analog equipment, some dating back 30 years, as a significant cause of persistent, intermittent faults and that Telecom had clearly put supply side efficiencies ahead of customer concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the admission by Telecom to Austel:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is of little or no bearing on the case that some of the testing has been purged from the system because we do not require these records to be convinced that this customer has serious concerns with her telephone service.</PARA>
<PARA>Backing up the Austel inquiry were critical reports by Coopers and Lybrand, describing Telecom complaints handling as not meeting the minimum requirements of `adequacy, reasonableness and fairness', and a technical review by Bell (Canada) of Telecom's testing and fault-finding techniques for network faults. Then followed the Federal Police investigation into Telecom's monitoring of COT case services. The Federal Police also found there was a prima facie case to institute proceedings against Telecom but the DPP, in a terse advice, recommended against proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this day the parties of the parliament have been denied any access to the Federal Police inquiry or advice from the DPP on the matter&mdash;despite persistent demands not only from the coalition but from the Democrats&mdash;or matters of the DPP wrongly advising the Federal Police that Telecom was protected by the shield of the Crown and that they could not execute a search warrant against Telecom in their investigations of alleged phone monitoring and tapping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the only relief COT members received was to become the catalyst for Telecom to introduce a revised privacy and protection policy. Despite the strong evidence against Telecom, they still received no justice at all. Meanwhile, COT members were still experiencing poor telephone services, their businesses were continuing to suffer and they had been forced to enter the exhausting and expensive process of involvement in all these major inquiries into Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Senate inquiry began to be mentioned by senators on this side and the Democrats. In late 1993, Senator Alston and I, at a meeting in Senator Alston's Parliament House offices, were given an assurance by senior Telecom officers that a Senate inquiry would not be necessary&mdash;that a fast track, non-legalistic process could be set up, that it would facilitate FOI access to Telecom's documents and that it would be all over by April 1994. That process was to be overseen by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. FOI documents from Telecom show that Telecom certainly did not want a Senate inquiry when they refer to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . walking away, but I do not believe this option would suit Telecom's wider strategy in that it would appear to lead directly to a Senate inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My course therefore is to force Gordon Hughes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the arbitrator&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to rule on our preferred rules of arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA>A fast track settlement proposal was signed by the four COT members in November 1993 and the fast track arbitration procedure on 24 April 1994, involving a confidentiality clause forbidding COT members any further public comment on Telecom. Even during this period of negotiations on the arbitration rules, FOI was being held up by Telecom. One Commonwealth Ombudsman's report on delays in FOI information condemns Telecom's denial of documents in the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was unreasonable for Telecom to require the participants to make further assurances while Telecom was considering the arbitration agreement and thereby denying participants the opportunity to consider the rules that Telecom wished to have included in the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator McMullan): is this fair play on the part of Telecom? The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no provision in the FOI Act which would permit Telecom to impose such conditions on applicants prior to granting access to documents&mdash;access under the FOI Act is public access.</PARA>
<PARA>These COT members have been forced to go to the Commonwealth Ombudsman to force Telecom to comply with the law. Not only were they being denied all necessary documents to mount their case against Telecom, causing much delay, but they were denied access to documents that could have influenced them when negotiating the arbitration rules, and even in whether to enter arbitration at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an arbitration process not only far exceeding the four-month period, but one which has become so legalistic that it has forced members to borrow hundreds of thousands just to take part in it. It has become a process far beyond the one represented when they agreed to enter into it, and one which professionals involved in the arbitration agree can never deliver as intended and never give them justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it was represented to members that it would be fast. It was called a `fast track arbitration process'. There were many documented assurances given to the COT members on timing and a quick resolution. The assurance was given by Telecom to the deputy Liberal Party Senate leader, Senator Alston, and to me, the leader of the National Party in the Senate, late in 1993 that it would be fast track and non-legalistic and would facilitate FOI documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the letter from Peter Bartlett, special counsel to the TIO, on 25 February 1994 saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The emphasis is on "fast track" resolution of these claims.</PARA>
<PARA>It stated also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this in mind the arbitration is likely to commence this week and will be completed at the shortest possible time frame.</PARA>
<PARA>There is the detailed timetable from the TIO scheduling the final report after four months. Then there have been the delays caused by Telecom's FOI documents. The Commonwealth Ombudsman has twice reviewed Telecom FOI delays and has been very critical of, in her words, `Telecom's defective administration'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been further delays, referred to by the ombudsman as `unreasonable', because Telecom sent FOI documents to be vetted by their lawyers before release to members, and delays caused by the destruction of documentation&mdash;in the case of the Tivoli Restaurant, all Telecom's raw data on testing from 1989 to July 1993. What this has meant is that the COT members, as Telecom has drip-fed their FOI, have had to resubmit their statements to the arbitrator to include the delayed information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give an example of the experience of COT member Ann Garms with FOI documents, she applied to Telecom for FOI in December 1993. In February she received approximately 10,000 documents. In April the arbitration procedure was signed; then in May 20,000 more documents turned up. From May to December 10,000 more documents were drip-fed, continuing till June this year&mdash;all for a process promised to be completed within four months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a situation of the might of a monopoly like Telecom, with all the resources behind it&mdash;said to add up already to millions of dollars&mdash;which has to be countered by four struggling business people. And now, despite assurances of fast track, which bankers and other supporters were reassured was the guiding principle of the arbitration, 18 months later the four suffering COT members are left with only one COT case settled and Telecom has made the non-legalistic arbitration process so legalistic that it has cost one COT member nearly $300,000 to answer Telecom's protracted process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many scathing reports of Telecom's defective behaviour by Austel, Coopers and Lybrand, the TIO and the Commonwealth Ombudsman. A second Commonwealth Ombudsman report is due out any day&mdash;with the first going so far as recommending compensation from Telecom for any costs unnecessarily incurred because of the defective administration by Telecom, which ironically now involves another costly mediation process for the COT members involved. The TIO, in his annual report, described the whole process as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . clearly the low water mark of effective customer relations, regulatory agency response and questionable direction from past management.</PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regrettable reliance on excessive legalism and failure to meet freedom of information requirements in a timely fashion has led in my view to an unnecessary prolongation of a process which was intended to be speedy.</PARA>
<PARA>The expense these COT members have been put to, arising from the so-called fast track arbitration process, has seen several go to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regard it as a grave matter that a government instrumentality like Telstra can give assurances to Senate leaders that it will fast track a process and then turn it into an expensive legalistic process, making a farce of the promise given to COT members and the inducement to go into arbitration. The process has failed these people and can never give them justice&mdash;a point confirmed by professionals deeply involved in the arbitration process itself and by the TIO's annual report, where conclusion is described as `if that is ever achievable'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The COT members would never have opted for arbitration had they known it would go on so long at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal and other expenses. Here are people who Telecom knows are on their knees, and the system becomes so legalistic that, to answer two Telecom requests for further particulars, it requires an additional $45,000. These people have had their lives ruined by the process that has followed from daring to take on Telecom. It does not stop there. Many people have lent COT members funds to see them through the process based on assurances given by Telecom to Senator Alston and I and written assurances from the TIO that disputes would be settled within months, also risking their houses and businesses because of the outrageous delays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom has treated the Parliament with contempt. No government monopoly should be allowed to trample over the rights of individual Australians, such as has happened here. It brings me no joy to bring this matter before the Senate. I would rather be here praising Telstra, an Australian icon. But they are not bigger than the Australian people and, through them, the parliament. Telecom has been highly criticised by many government watchdogs all through the process, yet sadly, it is the poor struggling Telstra customers who are having to bear the ultimate burden of financial ruin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, the Australian economy is now in the fifth consecutive year of economic growth. This long period of growth has been marked by low inflation and high employment creation. Can you, Minister, advise the Senate of how investment has been affected by these economic conditions? In particular, can you inform the Senate of two major investment decisions which were given some prominence in the media last week&mdash;namely, Cathay Pacific's investments, and the Hokushin Medium Density FibreBoard Plant in Tasmania?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important to look at investment performance in the Australian economy, because the performance of the investment indicator does indicate the underlying strength of the economy&mdash;and certainly a strength that those in the coalition would try to deny. For the year 1994-95, business investment in Australia rose by 16 per cent. Those of you in this chamber might recall that, on the eve of the budget that year, the shadow spokesman for the Treasury, Peter Costello, said that Labor's estimates would be dead in the water. Those estimates were 14.5 per cent in that budget; in that year we achieved 16 per cent, just to prove once again that the opposition is into trying to peddle bad news and undermining the strong economic performance of this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This level of investment reflected exceptionally strong growth of 21 per cent in plant and equipment investment last financial year&mdash;growth which was, I believe, significantly above the highest rates of growth previously recorded in the national accounts. That solid investment performance is set to continue. This financial year we anticipate a total of $54 billion of investment for all businesses across all sectors&mdash;that is $54 billion of new and upgraded productive capacity for the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a serious vote of confidence in our economic settings, and it means the creation of real and ongoing jobs for Australians. For example, Australia currently has $10.7 billion of major new resource projects in the pipeline&mdash;that is projects with a capital cost of over $200 million or more each, and they are either committed or under construction. Previously I have reported to this chamber the $200 billion of investment in the last year that the automotive industry has made in Australia and investment coming to other areas of manufacturing industry here as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About a fortnight ago another manufacturing investment was approved by the federal government. That was a decision by the Japanese company Hokushin Limited to establish a medium density fibreboard project at George Town, Tasmania. It is a particularly welcome investment for Tasmania because it is about adding value to our forest resources. One tonne of export woodchips earns about $80, but one tonne of export fibreboard will earn $600. That is an indication of a seven-fold increase because of the value adding chain that this investment will bring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project will involve a capital investment of $90 million, will result in the direct employment of 120 people and will produce export earnings of $70 million a year. This investment is a direct result of the federal government's investment attraction efforts in Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, in the services sector last week I was very pleased to announce that Cathay Pacific has decided to relocate its flight training centre to Australia from Hong Kong. That is an investment by Cathay in Australia of $110 million. It will employ 65 highly skilled staff. It will have a centre training 90 people a day. It follows Cathay's earlier decision to invest $250 million for a data centre and telecommunications hub in Sydney. It is a very impressive high technology centre. I opened that centre last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both these investments are current examples of the confidence the international investment community has in the Australian economy and its propensity to choose Australia as a regional headquarter in the Asia Pacific area for its operations.

Your government has continually justified the payment of Dr Lawrence's legal expenses on the basis that they are directed to her carrying out her functions as a minister and are therefore supported by section 4(4)(b) of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act. Yet, when we asked for the amount of the four bills so far rendered to the Commonwealth, Senator Evans refused, saying that they are subject to legal professional privilege which belongs to Dr Lawrence personally and can be waived only by her. If the payments are made to her for carrying out her functions as a minister, then the privilege is the Commonwealth's, since Dr Lawrence is acting as agent for the Commonwealth when carrying out her functions as a minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to Senator Collins, the former minister for communications. I refer to the lengthy dispute between Telstra and the Casualties of Telecom and Telecom's assurance in late November to Senator Alston and myself that a Senate inquiry was not necessary as an arbitration assessment process would be fast-tracked and non-legalistic, would efficiently deliver FOI and would be finished by April 1994. I ask the minister: what has Telstra spent before and after arbitration, including reports from Bell (Canada) and Coopers and Lybrand; arbitration fees; legal counsel for the TIO; Telecom's outside lawyers; the technical and accounting resource unit; costs associated with the Federal Police investigation and the DPP follow-up; mediator fees following the ombudsman's report; and all other related costs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot provide the detail that Senator Boswell has requested in respect of costs in respect of each one of these individual matters, but I will refer the detail of that question to the minister on notice to get a response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to costs, I did note that Telstra advised the Senate legislation committee&mdash;the estimates committee&mdash;in June this year that there were 18 Telstra staff working in either a full- or part-time capacity directly on what Telstra referred to as the difficult network fault cases, commonly referred to as the COT cases. Telstra estimated at that time that some 13.85 person years had been devoted to the task in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telstra further advised that the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, in his capacity as administrator of the arbitration process, incurred costs associated with legal accounting and expert advice amounting to over $800,000 over the last two financial years. Those costs were also met by Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That information I can give to Senator Boswell now. I will take the rest of that part of the question on notice. The COT cases, as they are called, have not been an admirable part of Telstra's history, unfortunately. The matter that Senator Boswell just referred to has been before Senate estimates committees and has been raised in questions here over a period of time. It has been a very prolonged case as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it might be useful to Senator Boswell, in terms of the comments I heard him make earlier today in the public interest debate in the chamber about the fact that there had been only one case settled, if I informed him of the situation currently. This is advice that the minister has received, I think, from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. Of the 16 cases, one has been completed, as Senator Boswell said in the Senate earlier today, and the award delivered. One case has been settled. Nine further cases are well advanced. Four have yet to lodge claims, and one claim has been withdrawn.</PARA>

Asian tastes also have an increasing presence in the Australian community. As I myself advised the Senate on previous occasions, a huge industry that has been sitting under our noses until quite recent years here in Australia has been to supply from within Australia the Asian tastes that are now part of our society here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that Australian companies with the assistance of this government are now taking advantage of that opportunity. Western foods, as I said, are popular, but Asian foods are now extremely popular in Australia. As the Prime Minister mentioned in Orange this morning, net imports of Asian food into Australia currently amount to $800 million a year. It is around a billion dollars a year. We currently import $6 million worth of rice crackers alone into Australia a year. Most of this particular food comes from one company, the Sakata baker company, which has been operating in Japan for 40 years.</PARA>

Why does the front for the Australian government office in Taiwan, the Australian Commerce and Industry Office, charge a fee of $A50 for a visitor visa when the government has an official policy of not charging tourists on short-term visits?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in countries to which Senator Parer refers&mdash;whether it is Taiwan, Japan or any other place where an agency agreement is in place&mdash;will obviously still be able to get their visas from Australian government agencies. In respect of Taiwan, I will take that aspect of it on notice and come back to you as to whether that $A50 is in fact being charged. My history with questions like this is that, quite often, they are based on a degree of misinformation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that, whether it is Japan or anywhere elsewhere else where the government has an official presence and migration has a presence, people still have direct access to the migration department. If they want to go elsewhere for convenience, if they want to use the agency arrangements&mdash;let us face it, those arrangements are in place for the convenience of people in areas, for instance, outside capital cities or in capital cities areas remote and removed from our migration facilities&mdash;then we obviously cannot impose limitations on charges in a country over which we do not have jurisdictions. We can control our own operations&mdash;and we do so&mdash;but we cannot control the operations of other countries or dictate the laws of other countries or agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that extent, even within Australia we have problems with migration agents, people who try to facilitate entry into this country. As a consequence, we have migration agent registration legislation. That legislation has been part of a process in this parliament, a process which is leading to amendments to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take into account that we are talking about agency arrangements which will bring the services closer to the people. Just a few weeks ago I announced, for instance, the implementation of agency arrangements in Italy which will mean that people now can get visas to Australia through agents in Milan and also agents in the south, in Messina&mdash;not having now to access our immigration offices in Rome. I have also, by the way, instructed our officers in the migration department there to travel up and down Italy to make sure they are more accessible to people in the regions. It is part of a program in government and immigration to make sure that access to our visa system is enhanced for particularly people who are removed and remote from migration facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the start, I will take the Taiwan aspect of the question on notice. When it comes to other countries, as I said to you, Senator Parer, we can dictate the charges of the migration officials, and we do so through regulations in this place, but when it comes to the private sector&mdash;the sector you are great supporters of unbridled deregulation thereof&mdash;it is much harder, particularly if those people are outside Australia.</PARA>

When the minister does verify that there is a $50 charge by the Australian government office in Taiwan, would he also find out, if the charges are based on cost recovery, how come there has been no reduction in the charges despite the fact that the number of visas issued has almost doubled over the last year? I also ask him, in respect of the agency agreements he has negotiated in Italy, what the charges will be for tourists coming here. It is all very well for him to say this is a private sector matter. When the government gives these licences to particular travel agents, it is giving them a benefit that is not available to other travel agents. Surely, if you have any commercial attributes whatsoever, you would negotiate an agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fundamental question here is whether Australia continues to have a visa system. Both sides of parliament agree that we should. What we need to do is find out, with that in place, how best to make it accessible to as wide a range of people as possible. That is why the visa agency arrangements are in place. When we fix on visa agency arrangements we do try to focus on those agents who have at the moment the largest share of the market so that we can, for instance, reach a larger proportion of people coming into Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those arrangements, as I say, we can control our prices. They are the prices that are regulated by this parliament. When it comes to outside, officially or unofficially, we find enough trouble being able to control that within Australia, Senator Parer. You know that. To be able to dictate that outside Australia is even more difficult. What can be an agreement quite often may not be what is reflected by the final processing cost.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Lees for her question. I have seen the newspaper reports that she refers to in her question. I must say this matter is entirely one for SOCOG, the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. Obviously, the federal government, while wishing to see as many Australians as possible attend the events at the games, is really not in a position to direct SOCOG on what is essentially a commercial decision by that body. The organising committee is a statutory authority established by the New South Wales parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the bid documents proposed a total of 5.5 million tickets for the Sydney games.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the nature of the weekend's media reports is somewhat affected by the fact that the seating capacity for many of the venues has not yet been determined. For example, the Olympic stadium could contain up to 110,000 seats. So it is really impossible at this time to be able to calculate accurately any division of tickets for any of the events that will be taking place at a venue like that.</PARA>

The federal government, for its part, has made a very significant contribution to the successful staging of the games through the provision of funding of facilities at Homebush Bay.

I know that the figures for New South Wales a few years ago showed that of about a million people who came through the public hospital system, 50 per cent were dealt with in less than 12 hours&mdash;certainly on day one&mdash;as matters of accident and emergency admissions. Another 49.5 per cent or so were dealt with as elective surgery within two or three weeks or up to six weeks, which nobody regards as any lengthy time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So if you take people on waiting lists but do not put in the factor of how long they have been on the waiting lists you can get some false figures in that area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have to say that, with the introduction of casemix and other factors of that sort between the Commonwealth and the states, there is a significant difference in the number of people waiting. In Victoria, the Minister for Health certainly claims that there has been a significant reduction in the number of people on waiting lists in that state. Certainly the Medicare funding has, as I said, provided extra funding over and above the agreements to assist state governments to reduce those waiting times for people on waiting lists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to know that in the past when we have tried to arrange for public patients to be treated in private hospitals surgeons have refused to cooperate under that arrangement to assist with reducing waiting lists. There are some examples where surgeons have assisted in that way. There are examples where surgeons have actively opposed any opportunity for public patients to be operated on in private hospitals. Again, I think those factors also need to be taken into account here.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Kernot asked Senator Gareth Evans a question on unpaid work and he promised to provide further information, which is now available. I seek leave to have the following reply incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The reply read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Ray&mdash;In Question Time on 19 September, Senator Kernot asked Senator Evans, as Leader of the Government in the Senate, a question about the Government's response to the proposal embodied in the Beijing Platform for Action about measuring the value of women's unpaid work. Senator Kernot related this to the Government's efforts to promote the Beijing Conference as a conference of commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I seek leave to have the following reply incorporated in Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women has provided the following answer to Senator Kernot's question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report of the House of Representatives Inquiry into the Equal Opportunity and Equal Status for Women in Australia in 1992 found that a major frustration for Australian women was that much of what they did, as unpaid work, was perceived to have little or no financial value and was therefore "invisible" or "not real work".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Estimates for the value of unpaid work are excluded from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in all developed countries in line with international standards for measuring GDP. A revised version of these international standards was published, the System of National Accounts 1993, which recommended that estimates of unpaid work be developed within the context of "satellite accounts" which provide supplementary information which can be used in conjunction with data in national accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) published a range of estimates of the value of unpaid household work based on data from the 1992 ABS Time Use Survey. The estimated value of unpaid, voluntary and community work by women and men is $227.8 billion, representing a figure equivalent to 58 per cent of GDP. Of this, women undertake 65 per cent of unpaid work, worth $139.4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The publication of the ABS's estimates was a milestone in acknowledging unpaid work as a significant element of the Australian economy. The ABS advises that its publication in 1993 of these estimates is a form of satellite accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a step in national accounting which few other countries have taken. Further steps in accounting for the value of unpaid work in the national accounts will depend on international developments to which Australia is an active contributor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next set of ABS estimates are expected to be released following the 1997 National Time Use survey.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of how this tallies with Australia's efforts to promote the Beijing Conference as a conference of commitments, it is important to understand what our proposal meant. The conference of commitments proposal asked countries to identify three or four key areas which impede women's path to equality and to identify specific and concrete domestic measures to address these areas. The Prime Minister announced Australia's commitments on 29 August in the following areas:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">work and family responsibilities;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">overseas aid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's commitments to the Beijing Conference were well founded, based as they were, on extensive national consultations. The Government will honour these commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These commitments are complementary to the Platform for Action. The Platform for Action is not likely to have far reaching implications for Australia which is one of the most advanced countries in the world when it comes to policies and programs for women. However, the Government, through the Office of the Status of Women, will examine the document carefully, once a formal version has been received, to determine its implications for future policy in this country.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subject to constitutional limitations on the coverage of state banking, banks are currently subject to the competitive conduct rules in the Trade Practices Act 1974. Banks which are outside the coverage of that act, due to constitutional limitations, will become subject to the competitive conduct rules from 21 July 1996 by reason of the competition reforms agreed between the Commonwealth and states at the Council of Australian Governments meeting of 11 April this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The competitive conduct rules are designed to foster competition in Australian markets by prohibiting anti-competitive conduct such as price fixing agreements, misuse of market power, exclusive dealing and resale price maintenance, and acquisitions which substantially lessen competition in a market. Enforcement of those rules will be the responsibility of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The great change that today heralds is in fact a reversal of Labor electoral strategy and policy strategy that has been in place for 13 years. The Keating doctrine and the Hawke doctrine was generally to make a whole bunch of promises during the campaign and then work up the policies after the election. In other words, tell the people something before the election and then announce the policies after the election. We saw a slight change to that strategy last time. Mr Keating brought in a tax policy which, because he was so concerned about his credibility on keeping promises, he put into l-a-w, law. But, of course, he reverted to type straight after the election and changed the l-a-w, law, and broke the promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing to note is that the coalition has stuck to a policy over the last 13 years&mdash;and, of course, it has not been very successful electorally&mdash;of launching its policies in ample time for the Australian people to read those policies, to understand them and to see how they would affect them. At the last election they did so. Based on the information provided to them&mdash;and some of it may have been misinformation, but we will not go into that debate because I do not want to cry over spilt milk&mdash;they decided that they would return the Keating Labor government.

The people of Australia I have spoken to&mdash;and I have spoken to an incredible number over the last few weeks&mdash;know about the policies of the Labor Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment, Sports and Territories (Senator Faulkner), to a question without notice asked by Senator Chamarette this day, relating to the appointment of a scientific assessment panel.</PARA>
<PARA>I was asking Senator Faulkner to confirm whether the Western Australian state Department of Conservation and Land Management had vetoed an appointment to a crucial scientific assessment panel and substituted their own scientist that was on a list that was amenable to them. The response that Senator Faulkner gave me was that he could not confirm it. I was uncertain as to whether that meant that he was not able to confirm or verify the matter of an appointment or whether he did not know about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, Senator Faulkner came over to me and told me that essentially he was not able to confirm or verify the matter because it was a matter for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and that he would try to get an answer for me as soon as possible. Both were true: he did not know the answer and he was going to have to get that answer from Prime Minister and Cabinet. I find that very disturbing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why doesn't the environment minister know about this crucial transaction? It is not very comforting to know that he has to ask Prime Minister and Cabinet to get that answer because he has staff on Prime Minister and Cabinet's forest task force. They should have consulted him or at least kept him advised of the significance of this matter. I appreciate that ministers cannot know everything; neither can senators. But it is extremely worrying that what is happening is out of his hands because of his role as environment minister. He obviously has no comprehension of how this particular transaction will impact on Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact will be of this kind: the brief of the panel is to assess whether or not the non-statutory zones, such as road, river and stream reserves in the Western Australian forests, fit the Commonwealth government's agreed criteria for comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve systems as outlined in the national forest policy, with the aim of gauging their appropriateness for inclusion in the reserve system. The problem with that is that those road, river and stream zones, aside from other non-statutory reserves of the forest estate, comprise some four per cent or 100,000 hectares of the forest estate and they will have a very big impact on any areas that are set aside by CALM. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the panel were to decide, as CALM is arguing, that these reserves have sufficient integrity to fulfil the Commonwealth criteria and hence be included in the government's arbitrary 15 per cent protection goal once the RFA process is complete, this will drastically reduce the amount of additional forest of more substantial reserve integrity that is unprotected under the current DFA process. So thousands of hectares of Western Australian old growth forest, and the bio-diversity and beauty of it which would otherwise be protected, will be left to the woodchippers, in order to comprise up to the 85 per cent to which they will have access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters are of great importance. It is of great concern that the minister was not aware that what has occurred in this panel that makes the decision is that CALM, which has a vested interest in the inclusion of those non-statutory reserves within the 15 per cent that the government has set aside to protect, has had the important role of vetoing a scientist who was the Commonwealth's choice and who was senior and respected in the CSIRO, and substituting an appointment of their own. This really poses the crucial question as to what sort of fairness there will be in any decision that that body is able to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very disappointed that the minister could not provide the answer. I certainly expect&mdash;and I am grateful that he has indicated he will give it&mdash;an answer that tells us what his plan is in response to that transaction. I also ask whether he has received notification of whether the forest task force has received a recommendation on this matter from the scientific advisory panel. </PARA>

<PARA>Health in this country is clearly in crisis. Today, in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, there is an article headed, `Hospitals' cash crisis'. Allow me to read one short paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Queen Elizabeth Hospital's chief executive officer, Mr Greg Bussell, warned it would have to turn away about 5000 patients in the next financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>What was Senator Crowley's response? `Numbers don't count.' I can assure Senator Crowley that each and every one of those 5,000 South Australians, from her home state, will believe that the numbers are important. Indeed, she deigned to call my question a stupid question. I can tell Senator Crowley that immediately after she gave her answer a general practitioner rang my office to tell my staff that his urgent cardiac patients have a waiting period of six to nine months. That is how stupid the proposition I put to her is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tried to highlight to Senator Crowley the very real, perilous state of the health system in this country. Whilst this is going on, the Minister for Human Services and Health, Carmen Lawrence, is fiddling around with other matters, rather than devoting herself to the important tasks which her portfolio requires of her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The numbers of Australians on waiting lists for our public hospitals ought to be something of everyday concern to the minister. She ought to have those figures at her fingertips, be working on them and showing us the strategy of how they have decreased during the 13 years of Labor. Of course, the numbers have increased during the 13 years of Labor. So it is convenient not to be able to tell us about the numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Crowley that the numbers are important. If she thinks that waiting for a period of six to nine months with important cardiac complaints is appropriate, let her say that time and time again, because the people of Australia will then come to realise exactly how woefully she is administering the health portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move on to the second question I asked, about the numbers who can no longer afford private health insurance. Allow me to show the Senate this graph. When Labor came into government 13 or so years ago, in 1983, over 60 per cent of Australians had private health insurance. Today, the figure is well below 40 per cent&mdash;a great record. Of course, it is no wonder the minister did not quite remember what the numbers were&mdash;temporary memory loss, like her senior colleague. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the record of the Labor government in health. As the number of people with private health insurance decreases, the demand on public resources increases. As a result, more and more people are unable to avail themselves of the public hospital system. But, once again, that issue was simply dismissed by the minister and seen as something of no concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said that the high mortality rate amongst the indigenous people was unacceptable. I fully agree with that. This government has had 13 years to address that problem. Senator Richardson tried to address it. Immediately after he made all of his promises, the policies were thrown away and he was told that he could not implement them. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that this government has not been addressing the fundamental issues of health policy in relation to waiting lists, private health insurance and the indigenous people of this country. The minister ought to get back to the real issues confronting this country. She and her predecessors have had 13 years to fix this problem. She has failed and failed dismally. All I can say is that I look forward to the time when a Howard government is able to address all those problems. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that is how good your policies are at the moment, Senator Carr. The policy on youth homelessness is such a disaster that virtually every agency in the country that has anything to do with it knows it is a disaster, knows that your government is out of touch and knows that your government will not listen to the concerns of youth.

Those two children, aged 11 and 13, were found in August, in the middle of a Sydney winter, sleeping in a park in western Sydney. As I said to a media person on that day: Australian children should play in parks; they should not be sleeping in them. The response from Ross Free is inadequate, but we do look forward to a more substantial response when Mr Free gets around to responding to that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one overwhelming thing that young people really want is a job. They want an economic environment where they can have a choice as to whether they go to TAFE, whether they go into some other form of training or whether they go to university. They want that to be affordable, but at the end of it all they want the opportunity of a job. I have to say, from speaking to the hundreds of young people I have spoken to right around this nation now&mdash;and it has been a privilege to do so and an absolute privilege to be the shadow minister for youth affairs&mdash;that the overwhelming feeling from the youth workers and the young people themselves is that the Working Nation programs, even though some of the schemes are doing some good because they are giving young people some opportunities, are designed to get people off the unemployment statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is obviously a very cynical response. I am sure Simon Crean's ultimate motivation is not simply to wangle the unemployment figures, but the reality is that that is how it is perceived. That is obviously the political motivation for spending millions of dollars on having Bill Hunter on television every night telling Australia that it is all okay. The fact is that Australia's unemployment crisis stays there, and the biggest impact is indeed on the youngest members of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The homeless crisis is something that impacts particularly hard on unemployed youth and, of course, youth who are in training schemes, attending a TAFE or attending a university. I have done some research to find out what the cost of housing is for young people and the impact of that on accommodation for young people. If you compare rental costs in 1983 with rental costs now for Sydney, in real terms, you will find the cost of renting a three-bedroom property in the metropolitan area has gone from an average of $182 a week to $240 a week. That is in real dollar terms; the figures have been adjusted for inflation. So there has been a 31 per cent increase in the price of rental accommodation in Sydney. For young people that is an enormous hike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What you then need to do, to see how affordable accommodation for young people is, is to ask what has happened to their wages in that time.

All I have heard is carping, that we have not delivered as quickly as we said we would, that there is too much money, that they are not real jobs, that traineeships are not being used properly, or that the program is too bureaucratic. Some of that criticism may be fair, although I do not think it is. However, the credibility of the opposition's criticism would be much more substantial if they would say what they would do with a $9 billion program over four years to help the long-term unemployed, particularly young unemployed. We are yet to hear one word in substance of what they would do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another area of policy, that of infrastructure&mdash;Senator Ian Macdonald spilt the beans, or should I say milk, all over the place on this&mdash;the opposition is promising everything. Their tactic is to hint that they will build all sorts of things, but in a way that means that if they should win an election they are not firmly committed and can withdraw from their commitment to the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line and other major infrastructure projects. That is what Senator Macdonald's discussion paper says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we are getting this same tactic in the area of youth unemployment. Instead of a policy paper, we have a magical mystery tour of a bus trip&mdash;with four or five coalition members of parliament driving from Sydney to Cairns saying, `This is what we want to do. This is how we show our sympathy.' But in all of that trip, in all the reporting of the press, there is not one suggestion of policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would you do with the $9 billion? I think I know what you would do with the $9 billion. You would cut it.

Any of those changes would probably cost well in excess of $1 billion of revenue forgone. Again, the tactic is, `Let it seep out there as though we are going to do all of those things. When we get down to the election, if we are able to win it, afterwards we will not do any of those things at all because we want to maintain the fiscal structure of the budget.'

Of course, that is precisely what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did with his silly throwaway line of `get a job'. He made implications and he categorised young people in a way which excluded them from the rest of our privileged society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really should say that I am pleased to see that Senator Campbell's recent fact and policy finding youth bus tour seems to have given the coalition a different, albeit belated, understanding of at least some of the attitudes of youth in this country. You would have to say, unlike Senator Schacht, that there has to be some value in attempting to find out what it is that young people are thinking. By making jibes, as the Prime Minister did, by adopting a stance which is sensitive to being criticised&mdash;which we all are in the business of being&mdash;by being over sensitive to criticism and by not being sensitive to the suggestions which young people are making, it perpetuates the problem rather than brings any sort of redress to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should, instead of dismissing this opportunity to comment on the matter, recognise that there are very serious issues which are facing young Australians. As Senator Campbell found out, many young Australians are cynical about the future. They want to dream; they want to create; and they want to succeed. They want to participate in Australia's future. By cutting them out of it, by categorising young people, by suggesting that they are not part of this reality is certainly exacerbating the problem and doing nothing towards resolving it. Young people are desperately seeking&mdash;and I mean desperately seeking&mdash;a vision under what are seemingly `directionless decision makers'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vision for Australia, which is beyond the Olympics and into the next millennium, the Australia which these very young Australians will inherit, is a destination that we do not know and we cannot know.

What sense of ownership can young people have in the future that is expressed in such a way? It is the social analysts and the hard-core economic rationalists of both sides of this chamber who have given weight, meaning and substance to the phrase `the lost generation'.

The Labor Party were quite keen to use young people and children to further their election campaigns all those years ago but did absolutely nothing about it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the government simply would not know the results of those surveys. Twenty-eight per cent of youth in my state of Queensland are unemployed. Getting a job when they finish their TAFE or university courses or their schooling is one of the great concerns that young people have&mdash;yet the Labor Party have no concern for that and have done nothing to address that. The number of unemployed has increased dramatically over the years. There are now 95,000 fewer under-25s in employment than there were in 1990. How is that for an indictment of the policies of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regional areas of Australia youth unemployment is tragically high. It really should not be. With the tourism industry up my way in the north and its potential to employ a lot of young people, you would think there would be very little unemployment. But unemployment in the north is tragically high. One of the reasons for that is that the tourism industry, which wants to expand to create new activities, simply cannot do it because of the activities of this government and the Queensland Labor government in stopping any sort of tourist activity or development in the north. Hundreds of jobs could be created for young people, but what does Labor do? They stop these activities as soon as they are proposed, relying on any number of fairly suspect grounds and a lot of confusion between the Commonwealth and the Queensland government over them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business in the north, I know, would like to employ more young people, but do you know what they are frightened of? Senator Schacht would not understand this. He thinks it is old-fashioned, tired and hackneyed to go out and talk to people. Obviously, he does not get out and talk to small businessmen, but I do. Small businessmen will tell you they would love to put on more people but they are frightened stiff that if they happen to make a mistake in the person they employ and want to get rid of them&mdash;because they have stolen some money, they just do not happen to be suitable or for some other reason&mdash;they cannot get rid of them or, if they do, it costs them a lot of money in either compensation or usually legal fees, time lost and that sort of thing. So there are opportunities there for small businesses to employ young people but they do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Youth suicide in regional areas is tragically high. Senator Patterson is going to talk about that. In the transport area this government acts against the interests of young people by putting up fuel prices all the time. What is worse, young people who can afford an old car to get to university have to pay 2c a litre more than others for their fuel as a result of this government's actions. And who buys the old bombs, the older cars? The students going to university and to TAFE college. This government penalises them an extra 2c for it. There is no public transport, no buses, in regional areas of Queensland. Senator Campbell and those on his trip learned all about this when they spoke to people.

It is an area, Senator Macdonald, which depends very much on its tourism and hospitality industries. In that region unemployment has halved in recent times and jobs growth has gone up by 16 per cent. In that region, as in 62 other regions around Australia, under this government's initiative, consultative committees have been established to greatly assist the development of employment and training opportunities for young people. What we are about is tackling unemployment by bringing together business; governments, including local government; educational institutions; unions; and community organisations&mdash;bringing them together to develop the ideas and programs which will increase our skills base and, hence, employment opportunities, particularly for young people. </PARA>

What is regrettable&mdash;and I think perhaps that word is not strong enough; what is deplorable is that more and more Australian parents are experiencing the extremity of grief, especially the parents of young males in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1990s there have been more deaths from suicides than from road accidents&mdash;and particularly for young males. It is probable that we have underestimated the number of suicides because it is argued that some of the deaths from those road accidents are, in fact, themselves suicides. Suicide in Australia is estimated to have increased by 10 per cent over each decade. This has been largely accounted for by the increase in youth suicides&mdash;in particular, young men between the ages of 15 and 24 years. We know that that is worse in rural Australia. A recent study found that in the 1960s the suicide rate for young males was 10 per 100,000 overall, and it was only five per 100,000 in small country towns. And what have we seen? We have seen a complete reversal of those figures. In 1991 the suicide rate for young males was 29 per 100,000 overall; in towns under 4,000 it was 60; and in towns of 4,000 to 25,000 it was 35. The WHO figures show that suicide rates for Australians aged between 15 and 24 have Australia as fifth among 27 industrialised countries for males and as seventh among industrialised countries for females.

In fact, I understand that is the only element of policy the liberals have announced to date on this issue. However, at the last election the liberals promised to abolish the youth bureau within the Department of Employment, Education and Training. In the last election the young Australians were not worth a bureau; now they are worth a ministry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many great sympathetic remarks were made by the coalition in this discussion. But not once did we hear any real commitment. Not once did we hear any real discussion of the very important commitment that is required in terms of what would a future liberal government do in the role of government responsibility. As I see it, that role essentially is to ensure that each individual in our society is able to fulfil their full potential. The liberal philosophy is somewhat different: that the free market should prevail and that all the impediments that face young Australians essentially should be ignored to the extent that they cannot really interfere with market forces, which should be the real distributor of resources within this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, the government's role is to intervene wherever necessary to ensure that there is breadth of opportunity and to ensure that the market does not leave people behind. Liberal Party policy, on the other hand, is for small government, the reliance on market forces and for the survival of the fittest. Again and again we have heard coalition spokesmen talk about the need for small government. As far as I am concerned, the approach that has been taken so far is to rely upon grand sentiment, but without the backing of that grand sentiment with any resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that the state can stay out of these issues, to suggest that the small government mentality should dominate, is effectively to say that the sons and the daughters of the wealthy and the privileged should get a much better go than the rest of the people in our society. To say to do nothing is in fact to discriminate in favour of the privileged.

There has been the closure of 300 schools. We have seen in the last state budget papers a further 32 schools targeted for closure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To students protesting against full fees, declining education funding and Austudy at below poverty line levels, the remark of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of `get a job' earlier this year was a sign of the government's true commitment to higher education. It was an ignorant remark because universities are more and more focused on employment outcomes for students and they are targeting their courses and curricula towards the job market. Much of the emphasis on humanities and social service has been lost to universities now in this last decade of economic rationalism. The social objectives of universities have been rendered subservient to the dominant values of the free market. Instead, universities are becoming centres for research, development and training for technocrats for multinational companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of students are at university with the intention of becoming more skilled and knowledgeable so that they can be more employable and get a job. However, it is getting increasingly difficult for students to gain access to university and to maintain themselves financially to stay there. Each year thousands of students miss out on places to university; yet the government is not interested in creating any new places unless industry funds them from tax subsidies, which only serves to provide more workers for narrow industry based courses. It is not about educating students in a broad range of subjects that will help them lead fulfilling lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a student is lucky to acquire a place at university, there is a myriad of obstacles to overcome in order to stay there and complete a degree. There is no parity between Austudy conditions and rates and DSS rates and conditions. Austudy has always been below the poverty line, but the rate is dropping compared with inflation and wages over the last 20 years. Prior to 1974, 55 per cent of full-time students received financial support. The level of support was 117 per cent of the unemployment benefits and 75 per cent of the poverty line. Today only 48 per cent of full-time students receive benefits, but they only receive 81 per cent of unemployment benefits set at only 57 per cent of the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once they graduate or finish studying, graduates are saddled with a debt for many years. Graduates no longer have a guaranteed level of income or employment. Age and gender markedly influence how much a graduate gets paid. The ability of students to repay HECS and/or supplementary loans is contingent on their income. On top of the financial burdens outlined is the threat of full fees for post-graduates, and this is a backward step. The fees are unchecked, as is the course quality, and this is a testing ground for the government to bring in fees for the undergraduate sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will have massive consequences for access and equity in tertiary education and will result in education for the privileged. The Prime Minister should think very carefully about devaluing education by calling on students to stop protesting and to `get a job'.

The reality is that the Working Nation policy, which has been brought in by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Simon Crean, has done almost nothing to affect that rate.

You may say that you have written to the editor. I would have taken Madam Acting Deputy President's ruling that it is perfectly reasonable for you to say that you are committed, but I do not think you have to convince us all, Senator Herron; we know it. But, if what you want to argue is that Senator Schacht misrepresented you, then I think you need to stick to that. We do not need to trawl through the substance of what is in that document.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the point of order: I think a very important principle is being debated here in relation to standing order 190. If what the minister argues is to be the case from an interpretation of that standing order, it means that a minister or any other person can get up and totally misrepresent&mdash;the minister was not here when Senator Schacht did that&mdash;what Senator Herron did or does in relation to the anal sex guide and misrepresent and impugn Senator Herron's integrity not only as a person but as a professional. The minister referred to him as someone with the behavioural codes of the 1800s. So he has attacked Senator Herron's entire personal integrity. If it is okay for the minister to do that, I am sure standing order 190 ensures that senators who have been so attacked and had their position misrepresented can make a proper explanation of that misrepresentation and not simply be limited to saying, `He was wrong and I'm right; he misrepresented me,' and then be required to sit down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this deserves fairness and decency. It should ensure that under standing order 190 Senator Herron can make a detailed explanation of why the minister was so wrong and misleading. In this sort of case there almost needs to be a fine or a penalty imposed upon someone in this place who seeks to do that. Part of that penalty for the Senate is to endure from Senator Herron the truth about those matters on this occasion. It may be painful for you, Senator Crowley, but I know you are a fair person because I have had the pleasure of knowing you for five years. In fairness, if you had heard what minister Schacht said about Senator Herron, you would feel that under standing order 190 he should make a quite detailed explanation about why that minister so misled the Senate and misrepresented Senator Herron. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might mention as well that I happily go on Triple J and have been on Triple J in relation to this matter in the past. So Senator Schacht was factually wrong in that regard. Triple J did quite an extensive interview with me, so perhaps I will refute that particular item. I shall be brief. I will read a letter to the editor of the magazine that published the government guide. It says:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having qualified in medicine and completing my surgical training (Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, Edinburgh and Australasia) I was the first research fellow of the Queensland Cancer Fund in the epidemiology of melanoma and spent 5 years on this project. Subsequently my specialties encompassed colo-rectal surgery and breast cancer. My epidemiological training taught me to question the scientific basis for broad assertions, particularly in relation to disease patterns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AIDS epidemic is an excellent case study in this regard and it has been alleged, for example, that H.I.V. in non-haemophiliacs, non I.V. drug using females may be associated with anal rather than vaginal intercourse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This may well explain why the incidence of AIDS in females in Australia is so low&mdash;for example, in Queensland in 1994 there was only one new case of AIDS reported.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, there have been two; there was one subsequently. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My questioning of the statistical basis of the assertions in your Sex Guide is an attempt to shed some light on this paradox.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have received an answer from the Department (enclosed) and I have checked the references given (also enclosed).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be extremely helpful if your journalist could reply to my queries as it may answer the seemly inexplicable behaviour of the HIV virus in Australian women. I agree that "addressing the whole AIDS issue is a matter of life and death".</PARA>
<PARA>That is the basis of my interest in this regard. It refutes the absolutely appalling attack on me by Senator Schacht. I am not interested in other aspects of it because when I checked the references that were given&mdash;and I have them here&mdash;from the department I found that there has been no survey done in Australia, despite the statement by the minister in the other chamber where she said it was between 10 and 15 per cent. She quoted literature reviews of Bruce Voller, Masters, Johnson, Cosmopolitan and Rosenthal, which was done among 35 homeless children in Melbourne. In reviewing the literature, there is no basis for that statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that I am getting on to that actual basis, but there are two points that I want to refute: firstly, that I am taking an entirely moral stand on it.

<PARA>There is an argument in this regard about the basis of this so-called guide, which I am happy to attack, but that was only part of the basis on which Senator Schacht attacked me. I do oppose it in two regards. But the reality of the matter is that there is no factual basis for the statements in this guide, which was funded by the government with $250,000 and another $20,000 was spent on evaluating it, which we are yet to see.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill. We seem to be also canvassing the issues in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2), which was until recently to have been debated cognately. Therefore, I would like to comment on a few of the matters raised both in that bill and by honourable senators in this second reading stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) was introduced in the House of Representatives, I had high hopes for it as, along with a raft of fairly straightforward, non-contentious changes, it was to allow prisoners sentenced to a term of five years or more to vote in federal elections. The right of prisoners to vote has been consistent government policy in recent years and has been recommended by successive joint standing committees on electoral matters. The government has since backflipped on this stance for reasons which are unclear and which show a total disregard for the civil liberties of prisoners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go into this issue further, I would like to affirm this bill for the many positive changes it will make. These changes include more flexible arrangements for the Electoral Commission to conduct reviews of the roll, positive changes to voting arrangements for carers and other provisions for overseas voters, enrolment by fax and postal votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the bill which we are debating at the moment there are also a number of straightforward changes to the act, such as the powers of delegation to the commission, objections to electoral enrolment, silent enrolment, the right to vote of divisional returning officers, security marks on ballot papers, canvassing at hospitals, the authorisation of campaign posters, and the important introduction of computerised scrutiny of the Senate vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am exceedingly puzzled as to why we are not debating the two bills cognately. I think it also surprised most of the previous speakers in this debate. In particular, Senator Minchin raised the issue of prisoners' entitlement to vote. That is a very substantive issue which I would like to comment on. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters of this parliament, and also of the 34th parliament, supported the right of prisoners to vote regardless of their sentence. It is a stance I have taken, coming from 10 years as a prison psychologist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very good reasons for this. The stripping of citizenship rights is a way of providing an additional penalty on somebody who goes to prison. Admittedly, some or maybe many prisoners would not be at all concerned about this, as they do not hold the political system in high regard, and for many of them that is quite understandable. However, for those who do care that their citizenship right, their franchise, has been stripped, while it would not necessarily be classified as a cruel and unusual punishment, it does represent an additional penalty to the punishment they are undergoing and, to their minds, could be regarded as a cruel political tactic to deprive them even further of any voice in the decision making of their country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Minchin was commenting on this I believe he was quite blatant in his disregard for the human rights of people who are within our prison system. As he said, they are serving sentences. They are paying the penalty that has been set down by courts for the offences they have committed. In many cases, the penalties imposed on them are not even intended to be prison sentences. The statistics in Western Australia show that in any one year 45 per cent of all prisoners are in prison for fine default alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite true that people who are serving very short sentences, usually of under 12 months, will not be penalised by the particular changes that are being proposed in the government's bill. Nevertheless, we do see a system that is operating in a punitive way on people. Encouragement is now being given to keeping a situation under which those who are in the prison system for longer than 12-months are totally unable to express a voice in terms of their own vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand, really, the reason for the change of heart of the government. This was supported by the majority of the electoral matters committee. It was opposed by the coalition, but it was supported by a majority of committee members. I was delighted to see it included in the original bill introduced into the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned before, the current Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommended the enfranchisement of prisoners and was acting in a similar manner to its predecessor. I was a strong supporter of that move on the committee. Until August this year, it seemed the government shared this belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988, the government introduced the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill. This bill recognised the voting rights of prisoners. Senator Robert Ray, the then minister for home affairs, said when introducing the bill in the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As honourable senators would be aware, a principal aim of modern criminal law is to rehabilitate offenders and orient them positively towards the society they will re-enter on their release. This process is assisted by a policy of encouraging prisoners to observe their civil and political responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>When the bill came to a vote in the Senate in 1989, this move was opposed by the Liberal Party and prisoners' right to vote was lost. Consistent with its previous stand, the government introduced the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) on 28 June this year, which again removed the exclusion of prisoners from enrolment and voting. Two and a half months later, the bill that we were to be debating today, which has been postponed, no longer has that provision. What has happened in the meantime? The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), when withdrawing the amendment in the other place, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We had reached agreement on this particular issue with the opposition and other parties. Unfortunately, that agreement has been reneged upon . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I ask: what agreement had been reached? The Greens (WA) were certainly not approached to reconfirm our stance on prisoners. If we had, I certainly would have provided it. It would be interesting to know whether the coalition or the Australian Democrats were approached by the government and whether they made any agreement over prisoner voting or, indeed, any other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government obviously has the numbers in the House of Representatives to pass the amendment. Unless the government received a commitment from the Australian Democrats that they would oppose this amendment, I cannot see how the government would think it would fail in the Senate. Anyway, the government has rarely been shy in forwarding in this chamber legislation which it knows a majority opposes. So what can it mean?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government is showing that its commitment to the prisoners' right to vote is so weak that it is easily reneged upon or that its actions are some kind of payback for a lost agreement that the government believed it had with the other parties. During the committee stage of this bill, I would like to ask the minister what exactly lay at the bottom of this sudden change. No substantive reason for such a major backflip in government policy has been given by the Minister for Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA>This week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> has an article which says why it is very important to recognise what is happening here. There is a grave danger that the stance on prisoners is being influenced by the fact that we are nearing an election. It is despicable&mdash;and I know that various people have named it as such&mdash;that the law and order auction is utilised by a political party prior to an election. There is an understanding that a popular way of arousing voter support is to come out with harder and harder stances in relation to the law and order issue. That is accompanied quite often by scare campaigns, on the part of major parties, on the prevalence of crime within communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 28 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> has a poll which I would like to draw the Senate's attention to. The `Bulletin Morgan Poll' section&mdash;which I know is avidly looked at by all members of political parties each week&mdash;tackled the topic that `Judges are not tough enough on criminals'. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Judges are too lenient when it comes to sentencing criminals, according to the majority of Australians surveyed in a special <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> Morgan poll.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 69% of Australians who say that judges are too lenient also claim that the offenders "just get a smack on the wrist", that "the sentence does not fit the crime", that "the sentences are not a deterrent" and that judges are "not tough enough, especially in rape and violent murder cases".</PARA>
<PARA>Other issues were canvassed. There was an analysis of the subject by voting intention, and that was very interesting. I will not draw that out at this time because it may be hard to visualise. The reality is that a large percentage of people who would vote for the ALP or the coalition expressed the view that judges are too lenient&mdash;the view was shared by 69 per cent of ALP voters; 75 per cent of coalition voters; 67 per cent of `other party' voters; and 60 per cent of `can't say' voters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the younger people are, the less likely they are to share that view. Similarly, the question of whether judges are reasonably fair was supported by 23 per cent of ALP voters, 20 per cent of coalition voters, 24 per cent of `other party' voters and 29 per cent of `can't say' voters. Again, looking at the age ranges, we find that the older people are, the more likely they are to have a tough view on judges. Younger people are more likely to admit that judges are reasonably fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very good research on this matter has been done by the Australian Institute of Criminology. It pointed out that the way in which people answer these polls is directly influenced by the degree of information and facts that they are given. In actuality, when people in the Australian community are questioned about appropriate penalties for particular crimes, they invariably express the view that the penalty is too harsh for the crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr David Indermaur, from the Australian Institute of Criminology, published research Australia wide on this. That was far more representative of community views than a poll could ever be. He demonstrated quite forcefully that, when people come in contact with our criminal justice system, they are appalled by its harshness, by its lack of understanding of human values and human situations and by the totally inappropriate severity of penalties. If what we are concerned about is restoring the community and making the community crime free, it is actually counterproductive to work in that way. That is the point I am making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Values that the community perceives as being electorally important are being allowed to interfere, in my view, with the legitimate course of decision making in this parliament. It is quite outrageous that six months ago we were saying that we will be progressive and allow the legitimacy of franchise for people in prison, except&mdash;and there was one exception&mdash;if they are in prison on the grounds of treachery. I think there is a good argument to say that people who are convicted of treachery may, as an appropriate component of their penalty, deserve disenfranchisement. However, we cannot argue that other people deserve disenfranchisement as a double jeopardy penalty for any crime they have committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twelve months ago we said that we were going to be progressive and now, as we are approaching an election, we are suddenly reneging on that&mdash;and that is not acceptable. I was asked whether prisoner action groups and councils for civil liberties knew that there was to be a marked step forward on the part of the government and the parliament by allowing voting rights for prisoners&mdash;were they aware that that was proposed, and are they aware that they have now lost it? My understanding is that they were not aware that they were about to gain that and neither presumably will they be aware that they are about to lose it. I assure people that I have every intention of letting councils for civil liberties, prisoner action groups and people who really want a just and fair society in Australia know that this is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge my colleagues in this place to reconsider what we are doing at this point. As Senator Minchin pointed out, prior to the Labor Party changing the policy so that anyone who had a potential sentence of more than five years was disqualified from voting, it actually had a policy that anyone with an actual sentence of 12 months should be disqualified from the right to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Senator Minchin's view, we are reverting to the Liberal Party standard, which is that anybody who has an actual sentence of 12 months should be disqualified from the right to vote. If what Senator Minchin also recommends is that we change the legislation so that a person with a potential sentence of 12 months should be disqualified from voting, we are really getting into a more regressive system than the Liberal Party was prepared to see in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the opposition to be aware that they will be taking a step back in time&mdash;even further back than their own party's position when they were prepared to disqualify people who had an actual sentence of 12 months. The Labor Party was not being all that progressive when it changed the legislation so that a potential sentence of five years disqualified people from voting. In that way, the Labor Party was allowing people who may have had an actual sentence of over 12 months to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a problem here in relation to justice and fairness, and it deserves the consideration of everybody in the Senate. Even if the issue does not come up in this bill&mdash;and it does not&mdash;I am letting my colleagues know that the problem will occur so they have a chance to think through their positions before the paired bill is debated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that what we do is seen to be just and fair, because there is an additional problem which does not carry all that much weight with me but it may carry some weight with people who have economic considerations. To actually find out who has a potential sentence of more than five years or who has an actual sentence of over 12 months is a bureaucratic nightmare. There need to be routine reports to the Electoral Commission from all the prisons around Australia to actually have people disqualified or allowed to vote. If we did what was the progressive and enlightened thing to do, it would not be a bureaucratic nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks with a serious call for people to address this problem and come to the debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) with fresh thoughts and put to rest some of the concerns that may have been aroused in the community about this regressive stance that has been taken.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its indulgence, for the right to carry on for the final seven minutes of the 20 minutes that I was accorded and was speaking to earlier in the day. I was talking about&mdash;and this probably will not help the state of mind and the weight of the iron on the soul of the minister at the table, the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley&mdash;the truth in advertising amendment which will be moved by the Democrats to this bill and which will be supported by the opposition. I was saying that we had many examples over the years of a lack of fidelity with respect to the truth in what the ALP had put up in the way of electoral policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was on the point of saying before we broke for lunch that the argument was even being taken further than that by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at the present time, because he was now attacking the concept of truth itself. He was saying that he was going beyond truth in advertising or anything like that and saying, in effect, that there was no such thing as absolute truth. He was using this in defence of one of his ministers in the other place. He was using the argument that everything really was a matter of memory, everyone had a different memory and a different recall, and by inference there was no such thing as accuracy in statements or in the recording of events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that a revolutionary concept and quite untenable. It is really defending the indefensible in relation to one of his ministers. It is an incredible piece of obfuscation, but it is an example of how the Labor Party have come so adrift with respect to the facts of a situation that they are now attacking the very fundamental concept of truth itself. I suppose that, if you have that point of view, it explains why the Prime Minister has just a bizarre view of history. Particularly, his views of Australian military history are quite at variance with the historical records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I want to return to the importance of this truth in advertising amendment that we are going to put into this bill, despite the protests of the Labor Party. We saw in the last election all the misinformation fed out about the goods and services tax that the Liberal Party was proposing. The Labor Party convinced the electorate that this would send them broke, that it would be an incredible impost. But, as I pointed out earlier in my speech, the facts of life are now that the Australian public is paying more in indirect taxes than it would have paid if the 15 per cent GST had been imposed and, at the same time, none of the stimulus and the benefits in reducing costs to industry have been passed on. In fact, the taxes that are imposed by this government are very much negative in their effect on business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the great statement of the Prime Minister, the l-a-w tax cuts, which have now disappeared like the Canberra fogs. So we have a long history of the Labor Party not coping with the truth very well at election time. The classical case and the case that is really motivating me to speak on this today was the Queensland state election where the Labor Party went far too far. They went so far in distorting the truth that they almost lost the election, because they neglected the old Churchillian dictum of `trust the electorate'. They tried to fob the electorate off with gross falsehoods with respect to what the opposition policy was and they almost lost the election as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The campaign was run by the member for Lilley, Mr Wayne Swan, who is a former state secretary of the Labor Party in Queensland, and Kevin Rudd, who is an ALP apparatchik in the state government and is now the candidate for Griffith. These people are known as the boys in suits by the Labor Party in Queensland and known as Ludwig's office boys to the community in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The boys in suits came up with the idea that they would frighten the electorate by saying that the Liberal and National parties would sell all the hospitals. They printed postcards and sent them around the electorates. On the postcards they had a picture of the local hospital with a slogan across it&mdash;`The Liberals are going to sell this hospital' or `The National Party is going to sell this hospital'. It was absolutely without foundation. It was really one of the significant reasons why the Labor Party did so badly in that campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very interesting, when the election was over, to see Premier Goss, in the great traditions of mateship of the Labor Party, apologise for this gross error in judgment&mdash;he said nothing about the morality of it, of course; and all the Labor Party walked away and left Mr Swan and Mr Kevin Rudd holding the baby and blamed them for the gross act of immorality that went on in the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did we have that; we had stories that the Liberal and National parties were going to log the national forest and that there was friction between the Liberal Party and the National Party. Most interestingly, many of the Labor candidates in Queensland never had the word `Labor' on their corflutes and their advertising material. They stood as `Bill Smith, your candidate for so and so' and ran away completely from any attribution or association with the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not much time left this afternoon to talk about the amendment that we will move to the bill, but it is absolutely fundamental for democracy in this country that there is a truth in advertising clause in the Commonwealth Electoral Act applying to campaign material. We can no longer tolerate the situation of the l-a-w tax cuts, of the distortion of our policies and all the other things that the Labor Party have gone on with for generations. If we could see the slightest sign that they were growing up and maturing and not being dishonest with our policies and with their own, then we might take a gentler view. But all we see is an increase in what is, quite simply, political immorality and, for that reason, we will be supporting the amendment to put truth into electoral material. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised at Senator Crowley's comments to Senator Chamarette and to my colleague from Tasmania earlier. I thought we were being very reasonable on this bill. We have pulled four people off the list. I thought you could have been a little more gracious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are speaking about the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995. It amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. This bill, like the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill that we debated in May, will affect the conduct of the next federal election. The speedy passage of the bill is important, we believe, because it will allow the AEC to prepare more fully for the conduct of the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate my support for this bill and note the coalition will be moving a number of amendments in the committee stage. I point out that, even though most of these reforms that are proposed in the bill are most welcome, they are really tinkering at the edges. What is needed in this country is fundamental electoral reform that will overhaul the whole system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This came to my attention particularly last year when I served on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters during its inquiry into the 1993 election. The committee produced a report. The coalition produced a minority report that recommended 40 fundamental changes to the whole system. We based this on evidence that we received right around Australia on some of the things that happened during that election and on some of the ways in which the Electoral Act clearly was not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the hearings with the AEC people they actually produced a little paper which had a look at 40 possible electoral reforms and all the reasons why they could not implement any of them. The Electoral Commission obviously wants to defend the system it has been administering for the last few years. There are glaring problems, obviously, with the integrity of the roll, but they seem very reluctant to undertake any major reforms. That is certainly what is needed in this country. Nevertheless, the reforms that are proposed in the bill are most welcome, even though they are not the root and branch reforms that have to follow on and will follow on once the coalition is elected to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electoral system that we have in this country and the whole Electoral Act which we are proposing to make minor reforms to today are based on two fundamental principles. One is access to the roll. The other is the integrity of the roll. What became clear during our hearings was the government's emphasis on access to the roll. I do not dispute that that is important. What has happened is that the integrity of the roll has been ignored in many ways in this process. I will go into a number of those as I develop my argument today. For the last 13 years the government has gradually reformed the act to make sure that it is much easier for people to get access to the roll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at a number of the glaring problems that were raised in evidence to the joint standing committee. I would like to go through a number of those. For example, there is no check on your ID at the two crucial points. The first is when you do enrol in a new electorate. The second is when you actually front up to vote. My daughter moved to a new electorate. It was a marginal electorate. I suggested that she enrol. I was absolutely amazed by her story. At no point did she have to produce her ID to prove who she was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What can happen with this process is that people can enrol in multiple seats. If we look at the seat of Macquarie in the Blue Mountains, there was obvious evidence of that. There were people who were enrolled there and whose address was a vacant block of land. They had enrolled right at the end, before the rolls closed. The electorate people did a check of these people. They actually checked over 2,000 sites in the Blue Mountains and they discovered 46 of them were vacant blocks of land. It is a bit cold in the Blue Mountains to live on a vacant block of land. Obviously, no-one lived there, but people were registered at these addresses so that they could vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is the way in which the AEC confirms enrolment. They just send out a letter to an address to check whether a person is there. If the letter does not come back, they assume that the address is correct. If there is no `return to sender', the person is put on the roll. What happens is that people in the know have friends enrol at their addresses. When that letter comes, they just throw it in the bin. It does not come back to the AEC; so it is assumed that the person is there. The person is enrolled. The person might live in an adjoining electorate and could live 100 kilometres away. They turn up on the day and vote in that marginal seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a bit of a problem, particularly in seats like Macquarie, which I mentioned, which was won by a majority of 167 votes. Page was won by 100 votes. Bass was won by 30 votes. It doesn't take many people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for that bit of information, Senator Calvert. He has just pointed out that there were 40,000 more voters than people actually on the roll. There are some other interesting stories about that as well. I have indicated that people have double voted. Certainly that occurs. The Electoral Commission admits that 6,000 people were identified as double voters in the last election. Let me put that in some sort of perspective. You had 1,500 votes decide the whole election, across 13 seats; yet 6,000 were unexplained double votes. How many were prosecuted? How many went to gaol for this? In the previous election, in 1990, about three went to gaol. There is this massive abuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government accentuates this problem by not providing the Electoral Commission with sufficient staff to do things like roll cleanses that might produce some improvements. They have actually cut the staff back, on average, from three to 2.1 per electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have this widespread rorting. We have problems with the integrity of the roll in Australia. When our committee suggested to the Electoral Commission that they undertake a major reform of the act, they refused to accept any of those arguments. We will have to wait for a Liberal government to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, the minor changes that are proposed to the act, as I mentioned earlier, are most welcome. There are 86. That sounds impressive, but most of them are non-controversial. They remove hyphens or they remove gender specific language. There are a number of other minor provisions. For example, personal details of silent electors are not to be disclosed to persons inspecting postal vote applications. Disallowing canvassing in and around hospitals that are polling places on election day is a welcome change. The bill also standardises the method of resolving ties in vote counts and allows changes to exempt from full authorisation requirements all letters to the editor items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It allows the AEC to use an up to date, secure method of security printing of ballot papers, to replace the more costly water mark method. I have some concerns about that. I would be really keen to see that the new system is more secure than the old system. Water marks, although costly, seem a very good way to go. As the whole thrust of what I have been saying is about what is wrong with the Electoral Act and is related to the integrity of the roll and the right votes being cast, I think that is something that should be looked at much more closely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to put forward our amendments to the bill because we still have a number of concerns. We believe the need to have full authorisation&mdash;stickers for cars seems impractical as they cannot be read. The provision to abolish the obligation of the AEC to advertise in two newspapers in states and territories is something we would question. There are in most states two papers that are widely read. Certainly that is the case in New South Wales. In the smaller states, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> is obviously a second paper you could use if you wanted consistency. We really believe the former provision there should stay in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned, we basically support this bill with foreshadowed amendments, as I have indicated. After we get into government, we intend to implement many of the findings of the minority report. We believe it is only through that we will get true electoral reform in Australia. We, and the Australian people, need to have confidence in the integrity of the system and have confidence that the result is fair dinkum and that the government we vote for is in the end the government that is elected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My concern about the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill is that it fails to address many electoral issues that the coalition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommended in their dissenting report on the 1993 election. There is no doubt there is still the capacity for electoral fraud. The government appears to be totally lacking in concern about that. I suppose one can impute motives, if one wishes to, and say a lack of enthusiasm about fixing up a situation where there is potential for fraud might well indicate that one may believe one benefits from that potential. The fact is the government has completely ignored the issue of electoral fraud and the system is wide open to abuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big question is: to what extent have we been able to establish that that abuse exists? I was angry after the 1993 election about a lot of things but one of the things I was particularly angry about was that I had direct mailed the electorate of Gilmore and a very large number of those envelopes were returned&mdash;`not known at this address', `left address' and a whole lot of other things. I referred all these to the Electoral Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There had been a general view in the past that this was all a great waste of time and that the Electoral Commissioner did not think resources should be employed to examine them. I must say I am glad the Electoral Commissioner did in this case examine the returned envelopes. All I have to remark, though, is that I thought the report by the AEC on the investigation of mail returned was precious, illogical, nonsensical and self-serving. Apart from that, it was terrific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mail-out I did was based on a return that came in on 7 February or so in 1993. In other words, the final electoral roll for the mid-March election was not made available until 22 February. In other words, the ones I sent out did not include what may well have been a last minute flood of people wanting to get onto the rolls for a whole range of reasons, some of them may well have been fraudulent. The fact is that the end January enrolment list I had probably did not cover those who may have been fraudulently seeking to change their address from a safe Labor seat, which happened to adjoin Gilmore, into this marginal seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of my problems. There has clearly, to my mind, been evidence of people moving their addresses from a safe Labor seat into a marginal seat for the purpose of influencing the result in a marginal seat. As I said, the list I had did not include such last minute attempts to do so, but there may have been other people in my list who had done that for that deceptive purpose. What intrigued me was that the investigation by the Electoral Commission concentrated on the fact that, because I had used the end January list rather than the 22 February list, the list somehow massively diminished the merit of my complaining that there had been a lot of people voting who had not received mail because they were not known at that address, yet they voted in that election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, I had sent them 1,400 names. In fact, after the commission deducted people who died and people who had subsequently changed between the two lists the commission still ended up with 1,058 names on the roll, mail to whom had been returned to my office&mdash;1,058 voters in one electorate could be very significant, indeed. I have an analysis here that the commission kindly did showing what that situation really represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 1,058, 224 did not vote at the election. As the AEC says, these are the ones most likely to be no longer living in the division of Gilmore. It sensibly concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These electors played no part in the result of the election.</PARA>
<PARA>They only represented 20 per cent of the returned envelopes. Eighty per cent of the people who did not collect their mail did in fact vote. Were they at those addresses or weren't they? I do not know. The AEC did not tell us. The AEC said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining 817 electors voted for Gilmore in this election. Of these, 608 cast an ordinary vote: 93% of these ordinary votes were cast in the same town as that for which the elector was enrolled, or in a nearby town.</PARA>
<PARA>The illogical conclusion that the AEC then drew was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the rural nature of this Division&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it happens to be right next door to Wollongong and has the town of Kiama in it, which is basically now a dormitory suburb of Wollongong&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">this would tend to indicate that these electors were still living at, or near, the address for which they appeared on the certified list for this election.</PARA>
<PARA>Bunkum! It may well also mean that people had travelled there from the nearby safe Labor seat of Throsby or Cunningham to vote at their phoney address where they are not known and if you send them mail it is returned. What an extraordinary conclusion, unless there is further work done by the AEC, of which there is no evidence here, that it had pursued these matters. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investigations have also shown that of these ordinary voters, 78 re-enrolled for another address in the February-May 1993 period&mdash;all but four of these re-enrolled within Gilmore.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that of the 608 who cast an ordinary vote, about 11 or 12 per cent remained within Gilmore and re-enrolled shortly after the election. The remaining 209 of these voters did not vote by ordinary means; they voted by declaration. In other words, 124 cast an absent vote, 36 cast a postal vote, 47 cast a pre-poll vote and 2 cast a provisional vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absent vote figure there is about 2 1/2 times the proportion of absent voting for the division as a whole. Surely that kind of high absentee vote should sound some kind of alarm bell because it clearly indicates that those people may well not have been at those addresses. It is certainly a much higher proportion than for other people within the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the real probability exists that people who did not live in the electorate&mdash;mail to whom was sent back to me `return to sender'&mdash;were able to vote in Gilmore and influence the result in a marginal seat. An examination by the AEC of the post office markings shows that, of all the envelopes that came back, something like 579, or 70 per cent, were returned `left address'. Of those, 70 per cent of the addressees were recorded as having voted by ordinary vote while the remainder had voted by declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AEC says that very few envelopes were returned stating that the elector was not known in the area&mdash;eight of which electors cast declaration votes and 55 ordinary votes. It intrigues me how someone can be `not known at this address' but known well enough to be on the electoral roll and turn up to vote. Of course, there are other reasons for people returning their envelopes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you have a post office box you may not want to get what appears to be junk mail. I must say that is an appalling description of a nice letter from me recommending how you should vote. If it is to be described as junk mail, it is very high quality junk mail. Of the 62 mailings unclaimed from the post office, it is possible that they could have been returned for that reason. Of them, 52 were marked `return to sender' rather than `unknown at this address'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That may have been the result of people not wanting to accept that kind of mailing. I do not know. All I do know is that there was a very large number of people who voted but who do not appear to have been at their recorded address and from whom mail was returned. The conclusion drawn by the AEC is interesting. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two points have become strongly evident from this study. Examination of the list of names from whom the party mailing was returned unclaimed in the election period has uncovered no evidence of organised fraudulent enrolment or voting:</PARA>
<PARA>That simply does not follow from anything that the AEC said. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the evidence examined has tended to reinforce a finding that the system is operating with integrity.</PARA>
<PARA>That is simply not so. For example, it does not deal with the question of multiple enrolments at one address, because I had not raised that matter. There is a fair prospect of multiple enrolments, particularly if people who really live outside the electorate have one address. It does not deal with the question of vacant allotments. I do not know if the AEC followed up to see whether these addresses were vacant allotments. All I know is that people whose mail was returned still voted in considerable numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something else that interested me in the AEC report is where it says that the volume of mail returned unclaimed was less than the number of persons likely to have changed address since the compilation of the end-December 1982 roll data which was apparently used for this bulk mailing. Naturally it would be, because most of the people who change address leave change of address notices with the post office. That is a most nonsensical comment from the AEC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is acceptable, normal procedure that you have a forwarding address for a while. The post office does that for a while. We are talking about changes of address in the last month or so. I cannot understand how the AEC could rationally have come to the conclusions they have come to in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes that it was not a close of roll influx. They sure weren't because I had used the earlier roll. It might be interesting next election to keep the overall mailing until the last minute when we get the latest enrolment list. What particularly annoys me about this inadequate AEC examination is this recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In future, the AEC not consider any undertaking to conduct investigations of this nature until both the original envelopes (or photocopies thereof) and a computer record of addressees from whom mail has been returned unclaimed have been provided.</PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, I provided all that. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The source of this computer record (extract form mailing data base, re-keyed list of names/addresses of mail returned unclaimed, etc) should be provided.</PARA>
<PARA>That conclusion is a pretty smart alec way of saying that because I used the end-January list it was massively incorrect and therefore it wasted its time. The fact remains that 1,058 letters were returned, leaving a tiny fraction of the database inactive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the AEC could not adequately demonstrate in this examination that there was no fraud, that people were not living in the electorate and were transferring their vote from where they did live in a safe Labor seat into this marginal area. One good idea was the recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the announcement of a general election or by-election, the AEC immediately advise all parties of the date on which close of roll data is likely to be available, and indicate the "lower return unclaimed" rate likely if the last roll data provided to relevant members/parties is used for election mailings.</PARA>
<PARA>Has the AEC ever heard of a forwarding address? According to this report it has not. It assumes that because people have changed their addresses letters will not be sent on to them. Because I do send out such mail, it would be handy for me to know when I should time my mail-out. It then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When updating an elector's enrolment, particularly where the elector moves to a new suburb, town or city, if no change has been advised to the old postal address the elector be asked to confirm that the old postal address should be retained, or to advise a new postal address.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not saying that this AEC report did not have any merit in it at all. It did; it resolved a few problems. The key thing is, though, that it did not resolve the essential problem of the extent to which there is a potential for electoral fraud. To pretend that that examination has demonstrated the integrity of the roll is just absolute self-evident, patent nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that the government is taking notice of such information when it determines that it should not close these loopholes. Maybe it is the bureaucratic advice on which the government is acting which has encouraged it not to close clear, evident, available opportunities for electoral fraud in a system that is clearly open to large-scale abuse. I would hope that that is the situation, that it is simply because the government has perhaps been in for far too long that it relies entirely on bureaucratic advice which may well not necessarily be what is in the best interests of Australians. It also, however, might be that allowing this potential for electoral fraud suits the government and, as a result, it is quite prepared not to close off these clear loopholes, which certainly should be closed off. I commend the amendments that the coalition is proposing to the government's legislation. </PARA>

Section 113 of the South Australian act makes it an offence to make inaccurate statements of fact. This is quite different from an offence of making an untrue statement. An offence that is confined to issues of fact is far easier to regulate than an offence requiring the definition of truth.

<PARA>I wish to speak briefly to amendment No. 2 standing in our name. This amendment refers to the issue of age discrimination within the Australian Electoral Commission. This has been prompted, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) said, by the concerns expressed to all of us, I think, by temporary staff of the Electoral Commission who work tirelessly on polling booths at election times, many of whom are elderly and retired and wish to keep up this sort of activity. As soon as they turn 65 they are told that, under the law, they are not allowed to work for the Australian Electoral Commission, and they lose the opportunity to participate in elections in the way they have done for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not believe that situation is acceptable. We have had discussions with the government about the problem of dealing with these issues on an agency by agency basis. We understand that the government does have, under active consideration, measures to remove age discrimination across the board. But, as I said in my second reading speech, those who have been around longer than I keep telling me that the government has been saying this for many years&mdash;and we still have not seen any action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, there was a letter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today from my colleague Senator Patterson reminding us that the Hawke government gave an undertaking in 1990 that it would remove age discrimination, and five years later we have seen nothing of that&mdash;another broken promise, something we are used to from the government. Of course, Senator Patterson was referring to the paradox in all of this: that Minister Lee, the minister for arts, said last week that he was considering amending the National Gallery Act to enable Mrs Betty Churcher to remain as director even though she had turned 65. So we do find the government's position on this less than convincing, given that for its own purposes it is considering making a specific amendment to overcome the problem of age discrimination inherent in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are advised that our amendment will deal with the problem of temporary staff. One of our amendments is to insert, after subsection 29(1), a new subsection (1A) which says that:</PARA>

Even though there may be cases of reduced mental capacity in some people in positions of social responsibility, ideally we should be able to trust both the government and community to recognise where appointments of people or of a person in particular would be inappropriate&mdash;not because of age but because of their inability for whatever reason to fulfil the functions they are appointed to carry out.</PARA></TALK.START>

Currently, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, there is a requirement to advertise in two newspapers that circulate widely throughout the state. Obviously, where there is only one newspaper circulating throughout the state, the AEC only advertises in that one newspaper. But we do believe that in the states of New South Wales and Victoria there is a problem with the government's propositions in that there are two major newspapers circulating in those states but they have very different circulations. It would be possible for the Electoral Commission to advertise in each of those states in the one newspaper which has very much smaller circulation than the other newspaper.

The reality is that print media is no longer the primary source of information for most of our constituents. Television, pay TV and the Internet now provide the bulk of news and information to Australian society.

Political parties, members of the House of Representatives and senators are all provided with electoral rolls now. Information as to gender is on the rolls which are held by the Electoral Commission. But, as a result of amendments some years ago, information relating to gender is suppressed. So, when we receive our print-outs, that information is not there. On the face of it, if you want to write to your electors, you do not know whether you are writing to a `Mr', a `Mrs', a `Ms' or whatever. We think that is a fairly silly sort of restriction.

A number of coalition speakers, including myself, indicated the reasons why we believe it is now appropriate for the Commonwealth Electoral Act to include such provisions. I said in my speech that in the ideal world one would hope that such legislation was not necessary and that the parties could conduct their affairs in campaign terms in a way that did not require such legislation. But I think the parliament does need to be aware that we have legislated to prohibit corporations from advertising in a way that is untrue and/or misleading to customers.

If a complaint is made to the electoral department it refers the matter to the DPP for investigations as to whether a prosecution should be brought. It was the case that in the last state election in South Australia that process occurred.

<PARA>This amendment relates to the qualification of prisoners for voting. I draw the attention of my colleagues to the history of this clause in the bill. The Electoral Act at the moment disqualifies from enrolment and voting any prisoner under sentence for an offence punishable for five years or longer. The act provides that controllers-general of prisons shall, on a monthly basis, provide the AEC with lists of such prisoners. This has constituted an enormous bureaucratic headache not only for the Australian Electoral Commission but presumably for all the controllers-general of prisons, because the basis for disqualification is the potential sentence for an offence and not the actual sentence imposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AEC in its submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters made the request for a change from potential sentence to actual sentence. This is one of the reasons they gave for the difficulty:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are just not in a position to recognise all the cases and court outcomes where the offence involved is one punishable by imprisonment for five years or longer. It is possible, for instance, for a person to be convicted of an offence carrying a maximum penalty of five years or longer in prison, with the court then imposing a much lesser penalty such as a bond, fine, probation, home detention, etc . . . other jurisdictions are experiencing the same difficulty [and are] furnishing monthly section 109 returns based on prison sentences of five years or more actually imposed.</PARA>
<PARA>You can see that that whole idea of a potential sentence makes it an actual nightmare for the prisons departments to actually track down the location of prisoners who have that offence. The AEC also suggested that that disqualification provision was potentially inequitable&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . because the exclusion from enrolment refers to a potential rather than an actual sentence, a person serving an actual sentence of one month could be excluded from enrolment, while a person on a sentence of 59 months could be eligible, depending on the potential maximum sentence in each case. Thus the present legislation takes no account of the Court's assessment of the seriousness of the offence.</PARA>
<PARA>The AEC submitted that the basis for disqualification should be an actual rather than potential sentence of five years or more. I might add, as somebody who has worked in the prison system, that keeping it as an actual sentence of five years or more will not lessen the bureaucratic nightmare of reporting on a monthly basis because, as people know, remission terms are different in every state and in almost every prison, for good behaviour, or for every individual prisoner. So a remission of one-third of the time or taking it back to three-quarters of the time also is going to cause a nightmare administratively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would have been very simple to have taken the very enlightened position that this committee took at this point. The majority&mdash;that was the Labor members and me&mdash;on the committee agreed that the existing legislation should be changed such that enrolment and voting rights be granted to all prisoners regardless of their sentence, with one exception, and that was for treachery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In support of the recommendation the committee argued that an offender once punished under the law should not incur the additional penalty of loss of franchise. We also noted that a principal aim of the modern criminal law is to rehabilitate offenders and orient them positively towards the society they will re-enter on their release. We considered that this process is assisted by a policy of encouraging offenders to observe their civil and political obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that it was not true altruism and progressiveness in total. In addition, to encourage prisoners to observe their civil obligations, the proposed change would be far simpler administratively than the existing arrangements. That was the position of the committee. Suddenly, as I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate, there was a change of heart or a change of mind by the government. They originally introduced a bill into the House of Representatives which removed that and allowed franchise for all prisoners regardless of sentence. In his speech on 29 August, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), said they had changed their mind. I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate that there seems to have been a bit of cross-issue petulance that led to the change. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We had reached agreement on this particular issue with the opposition and other parties. Unfortunately, that agreement has been reneged upon and we are now getting into the usual auction that we see in the community today on who is the toughest on crime. The proposition that the Electoral Commission put forward&mdash;that a crime with a sentence of five years be the appropriate provision&mdash;has now been changed to one year.</PARA>
<PARA>What he said next was extraordinary and illustrates the political nature of views in this regard. He was declaring, I believe, a conflict of interest. Maybe I should, too, because I am sure there are prisoners within the Western Australian prison system who may want to exercise their votes and who may want to vote for me. So I declare that right now and say that it is not just in order to gain their votes that I am pressing for these changes. In fact, if you think about it, for senators to resist the changes on the basis that it would deprive me of those votes would be a very ill-judged and unfortunate thing to do. To illustrate the potential political nature of this decision and to support my argument that we should go back to the more progressive, enlightened stance, I quote from this extraordinary paragraph in Mr Walker's speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find it a little difficult to speak on this issue, given that I was the minister responsible for the New South Wales Electoral Act for many years, which had a 12-month provision. My motives were purely political at the time. We did a survey of prisoners and discovered that 80 per cent of them wanted to vote Liberal if they had the opportunity. So, for pure political reasons we were never prepared to amend the act. There are other more altruistic people out in the community who wanted to rehabilitate prisoners, so we saw a five-year provision prevailing in most of the country. . .</PARA>
<PARA>And here I am going on to another salient point, which is that it is different in many states. He says that in Victoria, the ACT, the Northern Territory and federally, there are differences in who is allowed to vote. He makes the point that there are extremes. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In South Australia all prisoners vote. That is the one extreme. The real extreme is in Tasmania, where no prisoners vote, no matter what the sentence&mdash;whether it is a day for a parking fine or whatever, you do not vote. That is the hard line. I would have thought that is where we would have ended if I got into an auction today of one year, five years or whatever. We would have ended up with the Tasmanian position. However, that is not the case. The amendment that will be moved later is for 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA>My understanding is that all of this would be made a lot simpler if I could persuade my colleagues in the chamber to support the Greens' amendment, which would revert back to what I believe is the only position that can be justified on a civil liberties stance. It is totally unjust and it is totally arbitrary. We are not saying that once you have been in prison for a certain length of time, when you get out of prison you cannot vote. It is a distinct double punishment for people who happen to be in prison at the time of an election who actually want to vote. I urge people to rethink their position on it. I certainly urge support for my amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I place on record the coalition's complete opposition to the Greens' amendment. While we respect the integrity of the position adopted by Senator Chamarette, we believe she is completely out of touch with community sentiment on this issue. What her amendment seeks to do is to restore the government's original position, which was to allow all prisoners to vote, as is the case, I understand, in South Australia. In fact, I gather that is still the platform of the Labor Party. The Labor Party platform still says it wants all prisoners to vote, which we think is completely unacceptable and, as I say, quite out of touch with community sentiment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened was that, when the government announced that it was going to let all prisoners vote, the community reaction was just extraordinary. The fact is that people in Australia are very worried about the law and order issue. People generally think there is a problem with prisons and prison sentences. Most law-abiding Australians believe that if you commit a crime you should be punished and, when receiving your punishment&mdash;punishment meaning you are in prison&mdash;you should lose the rights and privileges of normal civil society and be denied the freedom of normal social intercourse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the rights that you should by definition lose if you commit a serious offence is the right to vote. The irony is that, under our compulsory voting laws, prisoners are compelled to vote unless they are disqualified by the current arrangements. In passing, may I say that I heard what the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) said about the law in New South Wales. I cannot believe that Mr Walker would do anything political, and I am sure that he was speaking tongue in cheek when he referred to a survey that he had done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about New South Wales law is important. We will be moving amendments to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) to provide that the trigger for disqualification be 12 months. One of the reasons we are doing that is to bring the Commonwealth law into line with the law in New South Wales, where half the prisoners in Australia reside. We think it makes a lot of sense for the New South Wales and Commonwealth laws to be similar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also note that the Commonwealth constitution states that there is a prohibition on anyone serving in this place who is also serving a sentence of 12 months or more. We think there are a lot of reasons for going the other way and making the law in the legislation a 12-month rule. I want to point out that the current law&mdash;the five-year cut off&mdash;affects only a tiny number of prisoners. The fact is that, under current law and even with our amendments, the overwhelming majority of prisoners in prison on election day will still be entitled to vote and will in fact be compelled to vote. Only 10 per cent of prisoners are serving a sentence of 12 months or more, so the proportion of prisoners serving sentences of five years or more must be absolutely minuscule. On those grounds, we believe that Senator Chamarette's amendment is inappropriate, should be opposed and is out of touch with community sentiment.</PARA>

I suppose in New South Wales during the Labor Party's reign the former Minister for Corrective Services, Rex Jackson, undoubtedly got donations for the Labor Party to allow people out of gaol. So chances are that those left in the gaols were those who refused to give donations to the Labor Party; undoubtedly, they were Liberal voters. </PARA>

I think the 12-month period we on this side are suggesting will somehow fall into line with the constitutional provisions. I think that makes sense.

This is an organisation which has the benefit of $1.5 million worth of taxpayers' funds. It is allegedly an organisation or a service to the public designed to provide timely information. It is clear from talking to journalists in the press gallery here that it is anything other than that and, in fact, is an active propaganda machine on behalf of the Australian Labor Party and this current government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, Senator Kemp and I have been pursuing the question of the National Media Liaison Service and have been successful in having Mr Epstein removed from being in charge of that service. It has in recent times lowered its profile, but people who have been following the debate on the National Media Liaison Service will know that we have been pursuing the issue of the National Media Liaison Service and its operations now for some considerable period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the Senate, there are estimates committee hearings which allow senators to question the allocation of funds and the functions of various areas of the Public Service as administered by the government. We on this side of the chamber have experienced all sorts of problems in trying to get to the truth of what the National Media Liaison Service gets up to. Both Senator Kemp and I have been very active in pursuing the issues during estimates hearings and have posed a lot of questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days, I have received certain answers to questions raised about the National Media Liaison Service. It is noteworthy that those questions were asked on 22 June 1995. It has taken nearly three months for these answers to come back from an organisation which allegedly provides timely information. The delay clearly is unacceptable, especially when one looks at the answers that were provided. As an example, I asked for a copy of the memorandum which gave rise to the Attorney-General's opinion on the status of Mr Epstein's employment, who was at that stage signing letters as the Director of both the Ministerial Media Group and the National Media Liaison Service. The answer we were provided was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Communication between solicitor and client is privileged.</PARA>
<PARA>It took us three months to get that information from an organisation which claims that part of its function is to provide timely information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to accept that answer, how on earth does the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, explain his willingness to provide Dr Griffith QC's opinion in relation to the payment of Dr Carmen Lawrence's legal costs? Who is the client in this case? It was not Mr Epstein. The client was the minister seeking information to ascertain the true status of Mr Epstein's employment. We are told that it has solicitor-client privilege, the government claiming within itself this sort of privilege. Seeing that the Leader of the Government in the Senate is prepared to release letters when it is of assistance to him, the opposite undoubtedly is true&mdash;that, when the letters are not of assistance, solicitor-client privilege is claimed. To get that seven-word answer it took three months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked another question in relation to Mr Epstein's activities and his continual denials that he was the Director of the National Media Liaison Service when he had, in fact, signed letters saying that he was the Director of the National Media Liaison Service. Indeed, one of those letters was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper, so he could not deny that he had written the letter. We happened to ask for a file copy of that. It took them three months to tell us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no copy of the letter in the files of the NMLS.</PARA>
<PARA>Three months!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to ask: why not? What is the state of the files within the National Media Liaison Service? Who is responsible for keeping those files? Is this a situation where certain evidence has been destroyed? Because another question was asked: `Are there any other letters signed by Mr Epstein as director of both the Ministerial Media Group and the National Media Liaison Service?' It took another three months for this answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No such letters have been located on the files of the National Media Liaison Service.</PARA>
<PARA>But it does not mean they have not been written, because we already have proof positive from the letter published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> that those sorts of letters were in fact written and signed by Mr Epstein as the director of the National Media Liaison Service. If that letter, which we know existed, is no longer around, one has to ask: what has happened to that letter as well as all the others?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Kemp asked for a copy of Mr Epstein's pay slip advice which Mr Epstein had shown to the media. That was of some particular importance to us. Let me remind the Senate that a lot of the material that Senator Kemp and I have been able to rely on has been a result of journalists, to use that term, leaking it to us to explain what the National Media Liaison Service gets up to. We knew that Mr Epstein had shown his pay slip to the media. We asked for a copy of that. The answer&mdash;and it took three months for this answer to be thought of and provided to us&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Epstein advises that Senator Kemp is in error as he did not show any such document to the Press Gallery.</PARA>
<PARA>We did not ask about the press gallery; we asked about the media. It could well have been a member of the media who is not part of the press gallery. Once again, we will have to ask further questions, dig further, dig deeper, to come up with the truth as to how the National Media Liaison Service has been operated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were very much of the view that Mr Epstein used to operate as both director of the ministerial media group and the National Media Liaison Service. Therefore, we asked for a copy of the cards that used to be printed for Mr Epstein at taxpayers' expense. I asked for a copy of all business cards that Mr Epstein had during his role with the National Media Liaison Service. One would expect that with the printing approval, the dockets, et cetera, there would have been a draft of the business card so that the printing people would know what to print. The answer&mdash;once again, it took three months&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No further material can be provided.</PARA>
<PARA>The simple fact is: no material has been provided whatsoever in relation to the business cards. It just seems somewhat incongruous that like the letters they cannot find&mdash;letters we know were actually written but they cannot find the carbon copies of&mdash;similarly for some reason all the records in relation to the business cards also seem to have disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp asked, for example, for a copy of any amended advice from the Attorney-General concerning the employment of Mr Epstein in light of the questions Senator Kemp had raised on the advice. The answer&mdash;once again, it took three months to get this answer&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister was not moved by Senator Kemp's questions to seek further advice.</PARA>
<PARA>Basically, it is all too embarrassing for the government and, therefore, the minister will not provide the information. Let me say to the government and the National Media Liaison Service that this issue will be further pursued at estimates. This lack of detail, failure to answer questions and obfuscation highlights the need for the new person in charge of the National Media Liaison Service to explain its terrible approach to reporting to the parliament and answering questions that were appropriately asked by Senator Kemp and me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday we had an urgency debate in relation to tailings dams associated with gold mining. In the course of that debate, Senator Campbell made some rather outrageous statements in relation to the `endlessly renewable nature of non-renewable resources' and accused me of being a fairy at the bottom of the garden. Among other things, he, by implication, accused the World Bank of being an even bigger fairy and the ABS, which has also estimated the value of resources in the ground, of being a fairy at the bottom of the garden. I will develop that as I go along.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I was making was that the two mines in question in New South Wales had claimed in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> interview that the gold would produce wealth of $250 million in one case and $100 million in the other. The point I was making was very simple&mdash;those resources have a value in the ground and estimating their value, once you have dug them up without taking off the capital value of those resources in the ground, is simply a trick of accounting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell is not stupid. Senator Campbell is either ignorant of basic accounting methods or he is being deliberately misleading. Every accountant knows that in a business you keep a capital account and a cash flow account. When you cash in part of your capital you do not show that as an increase in wealth; you show that as a transfer from capital to cash flow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Bank&mdash;and I think all senators will have seen this earlier in the week&mdash;has attempted to develop a system of national capital accounts. It has done so for the very good reason that unless you do keep account of those national assets, those non-renewable resources&mdash;the forests, the clean air, the water and all the other assets, as well as the human assets of education and health, which the World Bank counted, and the built environment assets&mdash;and put them down as capital value, you are totally misled in relation to the exploitation of those resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of those when you cash them in appears as if by magic in your cash flow account and you think you have become more wealthy, whereas all you have done is transferred wealth from one account to the other. I repeat again: the World Bank is carrying out this exercise. If Senator Campbell wants to call the World Bank a fairy at the bottom of the garden, let him do so. All I say is: some fairy, some garden!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non-renewable resources within the bounds of a country are exactly like wealth. A country which is rich in natural resources is rich compared with a country which has no natural resources. Non-renewable resources, the mineral resources, can be exploited once. They can be taken out of the ground. They can be cashed in, as it were, just like money in the bank. But once they are cashed in those resources are to longer there. That wealth has disappeared but you have the cash in hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point about sustainability is that you take into account what is called intergenerational equity. That wealth in the ground, which is owned by the whole country, is not only owned by the present generation; it is also owned by all future generations of Australia. Consequently, the principle of intergenerational equity means that you husband that wealth; you exploit it very slowly, recognising that it is non-renewable and also you should be very careful as to what exactly you spend it on when you do cash it in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was Amery Loven some years ago who drew a very nice analogy in this area. He said you do not develop a bank account by drawing money out of it. Yet that is precisely what we are doing when we mine non-renewable resources because non-renewable resources are just that; they are non-renewable. They are not, as Senator Campbell and others have tried to maintain, endlessly renewable. Once exploited, they cannot be exploited again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you take a tonne of coal out of the ground and you burn that coal, you cannot burn it again. You have burnt it once; it is gone. If you take metals out of the ground, such as gold, and you use those, certainly you can recycle the uses of those but you can never get 100 per cent recycling. The second law of thermodynamics tells you quite incontrovertibly that you cannot get 100 per cent recycling. There is a continual run down in those resources once they are exploited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of these resources in a proper accounting system should be shown exactly as a business does its accounting. When you exploit a capital asset such as a gold deposit in the ground, you show that as a shift of wealth from your capital account into your cash flow account. If you take $1,000 out of the bank, you are not more wealthy; you have simply converted it from capital to cash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would you take resources out of the ground? Senator Campbell was quite wrong yesterday. I am not opposed to mining. I am just saying that you need to do the accounting correctly and you need to be very judicious in the way you spend the money that you get from that non-renewable resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can spend the money, and that is exactly what this country has been doing. We set up a system of totally deregulated money markets and an enormous amount of our international debt is related simply to speculation in those foreign exchange markets. A lot of the wealth&mdash;I am talking about wealth, not cash&mdash;which is being exploited has simply been frittered away, it has been spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conversely, you might decide to invest that wealth. What you should be doing with those non-renewable resources is making sure that you reinvest that money in capital assets that will have long-term value. You must recognise that with the human built environment there is an aggressive deterioration of most of those assets, whereas natural assets, when they are in the ground, tend to actually appreciate in value over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the document that Senator Gareth Evans produced the other day, the ABS figures, which, I guess, Senator Campbell would say were produced by fairies at the bottom of the garden. The ABS has estimated the value of our non-renewable resources in the ground. The net present value of our subsoil assets is listed at $145 billion, a very interesting figure because, if it is right, it indicates that if we take all those resources out of the ground and cash them in they would not even pay the national debt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which is a great worry. However, the very important point I want to make here, which I also made yesterday, is that the ABS has estimated this value using a 7.5 per cent discount rate. In other words, it is saying that if we exploit those resources today, we might invest the money in the exploitation of some other resource, earn interest on that money and, in the process, increase our wealth, which is a false way of doing these sorts of sums.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bigger the discount rate, the more effectively you are discounting the future. You are saying that a resource 10 years hence at a 7.5 per cent discount rate has no value whatsoever. In fact, with respect to most of these non-renewable resources and, indeed, many of the resources which are not counted by the ABS as resources&mdash;natural environments, clean air, clean water and so on&mdash;actually appreciate in value because of the increasing scarcity of those resources. If you are going to do the sums correctly you should be putting in a negative discount rate with respect to many of those resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I have serious difficulty, not with the ABS attempting to do these sorts of sums&mdash;that is very creditable&mdash;but with the way in which it has attempted to carry out this study. By putting in discount rates they have almost guaranteed that they will come up with a silly answer. I am talking about doing proper accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Senator Campbell talked about the cleaning up of the spill in Guyana. I point out to him that the cost of cleaning up that spill goes down as an addition to the gross domestic product of Guyana.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to close because last month, only five days after confirming that it was going to provide funding for the financial year, the Carr state government broke yet another promise and withdraw its $1.35 million funding for the year. So the 31 full-time and 22 casual staff at the museum, which is the show piece of Australian mining and geology and has been for 120 years or so, will lose their jobs. The New South Wales Labor Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's assessment of the Earth Exchange is that it is poorly located, too small, too expensive and too specialised, and now faces terrific competition from other museums.</PARA>
<PARA>But the President of the Earth Exchange Museum Society, Mr Ray Beale, said that the museum attracted more than 100,000 visitors last year, a quarter of them students on formal education programs. I understand that many of the people visiting that museum are overseas visitors who are aware of the international status of this outstanding museum, which is part of our heritage but is now to be dismantled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Geological and Mining Museum, as it was originally known, started in the 1870s. It was revamped as the Earth Exchange Museum about 10 years ago by the Wran Labor government, which contributed $16.6 million to its $20 million refurbishment. At least the Wran government had some concern about Australia's heritage. The Carr Labor government clearly has no such concerns and this internationally renown resource is to be wiped out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that it has been an expensive hobby for people to go to this museum anyway because of the low level of state government subsidy. A family of four have to pay $27 for entry to this museum&mdash;which, by the way, is also supported by the private sector, particularly the mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the New South Wales Labor government intends to relocate the mineral display, including the world renowned Albert Chapman collection&mdash;which was bought for way under its market value for $1 million about five years ago&mdash;at the Australian Museum. But the Australian Museum is already massively overcrowded. It simply does not have the space or the resources to adequately display this outstanding collection. I am concerned in those circumstances that this historic collection may be split up&mdash;parts sold and spread around&mdash;because of the limit on space not only in the Australian Museum's display areas but also in its storage areas. It would be absolutely disgraceful if this collection were to be split up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, I hope that in the remaining nine days many more people in Sydney will go to look at these exhibitions. They can rock with an earthquake, walk through a volcano, see an underground mine, find out how to save dollars on their energy bills, enjoy Australia's finest collection of minerals, and join in the fun of the earth explorer adventure for kids. This hands-on program will run until the museum closes on 29 September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extraordinary that having survived for 120 years, including the Great Depression of the 1930s, apparently we can no longer afford this museum. Maybe it is true that people are worse off now, certainly in heritage terms, than people were then but it is extraordinary that, whereas all of the highly civilised and developed countries of the world have a quality museum devoted to the earth's mineral treasures, with special emphasis on unique and beautiful specimens, our only museum dedicated to showing the mineral treasures of our country, as well as other classic localities in the world, is now to be closed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was a boy, admission was free&mdash;that might be why I so often visited it&mdash;and there was a very strong educational value in its mineral display. The Chapman collection, which I referred to earlier, is the result of a lifetime of work by a talented and dedicated individual, who was famous among mineral collectors the world over. Mineral collectors from all nations have been coming to Sydney to see and admire this collection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minerals on display can simply never be replaced. In most cases, they are the best examples of their kind ever found. They are rare and formed under unique conditions in nature. Such specimens simply cannot be reproduced artificially or found elsewhere. Surely there is a need to preserve our mineral heritage, and it should not be destroyed by a decision of one ill-informed government. This is really part of our heritage, including the building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am wondering whether the state government has another agenda here and whether, because this building is at the Rocks and in the centre of the tourism area, it might want to use it or lease it or sell it for some expensive tourist proposition&mdash;restaurants or a hotel or something like that&mdash;due to its location. I would have hoped that other factors than financial ones might have encouraged the state Labor government to have been concerned about its heritage, particularly as some of these specimens do need careful handling. Many are extremely fragile and delicate and must be protected from handling, particularly by inexperienced people. Even moving them around can be dangerous. Every time such specimens are relocated, they are subject to the danger of being damaged. The collection certainly, as I said earlier, needs to remain intact in recognition of Chapman's efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, some other famous collections over the years have been split up and are certainly unavailable for regular visit. I must say that I am not quite certain what has happened to the old Bureau of Mineral Resources display. Many years ago, I worked in the department of national development. That BMR display was important and, to my knowledge, is not readily available to be seen at the moment. I think it was dedicated to some other part of the Commonwealth government. It may well, in fact, even be with the National Museum, which the federal Labor government now does not appear to be proceeding with despite, once again, a whole series of promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this Earth Exchange Museum is not to close until 29 September, a friend of mine has indicated that some of the specimens in the collection are no longer on show, and he wonders whether they have disappeared. For example, there is some scheelite from Nundle in New South Wales and there is scheelite from Wolfram Camp in North Queensland which he had seen on display before and which is not there now. It does seem that such a far-reaching decision to close this part of our heritage was taken on very short notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the way, another comment made by my friend was that historic photographs of the Chapmans already seemed to have been removed from the display area when he was there. The display area is to be used for some kind of function, and I do not know to what extent that puts these things at risk either. The fact is that Australians do rely on governments to protect such rare and beautiful assets, and this government is letting Australia down.</PARA>

Food was kept from the rural poor, and those who dared to try to make it to the cities were soon forcibly removed and left to starve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I came into the chamber earlier this evening with the intention of speaking in the adjournment debate in response to some matters referred to by Senator Chris Schacht, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, who took the government's lead role in the matter of public importance debate this afternoon. However, I must say that when I came in here Senator Coulter leapt to his feet and started to suggest that I was not stupid, but I might be ignorant. As Forrest Gump says, `Stupid is as stupid does.' I do not claim to be particularly bright or anything else, but I do not think I am stupid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is that I understand, from my relatively short time in this place, that if you are going, to use the colloquial term, to `drop a bucket on someone', or make the sorts of comments that Senator Coulter made tonight, it is polite to at least inform the person who is going to be referred to in such an exchange. You should do so to provide an opportunity for the other senator to either respond on that evening or at least to tune in so that that senator might have the chance to do so at a convenient time. I would suggest to Senator Coulter that I would have appreciated that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not detract from the importance of the debate that he has raised in relation to a sensible way of accounting for the value of natural resources, be they renewable or non-renewable resources&mdash;be they things such as clean air, clean water or virgin forests. For example, although I disagree with much of the methodology of what Senator Coulter put forward in his contribution to this debate here tonight, I do in broad principle agree that if there is a way of placing sensible values on things such as those natural resources then they will be more properly used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think in a way, even though Senator Coulter may not admit it, he is supporting the concept of applying some free market principles to nature conservation. Only when you bring in some more sensible market orientated economics to manage natural resources will you get more sensible outcomes, which will ensure a balanced use of those natural resources for economic development and the benefits they provide to this generation, both in the conservation that those resources can produce in terms of climate&mdash;and Senator Chamarette has just raised a very fascinating example tonight&mdash;and also for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to that section of the debate, I stand by the comments I made about the tailings dam catastrophe at Northparkes and the valuation of the assets. Clearly, any sort of assessment of the value of a commodity such as gold, any other commodity such as uranium and iron ore or any other precious mineral or natural resource under the ground depends entirely on the cost of extracting that resource from time to time and the value of that resource in the world market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, it is very hard to place any sort of estimate on the value of minerals and resources in the ground unless you have a complete knowledge of what is in the ground. If a massive resource that can be recovered at low cost is suddenly discovered, that will affect the supply of that mineral, whether or not that mineral is precious, the value of it and therefore the value of it in the ground, let alone the cost of extracting it. So I am still a little bit wary about Senator Coulter's valuation methods. Nonetheless, I think there is great merit in this debate. But I encourage Senator Coulter to ensure that, when he wants to have this debate, he at least lets the other participant in it know that it is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to get back to the subject that I came into the chamber to debate, and that was to refute a numbers of matters that Senator Schacht raised during this afternoon's debate on youth issues. I think it was Senator Reynolds, as Acting Deputy President, who, with I think the guidance of a clerk, quite correctly ruled on my use of standing order 191 to correct a number of matters. Indeed, that advice and the Acting Deputy President's ruling were quite correct in that I was not correcting matters that I had said but correcting what the minister had said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to get back to the points I was making. During that debate Senator Schacht said that I was not prepared to go on Triple J and defend Senator Herron's comments and his attack on the quite sordid piece on anal sex contained in the infamous <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cleo</EMPHASIS> sex guide. On a number of occasions in front of the national press I have not only defended Senator John Herron's attack on that guide but indeed encouraged him to go further. I am quite proud that I have distributed across Western Australia petitions condemning the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) for putting her name to that guide and further condemning her for spending scarce taxpayers' funds on distributing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the people who think that the Liberal Party is, by taking this attitude, against sex education tend to think that we are sort of prudish or something. I would always bow to Senator Herron's advice on the people in the high risk category of getting sexually transmitted diseases. Earlier this evening Senator Herron referred to a survey that had been done relating to some homeless kids in Melbourne. The statistics in relation to anal sex were very high amongst that survey's target group of something like 35 homeless kids in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the youth bus tour, which I undertook a couple of weeks ago, I heard some horrendous tales about sexual intimidation that takes place amongst that sector of our society&mdash;that is, kids who are on the streets and who are desperate for money, food and shelter&mdash;and the way that many children in Australia are prostituting themselves for their basic needs of life. That is a target group that certainly needs sex education, but I must tell the minister that those kids do not have the money to buy <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cleo</EMPHASIS> and many of the target audience in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cleo</EMPHASIS> are, I suspect, not the sort of people who need to know about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I raise in the few seconds I have left is that the minister said that we chose to run the tour through marginal seats. The reality of the matter is that I do not know what the margins are in many of the seats that I visited, but I am informed that, if you take a bus from Sydney to Cairns, it is virtually impossible not to drive through an enormous number of marginal seats. Indeed, to put pay to the minister's attack that the tour was in marginal seats, I remind him that the tour kicked off in Wentworth, which is a safe Liberal seat. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Barry E Arnold and Sons (BAS) have held several export licences since December 1991, some of which were not used either in part or total and were replaced by new licences. A breakdown of BAS, licences is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1991&mdash;MEPWOOD 698 issued for 60,000 tonnes</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) In 1993 BAS shipped 63,000 tonnes of woodchips. In 1994 BAS shipped 101,000 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) While the Department of Primary Industries and Energy receives locations of properties on which operations may take place, these do not generally quantify the net area subject to such operations, nor do they detail treatment of the land following the operations. In some cases the operations are used as a tool to `clear' land for future agricultural purposes, but in other cases the land is not `cleared'. For example, it is either selectively logged (and thus remains forest) or regenerated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given this and the variety of sources from which BAS sources woodchips such as sawmill residues, thinnings, logging residues and salvage operations, it would be difficult to attempt to calculate the exact areas `cleared' as a result of BAS' operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The export licences previously held by BAS contained conditions which are similar to all other exporters including requirements relating to forest practices. Additionally, export licences granted to Tasmanian exporters include conditions reflecting agreements between the Commonwealth and Tasmania on forest issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of conditions relating to forest practices, my Department has been advised that legal action has been initiated by the Forests Practices Board of Tasmania in relation to possible forest practices breaches by BAS. Until the outcomes of that legal action are known, the Government is not in a position to comment on BAS' adherence to conditions relating to forest practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the 1986 Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments BAS's recently expired export licences contained provisions concerning regeneration of private land logged for the purpose of export woodchips. For example, under licence Mepwood 975 BAS was required under Clause 11 (a) to regenerate such land at a minimum rate of four hectares per 1,000 tonnes of pulpwood extracted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 11 (b) provided that BAS shall, as soon as practicable after 18 March 1995, establish a minimum plantation area in the State of Tasmania, calculated at the rate of one hectare for each 1,000 tonnes of pulpwood that has been extracted from private land by the exporter for export as woodchips in accordance with his licence. This can only be waived if BAS is unable to comply with the requirement due to circumstances beyond its control and if it has agreed to make corresponding arrangements, not less onerous, for example regeneration in another FORWOOD Zone. These arrangements would need to be approved by my Department and Private Forestry Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition Clause 11(c) provided that BAS must, as soon as practicable after 7 March 1995, provide my Department with, amongst other things, particulars of the location and area of land regenerated and planted in compliance with these conditions. BAS has now provided this report and it has been provided to Private Forestry Tasmania to enable verification by field inspection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) See my answer to question (4).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The Commonwealth is not obliged to take any action, but it has to consider what actions may be relevant if any exporter fails to meet a licence condition. A range of legal measures are available to me as outlined in sections 8 and 9 of the Export Control Act 1982 and Regulations 14 and 15 of the Export Control (Unprocessed Wood) Regulations. These measures include instituting proceedings for offences against section 8 and 9 of the Act, suspension or revocation of a licence or, where relevant, the forfeiture of goods which are the subject of the licence. Whether any of these measures would be appropriate would depend on the circumstances of the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) It appears that BAS may have shipped a load of woodchips (approximately 34,000 tonnes) in excess of volumes for which it had an export licence. This matter has been investigated by the Australian Federal Police. The AFP have now provided a report to the Australian Government Solicitor. As indicated in my answer to Question (4) legal proceedings have been initiated by the Forests Practices Board of Tasmania in relation to possible forestry practice breaches by BAS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) See my answer to Question (7).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Each export licence specifies a woodchip volume. The Australian Customs Service maintains data on woodchip volumes exported and my Department has access to this data. In addition, the Commonwealth Government announced in the 1995-96 budget context that it would be establishing a new unit within my Department to monitor compliance with export licence conditions. This will further strengthen existing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If BAS does exceed licence volumes there are a range of legal measures the Commonwealth can pursue, as indicated in my answer to Question (6).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) See my answer to Question (9) concerning monitoring of export volumes. In addition, Tasmanian forestry agencies are responsible for monitoring of compliance with woodchip export licence conditions and other obligations under the 1986 Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments. Export licences also now include a provision requiring the licence holder provide a report to my Department on their compliance with licence conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) While the Commonwealth cannot prevent the cutting or production of woodchips, I can refuse to grant a licence to export those woodchips under the Export Control Act 1982. On 18 April 1995 and 7 August 1995 1 refused to grant woodchip export licences to BAS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) If a company is found to have breached its licence a range of legal measures are available to me as outlined in my answer to question (6).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) Regulations 14 and 15 of the Export Control (Unprocessed Wood) Regulations set out the circumstances in which I can suspend or revoke a licence. For example, where I have reasonable grounds to believe that the holder of a licence has not complied with a condition or restriction and by reason of such non-compliance, damage, degradation or disruption of the environment has occurred or there is an imminent threat that it would occur, I may suspend the licence, vary the conditions or impose additional conditions upon the licence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) In making a decision on whether I will grant or refuse an export licence I may take account of a number of relevant considerations, such as past performance of the company, if any, and any failure to demonstrate the ability to meet licence conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(15) As at 28 August 1995 BAS does not have a valid woodchip export licence. On 18 April 1995 and 7 August 1995 1 decided to refuse to grant export licences to BAS to export a total of 80,000 tonnes of woodchips.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(16) State forest agencies are responsible for monitoring State logging operations under State statutes. The Commonwealth in conjunction with State agencies monitors export licence compliance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Relocation Assistance provisions of the Mobility Assistance Scheme the Commonwealth Employment Service helps eligible jobseekers with some of the relocation costs involved in taking up the offer of permanent employment in another location. These costs may include legal and agents' fees associated with the sale and/or purchase of the jobseeker's home. Assistance is provided only if the person is unable to find work where he/she is living and the position cannot be filled by an unemployed person already living in the area of the vacancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relocation Assistance is considered to be an important element of structural adjustment of the labour market because it facilitates the movement of workers to meet the skill needs of employers located elsewhere and helps meet labour shortages. If assistance was not available to help jobseekers with the costs of selling/buying their homes, a large number of relocations that would be of benefit to the community would not occur. The benefit to the community is derived from having an otherwise vacant job filled and the savings in Government income support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 7 June 1995 (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> page 979) Senator Margetts asked me a question without notice as to why the Industry Commission's assessment of the growth and revenue implications of the Hilmer and related reforms should be believed. Senator Margetts also asked who in the Government or bureaucracy is able to undertake cost-benefit studies of potential reforms and where the resources to undertake these studies would come from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 19 August 1994, the Council of Australian Governments asked the Industry Commission, considered to have expertise in conducting large-scale econometric analyses, to undertake an assessment of the growth and revenue implications of the Hilmer and related reforms. The Commission chose the ORANI model of the Australian economy for this exercise and made modifications to simulate the impact of these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ORANI is a multisectoral model and is able to provide information at the Federal/State level as well as for several industries. The analysis takes the Australian economy in 1993-94 as the base and compares this with the economy assuming the Hilmer and related reforms have been implemented. The estimate does not include any potential dynamic growth benefits engendered by the more competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to emphasise that the reported increase in the size of the economy is an estimate. Models are not able to capture all the factors at work in analysing a particular set of issues. Furthermore, due to the approximate nature of models and the difficulty in quantifying particular policy changes, assumptions have to be made. In recognition of these limitations, the Commission in the preface of their published report state that "it is clear that no single number can be produced to capture accurately the full benefits and costs of these reforms . . . [t]he best they [technical modelling exercises] can do is provide general indications of the direction and magnitude of the benefits that flow from these reforms of different sectors of Australian society".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission have sought to make assumptions, approximations, workings and limitations of the model simulations clear and transparent. Consequently, there will be criticism over the model used for the simulations and assumptions made in conducting the analysis. However, the Commonwealth Government is confident that, consistent with the Commission's findings, the benefits from Hilmer and related reforms are substantial. As a result, the Commonwealth has subsequently committed itself financially to rewarding jurisdictions that implement the relevant reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the process of undertaking cost-benefit studies of potential Hilmer and related reforms, this should be seen as a normal part of the evaluation process in Commonwealth departments and agencies. Cost-benefit analysis using quantitative and/or qualitative assessments are a requirement for new policy proposals. The decision as to whether such studies can be done `inhouse' or contracted out to external consultants is appropriately a matter for department/agency heads. Regardless of this decision, the intention of the Competition Principles Agreement is to provide guidance in terms of the key issues that should be addressed when governments undertake reviews, for example, concerning anti-competitive regulation and reform of public monopolies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of example, the Department of Communications and Arts has recently undertaken a major review in the context of the development of the Government's post-1997 telecommunications policy, which includes the facilitation of greater competition in that sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission itself has developed expertise across a range of industries and may also be asked to conduct sectoral reviews. For example, in March 1995, the Commission reported on the implications of recent developments in the Australian gas industry for the enhancement of competition in the production, distribution and use of gas. (This study assisted the Trade Practices Commission (TPC) in its review of an authorisation granted to the Australian Gas Light Company in 1986 covering its gas marketing arrangements with Cooper Basin gas producers. The original authorisation was granted following an assessment of the public benefit.) </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competition policy reforms will result in the creation of two new national competition institutions, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), formed out of a merger of the TPC and PSA, and the National Competition Council (NCC). It is intended that the NCC will conduct, or provide assistance with reviews under the Competition Principles Agreement, such as concerning structural reform of public monopolies. The reviews it undertakes will be in accordance with a work program determined by Commonwealth and State/Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACCC will have the expertise to undertake reviews of anti-competitive regulation. For example, the TPC prepared a submission to the Industry Commission's 1994 Urban Transport inquiry assessing the effects of regulation of the taxi industry. In March 1994, it published a study report on competition and regulation in the legal profession, which followed reports of a similar nature on the accountancy and architecture professions, published in July and September 1992 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Office of Regulation Review (ORR) is responsible for administering the Government's regulation review policy, including examining and advising on proposals of new or amended business regulation. As part of its Working Nation statement, the Government announced a business regulation reform package designed to reduce the cost to business of Commonwealth regulation. In meeting its commitments under the Competition Principles Agreement and Working Nation statement, all Commonwealth portfolios will be required to prepare a draft schedule of all regulation administered in their portfolio which confers costs and/or benefits on business or which restricts competition. The ORR will assess the review schedules prepared by departments/agencies and provide advice to the Government in the context of the development of a four year regulation review timetable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Council on Business Regulation has been established to advise the Government on review priorities and on reform of regulation required to ensure that regulations are serving the public interest. The Chairman of the Industry Commission will chair the Council, he will be joined by another eight prominent people representing business and community interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resources to undertake cost-benefit studies will be met from portfolios' budget allocations. In some cases, this may require funds to be re-allocated to evaluation processes or require a re-ordering of evaluation priorities. Again, this is appropriately a decision for department/agency heads. Portfolios will also be able to draw on the expertise of the various research bureaux, such as the Bureau of Industry Economics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NCC and ACCC will be fully funded by the Commonwealth. Furthermore, as part of the national competition policy reforms, the Government has provided significant extra resources for the ACCC and some will be available to make further assessments of micro reforms at the industry level. In addition, the ORR was provided with additional resources as part of the Working Nation statement to assist it advise departments on regulation assessment and review techniques, including cost-benefit analysis.</PARA>
