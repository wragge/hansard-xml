We believe it is just totally useless to put most of these bills through as urgent; they are not urgent bills.

As a general principle, the Greens (WA) have expressed the view that at this late stage, with 16 days of the program left to go, to suddenly introduce more and more bills to be exempt from the cut-off means that there is no real prioritising and addressing of the problem but simply the creation of further problems by an ad hoc way of relating to bills.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition has tried to be particularly reasonable on these things. It was only a few days ago that we allowed, I think, a dozen or so bills through the cut-off. I might remind the Senate that the cut-off is to enable orderly planning and for the Senate to have reasonable time to consider the detail of legislation in order to do its job properly. The effect of the cut-off is that the government, basically, undertook to introduce bills in the session before that in which they wished to have the bills debated in the Senate. It was a very sensible and reasonable reform.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I was very much involved in discussions on the resolution relating to the cut-off motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In making my comments on the Family Law Reform Bill, I want to commence my contribution by simply pointing out that 1995 is the 20th anniversary of the Family Law Act. Ever since its introduction, substantial amendments have been necessary. The act needs ongoing attention. Hardly a year goes by without a major change being required to the act, regulations or court procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family is the basic unit of society. Most people obtain their comfort, support and succour from their family. It is consistently ranked as the most important aspect of people's lives and as the institution that recognises their individual worth and to which they can retreat for support. It is therefore not surprising that when a family unit breaks down there is severe hurt, emotional trauma and bitterness associated with the demise of the family unit. I look forward to the day when we, in this place, devote as much time to bolstering our families and assisting them with government initiatives as we do to dealing with consequences of breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides for further changes to the Family Law Act. In providing a legislative framework for mediation and counselling to assist in the resolution of conflict rather than having recourse to the courts, the bill is enunciating an appropriate principle. This aspect of the legislation should not be seen as an attack on my legal colleagues who practise in the area of family law. As a practitioner myself, I have experienced the difficulties of trying to resolve matrimonial discord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast majority of lawyers in this country act honourably and within the best interests of their clients. However, given the emotion charged atmosphere of matrimonial breakdown, it is often expedient to blame a lawyer or, even better, a judge for an unpalatable outcome. The one discipline in the law where clients are most likely to switch lawyers is the family law area. The reasons are manifold but I suspect emotion, anger, vindictiveness and other thought processes in this trying time are often the cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an aside, I regret the increasing number of negligence claims against family lawyers which mainly arise from the one practitioner being engaged by both parties to tie up the loose ends and then one party crying foul after a settlement has been achieved. That adds to the costs and now makes it most unlikely that lawyers are prepared to sit down with both sides to achieve a fair, speedy and relatively cheap outcome because the threat of future negligence claims hang over their heads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly mediation and counselling will be a more edifying and dignifying approach to dispute resolution in an area of life where dignity is usually lost in the hurt and anger. However, mediation and counselling only work when both parties are willing to compromise and there is some reservoir, no matter how small, of goodwill. Even without these provisions these people would normally settle without the need for a formal court hearing. Where there is no goodwill, resort to the courts will still be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Tasmanian legal practitioner, I can boast that we in Tasmania have the highest rate of settlements in Australia in the family law area. It is undoubtedly indicative of the professional and commonsense approach adopted by my colleagues in Tasmania. Counselling and mediation are categorised in the legislation as primary dispute resolution mechanisms. Obligations are imposed on practitioners and the courts to consider the efficacy of these mechanisms and accordingly advise the parties to the dispute. For the mechanisms to be effective, the same immunity needs to be afforded to the counsellors and mediators as is currently enjoyed by court based personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general terms, this legislative scheme is welcome. What is not welcome in this bill is the draconian provision to allow for the imprisonment of registrars. As a practitioner, I sometimes fleetingly dreamt about the possibility of imprisoning a registrar or a judge when they made a wrong decision or asked me a question that I could not answer. But to seriously dwell on such a proposition would be absurd. To commit it to writing, and even worse into legislation, really does deserve the gold medal for absurdity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it seems to me to be another example of a bureaucracy steamrolling the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and recommending a sledgehammer to crack a nut. But what is the nut? In this case, the penalty is directed at the wrongful disclosure of information provided under a location order by a registrar. The penalty is two years imprisonment. A tariff of two years is clearly out of kilter with the tariffs applied to other offences. Usually periods of imprisonment are legislated to act as a disincentive to act in a particular way. If a registrar did disclose improperly the location of a child then I am sure the loss of job that would undoubtedly flow from that would be a sufficient penalty in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, I find I have little to agree with the Chief Justice of the Family Court, but on this issue I am at one with him. He said in his submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee when talking about this proposed penalty:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This penalty is both unnecessary and objectionable, the Court objects strongly to it and points out that such a sanction is found nowhere else in the Family Law Act. The capacity in which Registrars will often deal with this type of information is in the exercise of delegated judicial power and it is particularly inappropriate that those with such power be liable to a criminal sanction arising out of its exercise. Under the Court's staff structure Registry Managers and not Registrars have line responsibility for registry staff and so for the recording and storage of Court records. The Registrar to whom the sanction would apply consequently has no capacity to direct the secure receipt, storage and handling of the information. Given the sensitive nature of the Court's records it is illogical that there be a criminal sanction in respect of the treatment of one type of information alone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I know of no basis on which such provision is justified. Court staff, except in the exercise of delegated judicial functions, are subject to the disciplinary provisions of the Public Service Act. There is no indication that this type of information has been treated recklessly by Court staff or that the normal disciplinary provisions under that Act would be inadequate in the event that this did occur.</PARA>
<PARA>I trust that the government will not persist with this draconian section in this bill. Another major aspect of this bill is to change the terminology of custody and access in the hope that the new phrases of residence orders and contact orders will some how instil an attitudinal change. I know that a lot of my colleagues on both sides see the change in terminology as being beneficial. I must indicate that I have some cynicism about that, although I do not oppose the change in terminology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall the change in terminology to the present guardianship and custody terms. At that time, that was regarded as being quite innovative and a way to ease the hurt in matrimonial cases where children were involved. My years of practice tell me, and I hope that I am not too cynical, that, no matter what sociological middle class terms we use, out on the street of the real world the orders made will still be distilled to `I got the kids' or `I didn't get the kids'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the new regime works, all well and good. I acknowledge the intent of the legislation is to reinforce to all parents the ongoing responsibility for their children after separation, and that of course is most worthy. All I say is that I will not be holding my breath. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Court these days, for example, basically will not make a joint custody order unless the parties agree to such an order, its attitude being that if they do not agree on a joint custody order how on earth would it work in practice. That approach adopted by the family courts around Australia seems to be a very reasonable approach. Similarly, we can use fancy words and feel good phrases but I remain to be convinced of their practical outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not think that the parents who successfully apply for orders that their children reside with them will not feel the same elation as those parents who win custody battles today. Can I say that the same tears of joy and the same tears of anguish will continue to be shed in the Family Court foyers around Australia as are shed today as a result of the court outcomes irrespective of the terminology that is employed in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of violence and access is also addressed in this bill. In the past there has been the potential for conflicting court orders relating to restraint of a party and an order for access. This is a sensitive and very difficult issue. As somebody who was involved in the setting up of a women's shelter and who was on its management committee for some years, I believe that I have some understanding of the social evil of domestic violence. Having been involved in obtaining restraint orders, I also know the very real trauma that is attached to domestic violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, there is a need for mechanisms to be in place for the granting of expeditious protection orders. However, the parliament should also keep in mind the possibility of protection orders being obtained on false information or embellished statements. Those of us who have practised in the family law area would from our own experiences be able to draw on examples where that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most circumstances it ought to be possible to immediately appeal an order suspending an access order made pursuant to a protection order and not wait the 21 days proposed in the bill. I look forward to developing that further during the committee stages. A three-day suspension prior to appeal is more appropriate and ought to be accepted by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee unanimously made the suggestion to reduce the 21 day period to three days. I trust that the minister will advance the reasons for the government's determination to proceed with a 21 day suspension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the bill inserts an object clause in part 7 of the act which will provide that children should receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential. Nobody, of course, would argue with that. It is a most laudable objective. The bill makes it clear that this objective is based on principles which are consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The government's often slavish and manic recourse to international treaties is laughable. Quite frankly, there are more credible sources and authorities for those principles than a UN convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that the government did not have to have recourse to international treaties to finally grant the grandparents of this nation their rightful place in the Family Law Act. I am sure that the only moral persuasion was that of community pressure. The grandparents of this nation organised themselves into various groups, requesting recognition under the Family Law Act, and they made a very forceful presentation to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I was privileged to be able to read their written submission and to hear their verbal submission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who deal in the area of family law know that grandparents are often the backstop in marriage breakdown. It is very good for the children involved to have some stable relationship with a relative. Grandparents often baby-sit, undertake child minding and offer very real assistance in part of the lives of their grandchildren. Regrettably, when a marriage breaks up the in-laws quickly become the out-laws and access is denied to the grandparents. Whereas previously it was seen as beneficial for the children to have regular contact with their grandparents whilst the marriage was on foot, after a breakdown contact suddenly becomes impossible or too difficult, or the grandparents allegedly become too old or frail to look after the children properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee unanimously recommended that the Family Law Act ought to be altered to provide for the special mention of grandparents.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very short in my remarks on the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 [No. 2] and the Family Law Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995. This legislation does a number of things. As well as tinkering with some of the provisions, it contains some benefits. It has come about as a result of considerable discussion in the Joint Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, within the government and within the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 September this year the Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, said that `the institution of marriage is at the heart of this government's agenda'. I applaud that statement, but I have been waiting, frankly, for years to see any evidence of that assertion. I do not in any way reflect on the minister or on the intentions of the minister, but as things stand, the family is under attack. The family is under attack in a wide range of areas&mdash;from the moral area to the economic area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have stood in this place time and time again to show that the average family, particularly those on one income, is far worse off now than it was in 1982. I know that there are figures now being bandied about by certain people who suggest that that is not the case. They tend to use NATSEM figures, which the authors of those reports and that research admit are incomplete. To give you one example, they take into account the effect of direct taxation; they do not take into account the effects that certain substantial increases in indirect taxation and in user charges are having on the family. Nor do they take into account the effects of payments that are made by the family for compulsory superannuation at a time of their lives when many of them can ill afford such payments. That sort of debate is for another occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are pressures on families and there are pressures on one-income families. There are particular pressures on single-parent families. When we are at meetings of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards we hear all the time the film industry, the television industry and the computer network industry saying, `Why should there be regulations? It's for the parents to make sure that their children are not seeing things that are inappropriate for them.' You even get that response when you cite examples of depictions and writings of child pornography, hard-core material and extremely violent material being available on the Internet and so on. Some of the industries say, `It is for the parents to be observant.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents, particularly those in one-parent families, find it extremely difficult to be mother, father, guardian and provider&mdash;going out to work and coming home&mdash;and to be able to do that. Obviously, it is their primary responsibility&mdash;I acknowledge that. But government and the rest of us who are involved in public affairs do have the responsibility to assist parents in what for them is the most important vocation that they have&mdash;that is, parenting. I suppose this is the basis for this legislation. It is attempting, I suppose, to assist parents who are separated and divorced with a parenting plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hear the commendation around the chamber for the acceptance by the government of the work done by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the issue of grandparents. I acknowledge that, and I congratulate those responsible. I happen to be the grandfather of 16, and a proud one at that. I know the pressures placed upon families with young children at this point of time. It is important to acknowledge, which this bill does, the key role that grandparents can play in these circumstances. In normal circumstances grandparents, I can tell you, play a very enormous and rewarding role. It keeps you alive, I can tell you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that hopefully is just not a platitude in this legislation is the section which places an obligation upon those involved, including judges and court counsellors, to show the way towards reconciliation of the partners. That is a laudable objective. It is high time that was done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year marriage breakdown and divorce were the highest for any year since 1975. That is very distressing. It is distressing for those directly affected&mdash;not only the couples but also the children and the parents of the couples as well, namely, the grandparents of the children. There is that personal individual cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The direct cost to the taxpayer of marriage breakdown is over $3 billion. That figure demands consideration. It demands urgent action which is designed to assist parents and families to uphold the dignity of the institution of marriage. In this place I have queried the relatively small amount paid for marriage education. Whilst the direct cost to the taxpayer of divorce each year is over $3 billion, we spend a mere $10 on average for education and support per marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important, I believe, to put a new focus on that and to enhance the role of marriage education. I know the government is looking at that. I know the minister's intentions in regard to this matter. I feel that in the economic portfolios of cabinet this matter needs to be raised and focused. If it is going to prevent marriage breakdown and encourage communication between the couples, there is a need to make sure they have common interests, to encourage their love and devotion for each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Law Act says that those involved in the administration of the law and the parties concerned should acknowledge that the family is the fundamental group unit of society, based on the union of a man and a woman voluntarily entered into for life. It is important to remind ourselves of section 43 of the act, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Family Court shall in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this act, and any other court exercising jurisdiction under this act, shall in the exercise of that jurisdiction have regard to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life.</PARA>
<PARA>That very important principle needs to be focused upon. I believe that there is a further need to give support and help to couples in the separation period, when both parties are going through enormous upheaval and turmoil, as is their family. Even from an economic point of view, if a reconciliation can be undertaken that is an enormous saving to the taxpayer. This legislation places an obligation on judges, counsellors and the like to put emphasis on reconciliation. It also places that obligation on lawyers. That might be whistling in the wind to a certain extent but I hope it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain comments that have been made by His Honour the Chief Justice of the Family Court Chief, Chief Justice Nicholson, have been mentioned in the chamber. I do not want to say much about that but I feel that his comments were not entirely appropriate. With respect, I would like to suggest to him that that view is fairly widely held amongst people whom I know in the legal profession, in the counselling profession and in other areas. I know it must be an enormously frustrating job to be Chief Justice of the Family Court&mdash;it is a job that I certainly would not want to have responsibility for&mdash;but I feel that statements of the type which were voiced by Senator Brownhill and Senator McKiernan and maybe one or two other senators and statements made by Chief Justice Nicholson were not appropriate. I refer to a letter which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 23 September 1995. The letter refers to the statements made by Chief Justice Nicholson as not being appropriate. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His Honour does not deign to offer reasoned responses to criticisms made of the Court and its performance. Instead, he blackguards "some of the Court's critics" as "dysfunctional, strident, unrepresentative and often irrational".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He surmises that much of the criticism of the Court "is an unfortunate manifestation of right wing groups demonstrating hatred of all government institutions, and particularly those they perceive may interfere with their so-called right to exercise power over people who are smaller and weaker than they are".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the tabloid press and television, he is reported as saying they were guilty of exploiting the views of aggrieved minorities and turning them into "a relentless and invariably ill-informed assault on the Court".</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wonder at my own courage in making a public response to one who himself responds to critics with such ill defined (right wing groups) and unqualified (invariably ill-informed) charges, which attack the critics without attempting to identify or answer the criticisms.</PARA>
<PARA>Here is the point of the letter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Chief Justice's speech brings no credit on the Court. Many of his statements are clearly unjudicial and seem to me to be injudicious. God help us if this is the way ahead for critics of individual judges or of courts or of the laws that the courts are established to adjudicate on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should perhaps say that neither I nor any member of my immediate family has been engaged in any litigation in the Family Court. I have never practised in that Court.</PARA>
<PARA>That letter is from the former Crown Solicitor, Mr B. O'Donovan. I think people such as he should be listened to. I do hope that Justice Nicholson does have regard to these areas when next he puts pen to paper or makes a public speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few things I want to touch on very briefly in regard to the legislation itself. One matter was dealt with by Senator Margaret Reid in relation to certain steps not being able to be taken within 21 days. As I understand it, that is by the Federal Court, but action can be taken in the magistrate's court, which may well be cheaper and more effective than in the Federal Court. I would like to have an explanation of that when we come to that particular clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I will be seeking explanations about the absolute privilege that has been given to discussions between husbands and wives with family counsellors present as compared with what occurs in discussions which are otherwise admissible between husband and wife. Also, I will be seeking information as to why action is not being taken to deal with recommendation 1(b) of the Family Law Council, that legislation should provide that it is unlawful to sterilise a child under 18 years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These family law bills are the latest pieces of legislation introduced into the parliament in the context of the Family Law Act. They certainly will not be the last, because this is an area&mdash;as those who have spoken before me have made so clear&mdash;where you can never get it right because of the problems that come about when a couple divorces or separates. As has been said by both previous speakers this morning, Senator Abetz and Senator Harradine, this is an area where tragedy looms large, where there must be compassion for people going through the dreadful traumas that are no doubt related to the break up of a family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Harradine that more should be done to see if a marriage can be preserved and, even before that, that the marriage sets out in a way that makes it last. I think what has to be changed is the culture of marriage. There is, I think, an understanding when people marry now that if things go a little harshly at times, then there is nothing much wrong with separating. I think that is a culture that has to change. Whether the government or we as legislators can do much about that, I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is quite clear that this is a very difficult area and we tend in those circumstances to blame particular individuals. I noticed this morning that Senator Harradine referred to the Chief Justice of the Family Court, Alastair Nicholson. Senator McKiernan, whom I greatly admire, took him to task yesterday. May I say that I have known the Chief Justice for many years now and watched him, both on the Supreme Court of Victoria and on the Family Court of Australia. Given the difficulties that we have spoken about, it is my opinion that he has performed outstanding service on that court and that indeed he has performed outstanding service outside it. From that statement, I go on to say that other judges in the Family Court, both men and women, have done us proud as a nation in the way they have gone about the very difficult task that they have had to perform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In this context of giving praise, in the circumstances of the present legislation, another group that I think often gets criticised, and criticised unfairly, are the people from the Attorney-General's Department who actually have to get what we legislators think about and talk about into a form of legislation that comes before us. Oftentimes they are criticised for that, but I would have thought that the efforts by Mr Richard Morgan and Amanda Davies in this particular bill deserve commendation. They have had to go through a long and difficult period to get the legislation we presently have before us. I see Peter Trahair and others here this morning. He was more than gracious in giving me some help before I got to my feet to speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Can I say about judges generally, because they are coming in for some criticism around the place, that they do perform great service to this country and in different areas. I was speaking this morning to my son Justin, who is an associate to the Deputy President of the Industrial Relations Court, Simon Williams. Again, he is a person who is in a very difficult area. With due respect to people who work in the industrial area, which I used to do myself, so I include myself in this, they do not have the difficulty that I think people who deal with the break-up of marriages do, but nevertheless, they have a most fundamental job to perform in this society, and they do it well. Certainly Deputy President Williams is one of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the good bits of news in this legislation that everybody has commented on is the fact that we give special recognition to grandparents. May I commend Senator Harradine on being a grandparent. It is something that I unfortunately have been denied to this point of time. Certainly, in respect of my own mother-in-law, Lalla Gill, the one remaining grandparent of my children, inasmuch as they are good citizens of this country and decent people, it has much to do with her. In respect of two of them, who were born when my mother, Corrie Cooney, was alive, it had much to do with her as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I do mark the great importance of the role played by grandparents. In this culture of cohesion that we should try to develop to keep families together, grandparents and, indeed, the wider family play a very big role. We have to start concentrating on that idea of the wider family&mdash;people who are related getting together&mdash;and perhaps not be quite so nuclear as families seem to be these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of deep, good thinking about this, much of which has been carried out by the people on the legal and constitutional committee&mdash;and Senator Abetz has played a great role in that. So has Senator Spindler who has put forward some amendments to this bill. I must confess that anything that Senator Spindler puts forward is a matter that I take most seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, one matter that concerns me is the way Senator Spindler wants to go around the registering of parenting plans&mdash;and this has been dealt with in the debate so far. The idea is that if husband and wife are to break apart and they want to register a parenting plan as to how the children should be looked after, then they should be able to do so in the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is suggested in the amendments put forward by Senator Spindler that, if they are to do that, both parties have to get independent legal advice as to the meaning and effect of the agreement before entering into the agreement, the plan itself has to be certified by the legal practitioners who gave that advice, and the court has to be satisfied that the arrangements set out in the plan are likely to promote the best interests of the party's child or children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very good idea indeed, the thrust of which is that children should be protected&mdash;and nobody could doubt that. I would have thought that children should be protected whether or not their parents break up. I would have thought that children should be protected whether or not the parents register a parenting plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems there is nothing peculiar in the act of registering a parenting plan which makes the children the subject of that parenting plan any more or less in need of help than any other child in the community, excepting perhaps that they are the people who are affected by the splitting up. But the very act of registration does not seem to have anything peculiar about it that should visit upon the process an examination by the court of that arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Mr Trahair told me as I came in, 95 per cent of the cases in the Family Court are settled. That would be consistent with what happens in courts generally&mdash;most disputes are settled. So the court deals with that small percentage, five per cent or less, of all disputes that come before it. I should have thought it was those disputes that ought to attract the court's attention because it is disputes that courts are about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, the Family Court is a court. That means it has to resolve disputes between the parties. It is not there as a reservoir of social workers; it is not there as a reservoir of clergymen and women; it is not there as a reservoir of psychologists or psychiatrists; it is not there as a reservoir of people who want to do the right thing socially. The court is there to decide disputes between citizens&mdash;a task that has been going on since Australia was founded and in England, from which we get our legal system, for many centuries before that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my own view that, if you are going to have a legal system run by courts, the courts ought to act as courts and not in these other characters that I have spoken about. It seems to me that, if there is no dispute brought before the courts, then the courts should not have any part in it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge with thanks Senator Abetz's interjection. If there is a dispute about the agreement, if there is a dispute whether an agreement should be entered into the first place or not and the matter should be disposed of by other means, then, of course, the courts should come into it. But I am concerned that taking away the great function and character of the court&mdash;which is, as it were, to stand above the parties; to let them put their case; and to have that case disposed of with parties introducing evidence and bringing their legal problems forward to be resolved by the court&mdash;is very dangerous not only for the Family Court but also for the whole legal system that has served us, in my view in any event, very well over the years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> From a practical point of view, it seems to me to be taking us down a path that will be very expensive&mdash;in terms of the number of judges we would have to have as well as the buildings to house them and their staff&mdash;if we are going to require the court to be satisfied that the arrangements are likely to promote the best interests of the parties' child or children, as required by the Democrats' amendment. Indeed, it would seem to me there is little point in having an agreement if the court has to be satisfied that it is one that is likely to promote the best interests of the parties' child or children, because the court would have to have a full-scale hearing to satisfy itself that that was the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads us into two problems. Firstly, there is the overwhelming amount of resources that would be needed in terms of judges, buildings and things like that. Secondly, there would be no point having an agreement, because the court has to satisfy itself that the arrangements are in the best interests of the child or children. If the court has to call evidence to decide that, why not just hear the matter and make the decision itself?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be argued, of course, that it is best for parties to agree and then for the court to look at that agreement to see whether it is proper. I go along with the point that it is best for parties to agree. Most people that split up&mdash;not all, but most&mdash;split up with sadness, no doubt, in their hearts but with sense in their heads and come to a proper arrangement. They ought to be able to pursue those arrangements that best suit them. If they do not, if there is a dispute, then the court ought to move in. But there ought to be a dispute before the court does so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If I can leave the bill with those few remarks, then I am well satisfied. It is a big issue and, as I said before, it is an issue that will be pursued hereafter. I think the present legislation is a right step, a proper step and a good step along the road. Unfortunately, with marriage breakups, I think it is very hard to make straight again the line that is bent. There is just so much difficulty in trying to get back to how things were before such a fundamental step as marriage&mdash;I see it as the most fundamental step&mdash;was, as it were, stopped from operating. That must leave tragedy in the heart. Unfortunately, marriage breakups must leave resentment at times, which sometimes even bubbles over to hatred. Those are emotions which do not make it easy for the Family Law Act to operate as people want&mdash;and it never will. But, given those parameters, I think the act does operate well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have to give our judges encouragement rather than criticism. I think we have to understand the families that the court deals with and tries to help. I think we have to thank those who, as I say, get the legislation to a form where it operates well. I think that the Attorney-General's Department, under Richard Morgan, has done that well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the Family Law Reform Bill, which is the most far-reaching legislation amending the Family Law Act since the act's introduction. As with almost every wide-ranging bill of this type, this bill has generated an enormous amount of discussion within the community. There are parts of the bill which have been hailed as being very positive, while other parts have been condemned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to the government's credit that it has provided ample opportunity for community feedback on this bill. I want to foreshadow that the Greens will be putting various amendments to the chamber in committee, but first I want to make some comments on the general issues raised by the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emphasis on primary dispute resolution by non-litigation methods in the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 is very welcome. We support a consensual approach to dispute resolution in all areas of law. This is so in family law matters, where the parties often need to establish terms for ongoing cooperation, particularly if children are involved. Many parties continue to negotiate their own resolution, and it is to be hoped that the amendments to regulations, which have yet to be finalised, will facilitate self-help in filing for consent orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was reminded on many occasions during the discussion about the bill that some 95 per cent of divorce cases do not go to the court. That is a most encouraging situation. But we have to acknowledge that there remain many matters which will require professional help, and it is to be hoped that the primary dispute resolution methods which are a focus of the legislation will add to the structures available to people who are facing up to a marriage breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of the term `primary dispute resolution' rather than `alternative dispute resolution' gives these services the priority they deserve. Similarly, we see the provisions for funding of counselling organisations and mediation organisations as worthy of support in principle, since they give a welcome emphasis to accessible, community-based dispute resolution services and reduce the focus on the institutions of the state with their tendency towards expense and complexity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe, therefore, that the whole bill should be evaluated in terms of what it achieves for access to justice. Despite the government's recent initiatives on access to justice, the practical difficulties for a substantial part of the population remain. In total, under present funding arrangements, despite the 1995-96 increases, primary dispute resolution services are inadequate to meet the need in terms of location, waiting periods and cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are likely to be left with a parallel situation to that which presently exists in the provision of legal services; that is, that the wealthy and the legally aided low-income recipients receive legal services, but to the average income earners they are prohibitively expensive. Similarly, persons living in the country are disadvantaged relative to city dwellers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be a large low cost network of primary dispute resolution providers so that everyone, irrespective of means or location of residence, is able to access them. Clearly, it is time for the government to look into creating a means of providing sessional payment of private mediators and counsellors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill leaves the way open for individuals to provide mediation services in private practice. This is a welcome position subject to suitable funding being made available as per my comments earlier. However, using a mix of mediators, counsellors and arbitrators within court, community and private categories has implications for issues of immunity and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Withholding immunity from private mediators and counsellors, as per the amendment foreshadowed by the Australian Democrats, would not be an issue if such people were accredited by the Family Court on the basis of skills and training. This would not prevent non-accredited persons mediating or counselling, and we accept that these non-accredited private mediators and counsellors should not have immunity conferred by this law. The government has advised that the regulations will set out appropriate guidelines within which private mediators must work and that their immunity will be limited to the extent to which they adhere to the regulations. While we would definitely prefer an accreditation structure, we are prepared to support the government's stance on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the proposed part VII of the bill, the principles in section 60B(2) are ones which most parents today will support and work towards in their negotiations following separation. A minority will not. The question is, how should the law treat such situations? During discussion of the bill in the community there has rightly been an emphasis on ensuring that application of the principles does not compel a parent or a child to suffer abuse and violence after separation. There has been some recognition by the courts that in some circumstances the drastic step of depriving a parent of access is necessary for the protection of the child. This bill presents an opportunity to reinforce the protection given to those&mdash;whether children or parents&mdash;who may be subject to violence or abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the bill there is recognition that not all matters are suitable for mediation. While the bill does appear to address the current problem of mediation agencies taking on clients despite the history of abuse in a relationship or continuing power imbalances, we understand the desire of groups such as the National Women's Justice Coalition to strengthen the relevant provisions. Therefore, the Greens will be supporting a number of the Democrat amendments in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we should recognise that the victims of violence are sometimes left without the means to go through litigation because of expense and a lack of legal aid funds. They are doubly victimised. I urge the government to consider a special allocation of funds for legal aid applicable to circumstances where the primary dispute resolution means are inappropriate and litigation is the only means of resolving issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also support provisions for separate representation of children. Again, they will not work unless the government is prepared to allocate adequate and specific funds for legal aid. Court protection of the rights of children in situations of separation has not been adequate. I believe that there has been an improvement but only in relatively recent times. Legal aid funding for this purpose has yet to catch up with the courts' recent decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the government's proposed amendment giving recognition that the indigenous people of Australia have particular needs in terms of attachment to a particular part of Australia, a particular cultural group or extended family. The Family Law Act should not add new generations to those who have already been deprived of growing up in their own communities. Cultural connections as provided by the government's amendment should be taken into consideration equally with a number of other factors with respect to the best interests of the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens will be putting an amendment specifically to incorporate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into the act. In particular I refer honourable senators to article 9(3) of the convention which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parties shall respect the right of the child who is separated from one or both parents to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, except if it is contrary to the child's best interests.</PARA>
<PARA>We will also be putting amendments which would allow the court to assess the effectiveness of a parent's access when the likelihood exists that the parent providing accommodation to the child will move interstate or to faraway places. The fact is that some parents do decide to limit or prevent regular access by moving. Ulterior motives are difficult to prove but on occasions it seems that the right of the child is overridden by the selfish motivation of a parent. I do not refer here to situations where a parent flees in fear of spousal violence or in situations where they are concerned about the wellbeing of the child. I am referring to actions motivated by malice towards a former spouse. The child's best interests should not be overruled in instances of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, we are acutely aware that a move interstate or even from the south to the north of the state, let alone overseas, can make access prohibitively expensive. The practice has been to seek injunctions preventing this where the interests of the child, supported by expert evidence of, for example, counselling reports, suggest the child's need to retain regular contact with both parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we support the principles underlying the bill. The amendments that we seek and support are those which emphasise the principles favouring the responsibility of parents to reach an agreement in the best interests of the child and much improved access to justice and those which place a precautionary principle in the legislation in relation to family violence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those members who have spoken in the debate on the family law legislation for the very constructive comments they have made. Once again the members of this chamber have demonstrated their bipartisan approach to the resolution of the very difficult issues associated with family law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family law legislation gives effect to a large part of the government's very positive response to the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act, in light of the further advice of the Family Law Council on the operation of UK's Children Act 1989. It is hoped that a bill to implement the second part of the government's response will be introduced later in the sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that was made by a number of speakers was the need for the government to monitor the effectiveness of the changed approach to issues affecting children. Everybody recognises that the old connotation of children being property needs to go. The government's approach takes that line. Large sections of the community currently deal with their children using the very principles that this bill is now enshrining. Unfortunately, there are members of the community who are not so enlightened and who continue to adhere to the notions of children as property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government expects that community change for that segment which needs to change will take time. The government has contracted with the Australian Institute of Family Studies to undertake in the next few weeks a survey of community attitudes to the way in which we think about and treat children. That survey will form a benchmark for gauging community attitudes to the changes in a longitudinal study to be undertaken at a number of points over the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comment was also made of the need to regulate the qualifications and training of counsellors and mediators. Where the government is funding community counselling and mediation organisations, the government has had for some time criteria for approval of those organisations, including qualifications and professional development of individual counsellors and mediators. The Family Services Council will be providing advice on the appropriateness of these criteria as part of a review as a consequence of the increased reliance upon the primary dispute resolution emphasis in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to mediators there is not an agreed qualification or training which provides professional qualifications as a mediator. The government will be laying down broad guidelines for the delivery of mediation services and providing accountability for that delivery through consumer protection mechanisms. The Attorney-General's Department has currently distributed for comment to over 400 relevant professional, community and interested groups a discussion paper outlining the draft proposals in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler's comments focused on his proposed amendments and in particular a prescriptive regime to deal with cases involving family violence and abuse. The government takes the view that this is the wrong approach and that the issues of whether or not particular primary dispute techniques should be utilised in a particular case is a matter for the professional judgment of the deliverer of the services. The government's approach is shared by the Family Law Council, which is a multidisciplinary body which considered the suggestion for the prescriptive regime made by the National Women's Justice Coalition which are embodied in the Democrats' amendments. In advising the Attorney-General in respect of the NWJC suggestion, the Family Law Council stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the council's view that it is not appropriate for judges, registrars, legal practitioners and others to be making such mediation intake decisions. The proposal of the NWJC would impose a barrier pre-intake. Council considers that it would be most inappropriate for, say legal practitioners, to be saying to clients that mediation would not be appropriate in their case. Mediators are specially trained to properly address such questions and the matter should be left in their hands at the time of intake.</PARA>
<PARA>The government is pleased that a number of speakers expressed approval of the change in terminology adopted in this legislation to get away from the concepts of custody and access. I note that the Democrats intend to move amendments based on a suggestion of the NWJC to reinstate the existing system under another name. This system has been rightly criticised by most of the speakers in the debate because of the negative effect and the entrenchment of treating children as a possession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some speakers in the debate have taken the view that the government's approach of allowing parents to work out their own solutions and arrangements in respect of children following the break-up of a relationship without the input of lawyers is an attack on the legal profession. Nothing could be further from the government's view in this matter. Parents should be able to obtain assistance from whoever they feel is appropriate in reaching decisions and developing their parenting plans. This may be lawyers, counsellors, mediators or other professionals. Parents should be able to expect that the decisions they arrive at will be respected within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as in intact families, governments and bureaucracies leave decision making about children to parents without any interference and/or intrusion unless the child comes to attention as needing protection of the state, so separated parents ought to be afforded the opportunity to decide arrangements for their children without intrusion from the law, the court, the legal profession or the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Attorney-General's concern about registration of parenting plans is not shared by government. So long as the parties voluntarily comply with the plan, there is no intrusion. However, if one party does not comply or wishes to change the plan without the other's agreement, the court will then consider whether the arrangements are, at that later time, in the best interests of the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deputy President Reid correctly saw the need for parents to be given this flexibility to make agreements and not to have the court examine them to see whether it would agree to those arrangements. Experience shows that once parties are involved in the court system their flexibility in reaching solutions is reduced. The adversarial nature of litigation may lead to consideration of issues or the taking of positions more suited to an adjudicated position rather than a solution which they can consider to be their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine has asked the minister what progress has been made in relation to the implementation of the Family Law Council report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sterilisation and other medical procedures on children</EMPHASIS>. It is currently with the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The WA Law Reform Commission report had some conflicting recommendations on this matter. The Commonwealth is preparing a Standing Committee of Attorneys-General paper on the issues to be considered at its February meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the debate has raised clause 67P of the bill, which makes provision for penalty to be imposed on court officials who intentionally or recklessly disclose information about the location of a person where that information has been located under a location order. The person seeking a location order needs to convince the court that there is a proper reason for the issuing of such an order. In many cases the need to locate has arisen because the parent with the child has gone into hiding to avoid family violence or abuse. The providing of information to the abuser in those circumstances reduces the protection that that parent has sought. The government is concerned to ensure that protection from family violence is not diminished by the actions of court processes or improper disclosure of information. Clause 67P as it stands will achieve that purpose. I commend the bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments set out the relevant factors that are to be taken into account by the court and by other persons, for instance, legal practitioners and counsellors, when they are considering what primary dispute resolution mechanisms, if any, may be suitable for the parties. The Democrats felt that it was important to have the factors that are to be taken into account transparent in the bill, on the face of it, bearing in mind that what is in the bill very often sets the climate and influences the understanding of people who are in court or who are dealing with a dispute, are seeking to make a decision and are seeking to be advised as to whether a primary dispute resolution mechanism is suitable for them or whether they should proceed to court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The factors that the Democrats believe should be taken into account are, first of all, the degree of equality or otherwise in the bargaining power of the parties, the risk of child abuse, the risk of family violence, the emotional and psychological state of the parties, whether one of the parties may be seeking to use a primary dispute resolution method possibly to gain delay or to achieve some other advantage, and any other relevant matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned that the parties which seek to shortcut in some way the proceedings and use alternative methods of dispute resolution, while we support the principle, may not be in a position of equal knowledge or equal power. We believe that the alternatives should be assessed carefully before they are entered into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we suggest that the bill should make quite clear that that is done both as a reminder and to set the tone and the culture. We have talked about the culture of the Family Court and the proceedings. We believe that it is very important to have that in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is also the view of many women's organisations which have contacted us. No doubt they have contacted other people as well, including the Attorney-General's department. They are concerned that in many situations it is the woman who could be at a disadvantage in these proceedings. They have suggested very strongly that it is necessary to set the tone in the bill and to warn all the parties in this process that these matters should be taken into account.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see the move by the Democrats as an unnecessary encumbrance to the process. In essence, we have amendments which seek to insert into the act sections relevant to primary dispute resolution methods. The factors are currently contained in order 25A, rule 5. This rule applies to court mediators and specifies the factors that a mediator must consider when determining whether a dispute is appropriate for mediation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments would require the court to give detailed consideration to these factors. In essence, that would mean that the primary dispute resolution methods which might be available would not be available, if these amendments were passed, until an advanced stage of the proceedings. It is important for us that the primary dispute resolution methods be considered early in the process. We see that the move by Senator Spindler could mean in many instances that would not be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do anticipate problems in terms of people being denied those primary dispute resolution methods at an early stage. This would have an important impact on the process. We recognise it is important to tread warily in this area. The Attorney-General's Department has prepared a discussion paper on the proposed regulatory requirements to apply to mediators. The paper proposes that before conducting a mediation the mediator should consider the factors that Senator Spindler seeks to have inserted. The paper also gives a higher priority to safety and violence issues than the amendments do. We think that the factors should be taken into account earlier. As a consequence, we oppose Senator Spindler's move at this stage. </PARA>

At the moment he is simply saying that the legal practitioner, the media and the counsellors are aware of all these things.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not want to cut across any questions that Senator Spindler wished to ask the minister; I just want to indicate that the Greens support the Democrat amendments. I take the opportunity of asking the minister, because this is the appropriate time, what the government's view is on looking at the sessional payment of private mediators and counsellors and at the fact that there is inadequate funding available. So there are two matters. One is any provisions the government might have in mind for increasing the level of funding in the light of the changes that are being made, which are very welcome. We believe it is desirable that people should have greater access to primary dispute resolution processes. So the first question relates to funds and the absolute necessity to address that funding need. If we are going to bring new measures within the reach of people then we ought to allow them the capacity to take them up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter relates to accreditation. We need to look at a system of accreditation which may operate from within the Family Court process or have some kind of link to that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can answer in part the first two parts of the question, and I undertake to come back to you with some of the finer details. In respect to payments, my understanding is that people do pay on an income basis and that money goes to counselling organisations. The justice statement, you might remember, also allocated extra resources for counselling in this area. At the moment we cannot locate the actual amount of extra resources through the justice statement, but I will come back to you with that. I will probably come back to you on the third point you raised as well during the course of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While you are seeking to answer that question, I might spell out a little more detail for the ease of the people providing the answer. Basically, the Greens see the need to permit sessional payment of private mediators and counsellors. Family Court counselling services, we think, should not only be a direct provider of services and should not be the only point for services but a point of contact at which primary dispute resolution, if the client is suitable, is guaranteed irrespective of means, and I understand that the minister is looking at the means.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the way in which that funding is given is also of concern. If the court itself, or an approved counselling or mediation organisation is unavailable, then the client should be able to be referred to a private mediator or counsellor. But, for the system to work, maybe this bill should be amended to provide, firstly, a system of accreditation and, secondly, to provide for payment on a sessional basis, albeit with partial cost recovery or means testing of the client. I know that has not been proposed, but I seek the minister's advice on it because I believe that mediation services would then be much more widely available. This is of particular importance to country residents who may have to travel considerable distances to attend the Family Court or a community mediation service but who may have an accredited mediator&mdash;whether, for example, a lawyer or a social worker&mdash;in the vicinity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the family law is a discrete area in which it would be relatively simple to establish an accreditation system administered by the Family Court. The Supreme Court of Western Australia has a panel of accredited mediators for civil disputes, so there is no reason why the Family Court should not do likewise. I think the restrictions of this bill, which place restrictions on funding counselling and mediation organisations&mdash;that is, that the whole or substantial part of the organisation's activities be family counselling or mediation respectively&mdash;will thus be overcome, and funds could be distributed to any accredited primary dispute resolution provider in accordance with the amount of family law mediation provided. That would expand the network of services quite greatly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in putting that to the minister, I point out that I would like to see those matters responded to by the government. The Greens are not putting up amendments to that effect; we see the amendments put up by the Democrats as addressing similar concerns but not exactly tackling them in that way, so we would like a government response to these suggested improvements. No doubt the government has been lobbied in this area and may already have a view, but it would be good to have this added to this committee consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think I can give you an answer that will satisfy you. What I can say, as is reflected in this legislation, is that the government has recognised the three different tiers of counselling provision&mdash;court, community based and private.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to reinforce the comments made by the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Vanstone. I find the intent of the amendment, that we give the capacity to those fronting up to mediation to be able to sue their mediators, somewhat incongruous. As I said in the second reading debate, in the past family lawyers have in fact been pretty immune from negligence claims, whereas now unfortunately they are starting to come in. Most of them are based on those situations where, in smaller towns or practices, a husband and wife have come in together seeking the assistance of the one lawyer to tie up the loose ends, to get a quick response. They want it fair, they want it cheap. But then, after the fullness of time, bitterness takes over and one of them cries foul.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the cost of these agreements is now becoming a lot more expensive because no lawyer will ever again, I would assume, act for both sides in a dispute because they do not have that protection from being sued.

I should have thought that, with the increase in mediation that we want to see, we ought be encouraging private mediators. If we want to encourage mediators, we do need to provide them with a protection so that they can go about their job without fear or favour, or the concern that they may be sued at a later stage when they have acted within the best interests of everybody but one of the parties does not consider it to have been within his or her best interests. </PARA>

It is different to the atmosphere one gets in litigation where you have advocates contesting each other. In the sphere of mediation you have an environment where things are said in a candid and forthright fashion in an effort to try to sort things out and different rules apply. When you are at that stage, it is on a without prejudice basis, so that what either party says to the other cannot be held against the other party. That is the environment which leads to possible resolution of disputes.</PARA></TALK.START>

The very statement that Senator Abetz made, which was, `Nobody would engage in private mediation if there were a possibility of being sued' is exactly the point. It is a difficult issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an invidious situation. That is why the Greens are at the moment supporting the Democrats' amendments. We do not see the logic&mdash;as has been referred to by Senators Vanstone, Abetz and Ellison&mdash;in withholding immunity from private mediators and counsellors, provided that they have been accredited by the Family Court on the basis of skills and training. We agree that this would not prevent non-accredited persons mediating or counselling but we feel that such non-accredited private mediators and counsellors should not have immunity by this law.

The fact that it is actually being so liberal in distributing the quality of immunity to people without any kind of responsibility being exercised actually goes against the principle of giving immunity. It should be given very carefully. It should be given in cases where it can be supported and not just given to anybody who has the capacity to take on that role in a self-appointed fashion.

It does say that evidence of anything said or admissions made at a meeting shall not be admissible. That is giving absolute privilege to what may be said by husbands and wives in that particular conference.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here, we are talking about the question of removing the immunity from suit for private mediators. Senator Abetz asked for me to give an account of how the law will operate. I will do that. I think it is worth putting on record that section 19M of the Family Law Act does provide that any approved mediator has the same protection and immunity as a judge of the Family Court. This means that the mediator, in performing the functions of a mediator, is protected from civil suits such as defamation, negligence and related matters such as breach of confidence. Under the bill, it is proposed to extend the immunity to all categories of mediators&mdash;to court mediators, to community mediators and to private mediators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments of Senator Spindler's to section 19M would discriminate against private mediators by removing the immunity from this category of mediators. I must say in passing that if there is anything that would act against encouraging private mediators in this area, it would be this set of amendments together with the next set that Senator Spindler is to move. It is important that the immunity protection be extended to all categories of mediators, to facilitate the greater use of mediation to resolve family law disputes. It is a major plank of the bill, a plank to which Senator Vanstone, Senator Abetz and Senator Ellison have referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If immunity is not extended to private mediators, they may decline to take on family law mediation. This could lead to problems in accessing mediation for family law disputes. It could mean the shift to greater use of dispute resolution mechanisms is not able to be achieved. One of the fundamental objectives of the bill could be undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private mediation, we should keep in mind, would be subject to regulations. These regulations would provide for consumer protection requirements to be met. If met, the mediator would then be able to rely on confidentiality provisions in the bill, such as proposed section 19N. It provides that anything said during a mediation which is conducted in accordance with the regulations cannot be used in evidence in later proceedings, subject to an exception for domestic violence matters and for serious criminal offences. So the Democrats have moved an amendment with respect to this, and we will be getting to that aspect later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ellison, I think it was, raised the question of monitoring how this part of the bill would operate. It is something the government is keen to do. We will ask the Family Services Council and the proposed ADR advisory council to examine the operation of the regulations to see, for instance, whether further consumer protection provisions such as the imposition of penalties or any other matters are necessary. We recognise that it is important to keep an eye on this area but, reflecting what others have said earlier, if this amendment is carried one of the major objectives of the bill could be undermined.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This, of course, will be defined clearly in the regulations, but the government's objective is to ensure that people know what the qualifications are before the service is provided at the intake level.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that it is important that the private mediators be given immunity, especially in relation to such things as defamation and not only in relation to whether they might act in a professionally negligent way. With respect, even those of us who do have qualifications behind our name or might be registered do make mistakes and errors of judgment. I would imagine that anybody who has practised in the area of family law has undoubtedly made mistakes, although they were very well intentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall a conciliation conference, or a registrar's conference, where it was suggested by the registrar, all well meaning, that undoubtedly a court would make a certain determination on the matter. My own view was that the registrar was right so I advised my client accordingly and she wisely said, `No, take it to court,' and we won. My view and the registrar's view were in fact wrong in the view of the judge. Just because somebody has the imprimatur of being a professional in a particular area, even with all the best will in the world, errors will still be made. </PARA>

I ask if the minister can indicate when the regulations are to be promulgated and whether assent to this bill will be deferred until such time as the regulations are fully in place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my past life as a practising clinical psychologist I often viewed the immunity coverage of lawyers with great envy. It is absolutely amazing to me that we have three members of the legal profession who are so kindly giving this away in the interests of people having access to counselling. Within my own profession we were aware of concerns about people who were able to take on that role. We believed that there should be some provisions covering that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an extraordinary state of affairs. I should be supporting the government's willingness to extend this coverage to people like myself and other professionals. In the past we would not have dreamed of gaining this coverage. However, I am opposing it. Ironically, the lawyers, whom I often found were so jealous in guarding it, are generously giving it away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the coalition to rethink the situation and consider supporting the amendment on the basis that, in the time it takes to go back to the House of Representatives and be checked, they might have time to ascertain whether they are in error in supporting it. If the amendment does not succeed, I want to place on the public record that I believe that the government&mdash;and the coalition in supporting the government&mdash;is trying to do the right thing. The government is trying to make mediation accessible. However, what it is doing is protecting the mediators without necessarily thinking through the protection of the people who are trying to get access to this help. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might briefly reply to the allegation that the argument I put forward earlier was to `try it and see': that is, using it as a social experiment and then tailoring the legislation after one sees how it goes.

They have to be approved by the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new section 13C states that certain standards must be met by any such organisation. The minister has said that, prior to the enactment of the bill, these regulations dealing with the whole process of accreditation will be in place. We are not unleashing unqualified people on the community. We are not unleashing on the community any social experiment which could perhaps go drastically wrong and cause great social damage. I do not believe that it is in that context at all. </PARA>

I think there are adequate safeguards here for the community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government essentially opposes this amendment for much the same reasons as the ones that have already been discussed in relation to the earlier amendment. At this stage I will answer the point that Senator Harradine's raised earlier. He linked the issue of the confidentiality of discussions between husbands and wives before counsellors with the issue of admissibility in evidence of other discussions or communications between husbands and wives. Whether discussions between husbands and wives would be admissible in evidence will depend on the application of the rules of evidence in proceedings before the Family Court. They are set out in the Evidence Act. There has been some discussion of them in deliberations on this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A related issue is whether a husband or wife can compel his or her spouse to give evidence of a communication made between them during their marriage. Section 100 of the Family Law Act provides that parties to a marriage are competent and compellable to disclose such communication. There is here a fundamental difference between the confidentiality provisions in the act relating to discussions before counsellors and the compellability of spouses to disclose marital communications in family law proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the former, the confidentiality provisions encourage candour and frankness during the conciliation stages of court proceedings. Without such provisions, subsequent court proceedings would be able to traverse matters discussed and statements made during conciliation conferences. One can very readily understand the impact of this. The compellability of spouses prevents, once conciliation efforts have not secured the settlement of Family Court proceedings, one spouse being able to frustrate the presentation of the case of the other by refusing to give evidence of statements made to each other during the marriage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth placing on notice for the Senate that this compellability aspect of evidence law has been Commonwealth policy for over 30 years. It is reflected in section 100 of the Family Law Act, and it reflects the pre-existing provisions of subsection 97(3) of the now repealed Matrimonial Causes Act 1959. So for a long time this compellability question has been reflected in that legislation. The confidentiality of provisions in respect of proceedings before counsellors is quite different from that. Having said that, the government feels that the Democrats amendments would, in essence, frustrate the private counselling and mediation service in a way that we do not accept. </PARA>

We are certainly of the view that if parties, husband and wife who are now separating and divorcing, want to come to their own arrangements and do not want to have any association with the Family Court, fine, they can come to their own arrangements and make whatever plans they want with respect to their parenting. But, once they come and want the imprimatur in any way of the court, and there are any consequences that flow from registration, then it is important that each of those parties have independent advice as to the consequences of what they are doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, Minister, you want to make a case when we come back to this matter this afternoon that there are no consequences at all from the registration of a plan, you might convince people to think differently, but if you say there are no consequences in the registration of a plan it raises this question: why do you bother to do it in the first place? So I will be interested in the arguments that the minister will be putting forward in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that each party gets independent advice. The party who comes to the negotiations in a weaker position may well, for a whole variety of reasons, agree to a plan that subsequently they want to undo with all the consequent difficulties. I understand the argument that says, `Look, when parents are agreeing we should let them agree and not have the bureaucracy or the court interfering'&mdash;and that is right. But it is not the court that is stretching its arm out here and saying, `If you come to some agreement you must come and register it with us'; it is people who want to avail themselves of the court and register their plan. On that basis I think it is fair enough to say, `Look, each party should have separate advice; one is definitely going to be stronger than the other, and it is important that both parties at the time of agreeing to that plan understand the consequences of what they are doing'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The analogy has been drawn by a number of people between parenting plans being registered and consent orders. Amendment 63D(1)(c) combined with 63D(1) and (2), as I am advised, will put the registration of these plans and the court's consideration thereof in the same category as consent orders. There is some difficulty in saying that a Family Court which obviously has the interests of the children at heart will simply register a plan without even having the slightest interest in the contents thereof, that a plan could be registered by two weirdos, or one weirdo and a weaker party who was an absolute disaster, and the court would in any event just register it. The court has to have some interest in this matter, otherwise why is its name being lent to the plan by virtue of its registration?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the matters, Minister, I would be happy for you to give some indication of the government's view on. I might also flag that, while I understand the government is not going to agree with this amendment, it has been put together with some advice and/or assistance from them. But, Minister, I think you must acknowledge that, of the proposals put forward, you prefer this one to the Democrat one. I would be grateful for your advice in that respect. It is certainly what I understand to be the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Vanstone, I am not quite sure why we are dealing with this amendment out of order, because I was dealing with amendments 11 and 12 and we have jumped to Democrat amendment No. 25. However, be that as it may, the amendment moved by Senator Vanstone is identical to the first part of the Democrats' amendment in that it requires that a parenting plan should be signed by the parties; the copy of the plan should be accompanied by a statement certifying that each of them has had independent legal advice; and the court should be satisfied that the arrangements set out in the plan are likely to promote the best interests of the child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am grateful to Senator Vanstone for putting such an eloquent and erudite argument in favour of these provisions, because it is quite clear that this is a very basic, major issue. Should we treat children as chattels? Should we allow parents to make arrangements without the court or anyone else really assessing whether the prime purpose of the Family Law Act&mdash;namely, that it should operate to preserve and promote the best interests of the child as a priority&mdash;has been taken care of in that particular aarrangement or agreement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is why the Democrats put forward that amendment. In discussing it with Senator Vanstone, as she said, she basically agreed with that, but is suggesting an additional subsection which says that the court may, but is not required to, have regard to all or any of the matters set out in subsection 68F(2). That is a slight softening of the provision; it does not lock the court into a lengthy proceeding and I am certainly prepared to accept that&mdash;I think it is useful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, subsection (3), the other section that Senator Vanstone is adding, says that the rules of the court may deal with how the plan may be registered in a court. That also is useful. There has been quite a lot of discussion about how the court can best handle this. Suggestions were made of devising checklists which perhaps the registrar can deal with at first instance, and only when the registrar is unhappy after a fairly automatic check of a checklist is it brought to the attention of the court as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That provision too, as a machinery provision, promotes the acceptance of the basic principle that the court has a responsibility to ensure that the interests of the child are at all times given priority and are safeguarded by the court. We should not allow the court or the government to say, `We will not take account of that responsibility. We will allow people to make whatever arrangements they wish and we are prepared to stamp it with a court's approval, as it were, by registering it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that people say that the court will become involved if one of the parties comes back to the court and says, `The other party is not performing. We want to enforce it.' But the reality is that most people will not do that. They take the view that an agreement has been made, the court has stamped it, it is a semi-official document and, `We will not disturb it', unless the circumstances are very extreme indeed. It seems to us that that precaution should be taken not when there is a complete breakdown of the agreement, but when the court is asked to rubber stamp it and to say, `This is an enforceable agreement.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise the matter of the University of Queensland's move to take over Bond University. This is anything but simply a straightforward matter of national educational policy, crucial though that is. At the heart of the matter is not only educational policy but also the issue of the behaviour of foreign investors in this country. Looming in that is possible unlawful behaviour and even criminal activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee now has a specific reference on Bond University for early examination and report. The immediate concern of that reference is the proposed major shift in the way in which higher education is offered in Australia. That issue cannot be allowed to go by default. Any move to allow public universities to operate or in any way become involved in private universities must be a compromise of the traditional charter of free, secular and public education which has existed in Australia for decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My purpose is to go wider&mdash;to look at the agendas of foreign investors and their agents which have generated the present takeover. I think we neglect at our peril what these reveal. Until these aspects have been thoroughly examined and the work of the Senate committee concluded, I believe that, out of respect for Australia's national interests, neither the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan nor the University of Queensland should seek to proceed to finality and, indeed, should not be permitted to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note reports that the university has tendered $109 million for the land and buildings of the Bond University project and has taken the Delfin Property Group to develop the land which is surplus to university requirements. The University of Queensland is reported as regarding its projected investment in Bond University and its operation of Bond University as being outside the public purview. It needs to be said that there is simply no money, nor are there any assets, under the control of the University of Queensland which do not belong to the public register. It is simply nonsense to say, as has been reported in the media, that public funds are not involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reports suggest that the university will still have to find about $80 million for the campus segment. At current market rates such a borrowing would mean an annual interest bill of over $8 million. Since start-up in 1989, Bond University's recurrent accounts show a series of heavy losses, even though the university paid nothing towards its establishment nor any annual charge in respect of the land and buildings it occupies. The short-term gain from the cost cutting in which Bond has recently engaged may be at the expense of long-term viability and therefore merely costs deferred. Bond is massively in debt&mdash;some $94 million&mdash;though this debt has been subordinated and is no immediate burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bond's 1994 company returns, having this somewhat unreal basis, show an operating `profit' of some $6.4 million. But allowance needs to be made for the recurrent costs&mdash;rates and the like&mdash;on the land and buildings now met by the Japanese companies in receivership. These may be as much as $3 million per annum. This would mean only $3.4 million per annum towards interest charges of over $8 million. This makes no allowance for the impact of additional costs for additional infrastructure, nor does it make any allowance for diminution in student numbers which might follow a change in the character of the university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem to an observer from the sidelines that the University of Queensland is heading itself into a difficult financial situation with real risk of being forced back on the public purse. That, of course, is something the government has said emphatically it will not accept. However, if one turns to the wider context, it is not difficult to sense how this financial backdrop has come about, how Bond University has come to this difficult juncture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bond University is a surprising creation&mdash;a singular and atypical flowering out of the entrepreneurial excesses and misdeeds of the 1980s. Its unlikely genesis was as a land development catalyst created by two notable corporate high-fliers of that time, Mr Alan Bond and Mr Harunori Takahashi. Mr Bond became bankrupt and served time in prison; Mr Takahashi did not face any bankruptcy process but is now embroiled in criminal indictment in Tokyo for breach of trust and fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By January 1991, the game was up for the Australian Bond Corporation. It also appeared to be up for Japan's EIE International&mdash;Mr Takahashi's vehicle. The Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, as EIE's leading creditor, had moved in its own officers and taken charge of EIE's small headquarters in Tokyo and thence its huge operations elsewhere. Curiously, the bank seems to have left Mr Takahashi to go about freely&mdash;his lifestyle not much disrupted. Mr Bond's creditors were less kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The true relationship of Mr Takahashi and his EIE corporation with the Long Term Credit Bank is a matter of some conjecture. Certainly it is a curious relationship for a bank, given Mr Takahashi's meteoric rise from relative obscurity and his incredible appetite for borrowings for grandiose risky investments. Mr Takahashi is rumoured to have some family connections with senior officials of the bank. Whatever of that, such were his powers of persuasion with the Long Term Credit Bank that his Australian subsidiary, EIE Australia, alone accumulated debts to the bank of around $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I find it astounding that, despite the publicised bankrupt state of EIE International and the known fact of the Japanese bank's officers controlling its operations, our Foreign Investment Review Board gave approval for EIE Australia to purchase the Australian half-share of the Bond project partnership. This is the more remarkable since at that time, December 1991, an Australian group&mdash;and I understand one of the recent contenders for Bond University&mdash;was actively seeking to buy these assets. This was known to the bank's officers. The administration of Bond Corporation had wished to sell to the Australian group but the Japanese partner, by then the Long Term Credit Bank, withheld agreement. It is to be noted here that EIE and Mr Takahashi had come under regulatory scrutiny by the Tokyo stock exchange and the Japanese ministry of finance as far back as 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament and the Australian community deserve to be told why the Foreign Investment Review Board gave such an approval and on what representations and documentation. The Long Term Credit Bank action which followed is even more bizarre. The agents of the bank, for it was the bank calling the shots, acted in a brutal fashion to force out of office the independent members of the Bond University governance, on the university company and the council, and to replace them with the bank's nominees. Whether all requirements of the Queensland act and the memorandum and articles were met in this case is another question. I think it outrageous that a private Australian university, operating independently under an act of the Queensland parliament, could have been thus treated by a large and reputable Japanese bank&mdash;one of Japan's most prestigious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having busied itself with the new governance of Bond over the next 18 months, the bank suddenly changed tack. In Japan at that point, the bank reportedly walked away from EIE International&mdash;though, curiously, EIE is still trading. It has been alleged that the bank has continued to be involved and to support the company through the back door. The latest Australian Securities Commission return for EIE Australia&mdash;for 1994, but signed in Tokyo by Mr Takahashi in May this year&mdash;shows known bank people as directors: Mr Ogawa and Mr Yaginuma. The unfortunate young Mr Yaginuma suicided in January 1994 in ominous circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we can say with certainty is that in August 1993 the bank put into receivership the EIE Australia subsidiaries Limgold, Nista and Jadekent, which held the land and buildings of the Bond University project. The bank did not put EIE Australia into receivership even though that company was massively in its debt. Nor did the bank attempt to put the Bond University company into receivership. It seems that the bank was inhibited by a subordination deed drawn in May 1990 between Limgold and the university company. The terms of that deed made virtually worthless the bank's security of the university debt of nearly $100 million. Spice is added here by the fact that the Japanese subsidiary Limgold and the university company&mdash;the authors of the deed&mdash;had, and continued to have, certain common directors, including Mr Takahashi. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that the Australian Securities Commission would be interested and have a responsibility to be interested in this whole saga. After receivers were appointed to the Japanese subsidiaries in August 1993, the nature and active personnel of the governance of Bond University appear to have changed. According to a Queensland Supreme Court writ lodged on 28 September 1995 by the Bond University company, its board members ceased after August to be agents of the Japanese defendant, the EIE subsidiary, Limgold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994 company returns for Bond University Ltd mention Japanese directors&mdash;Mr Oba; Mr Lievre, as alternate for Mr Oba; and the inevitable Mr Takahashi&mdash;as directors when the 1994 returns were lodged; namely, on 22 September 1995. These are the directors of Bond University Ltd, along with Messrs Wran and Turnbull, and Professors Messel and Farrar. This is the company which is negotiating with the University of Queensland for the takeover of Bond University. Excepting Professor Farrar, all these were directors at the time of the changeover in August 1993, as was a further Japanese director&mdash;the unfortunate Mr Yaginuma. Mr Takahashi, as it happened, did not attend any board meetings in 1994. He had his own problems in Tokyo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How, in the light of all this, one should assess the standing of members of the present governance of the Bond University company and the university council is a question to be answered. What relationship, if any, has remained between the Long Term Credit Bank and the directors, including the Australian directors Messrs Wran and Turnbull, who were previously its agents? What process has been invoked to change the earlier relationship?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the Long Term Credit Bank is in some trouble in Japan. I am not surprised. Press reports say that Japan's financial system is in serious crisis. Having regard to the activities of the Long Term Credit Bank in Australia, I would think the Australian government ought to take a close look at what is happening in Japan and what the implications may be for Australia. I will not dwell on the sale process of the land and buildings of the Bond University project, nor will I go further afield to say anything about the other great arm of Mr Takahashi in Australia&mdash;Sanctuary Cove development.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do say, however, that the process of the sale of the Bond project land and buildings has not diminished the bizarre quality of the whole saga. To mention just one aspect of the sale, there is a bid from the present governance of the Bond University company&mdash;whatever be the standing of that governance. It is a bid to buy the assets from the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan when the Bond University company is massively in debt to the bank, when the bank's nominees are seemingly on the board of the university company, and when that company has directors in common with the companies in receivership. In this whole matter there is a smell&mdash;a smell wafting all the way from the Gold Coast to Tokyo. In Australia's interests, the air needs to be cleared. It can be cleared by a thorough inquiry and prompt, resolute government action. There is certainly a case for Australian regulatory authorities to be called to account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by observing that the federal Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) only last week sounded an ominous note. Speaking on the Gold Coast he said that since 1991 the Japanese government has been trying to crack down on the Yakuza crime gangs. Mr Kerr is reported as citing intelligence reports to say that at least 28 Yakuza and associates from seven major gangs travelled to this country on at least 65 occasions between 1989 and 1993. How many have visited Australia during 1994 and 1995?. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody who knows anything about Yakuza crime gangs knows they do not stop. They are in a class apart. Their connections go deep in Japanese society and Japanese business enterprise. Is the government expecting Australians to believe that none of the Yakuza had any association with Mr Takahashi or with his Australian operations? Huge amounts of money were flowing, who knows where. The whole record bristles with curious behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have previously spoken about the Yakuza on the Gold Coast. On 26 November 1992, I spoke about it from the document prepared by the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. I refer to page 3728 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. The takeover of Bond University by the University of Queensland does not start with a clean slate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have given considerable thought about whether I should mention the matter which I intend to canvass today. Perhaps I should have let the matter rest in the hope that the occurrence, which I shall outline, does not occur again. Because the matter is an internationally sensitive one, I was tempted to remain silent. On balance, however, I do not believe that I can. I trust that the authorities in the Royal Thai Embassy in Canberra will understand why I have raised the matter and I trust that senior authorities in Thailand will similarly understand my reason for speaking today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My main purpose in speaking is to make a plea to the media in Australia. That plea is for them to become more aware of the customs, traditions and general way of life of our Asian neighbours. The plea, however, goes further. Having become aware of our neighbours' customs, let us all&mdash;and my plea is principally to Australia's media&mdash;respect the way of life in those countries and not act in a way which is likely to offend. This should be a normal courtesy, but there is an overriding national concern: if we are to be accepted by Asian countries as a nation worthy of their respect, we must extend our respect to them. We should acknowledge that we have customs which are different from those which prevail in other countries and that many of our customs may be regarded as strange by our Asian neighbours. Just as we would hope that our way of life is respected so, too, do our neighbours expect that we will show respect to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many honourable senators would be aware of my interest in the welfare of Australian citizens who are held in overseas prisons. My interest was aroused when I was approached by two Queensland constituents whose daughter was imprisoned in Thailand. Before I visited this lady in prison, I must admit that I was thinking of her welfare alone. Within minutes of entering the prison, I realised that the issue was far wider than I had thought. There were, at that time, four Australian women in that prison and I later became aware of Australian men who were imprisoned in the same city, two of whom I visited in two separate prisons. I have since had contact with other parents and friends whose loved ones are imprisoned in the same country and other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because Australia has not established a transfer scheme for international prisoners, the only way prisoners in Thailand can return to Australia is to complete their sentence or receive a royal pardon. Such a pardon is not royal in name only. It is very much a pardon which is granted by His Majesty the King of Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The negotiations to secure a royal pardon for my constituent's daughter&mdash;whom I shall refer to as Mary Smith from now on to respect her privacy&mdash;took a long time. This is understandable, because the King would have to be absolutely certain that a pardon is deserved before one is granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towards the end of last year, negotiations in relation to Mary Smith were at a crucial and delicate stage. I was dismayed when an officer from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told me that an offensive cartoon had appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper, accompanying the story about the release of two Australians who had received a royal pardon. The Tandberg cartoon may have been regarded as clever by Mr Tandberg and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, but it was, in fact, offensive to the Thais. It mocked the King of Thailand, something the Thais would never do. The King is held in great esteem in Thailand and any insult to the King is a very serious offence. I could understand the Thais' displeasure and I believe an officer from the Australian embassy in Bangkok was officially informed of this displeasure. I knew immediately that the publication of this cartoon would make the negotiations for Miss Smith's release more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In January of this year, I visited Bangkok once again to assess progress on Miss Smith's application for a royal pardon. I was granted a second audience at the Royal Palace with the King's principal private secretary. In the course of our conversation the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> cartoon was mentioned by the principal private secretary, and it was clear that the Thais had taken the matter quite seriously. I could well understand their deep concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to read from parts of the records which I made after my visit to the palace. Again I refer to the Australian prisoner as Mary Smith, although that is not her real name:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Principal Private Secretary raised the matter of the "Age" cartoon which the Thais regarded as offensive. I indicated that I, too, was disturbed, but outlined that we do not control the press and considered that nothing would be gained by speaking to the newspaper concerned. I stated that Mary Smith wanted no publicity and I would do what I could to see that nothing adverse would appear on her release. He said he appreciated that and would pass it on to the King.</PARA>
<PARA>The cable which was drafted and sent to Australia by the embassy officer who had accompanied me was perhaps a little more expansive. In part it read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Principal Private Secretary raised his concern over a newspaper report about a recent Royal Pardon granted to an Australian prisoner jailed on drug trafficking charges. He said the media article had embarrassed the Thai authorities concerned. The Principal Private Secretary appeared to be signalling his concern about the possibility that such an embarrassing situation could happen again, should a Royal Pardon be granted to Smith, who was convicted on similar charges. Senator Colston indicated that he, too, had been embarrassed by the press coverage and had considered writing to the newspaper concerned. He had rejected this idea, however, fearing that such a letter could lead to an escalation of the matter. Senator Colston stated that the Australia press is not subject to direction by the government. He expressed his confidence that the Smiths would not provide any comment to the media, should Ms Smith be granted a Royal Pardon. ML Thawisan said that he would advise His Majesty the King accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA>When Miss Smith returned to Australia in July, there was so much media interest in her case that it was necessary to make a statement to the media. The statement issued by the Smiths read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are extremely grateful to His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej for granting a Royal Pardon and allowing us to resume a normal family life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other than that, we will be making no further comments to media representatives and we believe that at this time our privacy should be respected</PARA>
<PARA>The message which I wish to convey is that we should totally respect the cultural differences between ourselves and other countries. We can do this only if we make an effort to understand those differences. It is in this regard that I make a plea to the media to gain this understanding and be aware of the respect which should be afforded to our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had hoped that the offensive cartoon would eventually be regarded as an unfortunate incident in the past. But I was not counting on the abject insensitivity of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>. Running a story earlier this month about the Thais' refusal to grant visas to two Australian journalists, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> reproduced the offensive cartoon. I just do not know how insensitive some people in a responsible position can be and, if I were a prisoner in a Thai prison, especially if I had applied for a royal pardon, I would be extremely angry at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>'s failure to understand the Thais' justifiable offence at the cartoon. I would realise that my application for a pardon would be considered against a background of the further offending reference to His Majesty the King. I sincerely express my embarrassment as an Australian to the Thai authorities over the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>'s actions. I hope that the Thais will understand that the press in this country is not subject to government direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that some sections of our media need to devote more time to understand the way of life of our geographic neighbours. If they do that and, having understood, I would hope that they do not act as cultural philistines but, rather, respect our neighbours to the north. The Australian media has a powerful influence within our country. However, its influence extends beyond our shores and, properly used, it can cement good relations with other nations. If, in the future, any media representatives are tempted to show how clever they are by lampooning some aspect of another nation's culture, I would hope that they would think of the possible consequences and extend the same courtesy as we would expect from others. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is well known that this country is one of the great migrant countries of the world. People have come to this nation from far and wide to receive the benefits that Australia has to offer. They come here because they recognise that this country is better than the country which they have chosen to leave. Yet it alarms me that there are people who propose to change one of the fundamental strengths of this nation&mdash;to change its constitutional arrangements. In so doing, I believe that we run the risk of lessening one of the great democracies of this world. The problem is this: those who propose change, who wish to bring about a republic in this nation, arm themselves with arguments which are weak in comparison to the reasons why this nation has enjoyed so much stability and peace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me run through for honourable senators the arguments which have been proposed by those who support a republic in these shores. The arguments can basically be boiled down to three. The first is that they believe that Australia should have an Australian head of state. The second reason they espouse is that we should become a republic to become more like our neighbours in Asia. The third reason which is advanced is that we should somehow become a republic because the current constitutional arrangements are irrelevant to a nation of increasingly ethnic diverse population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal with each of those three points in order. The fact is that we do have an Australian head of state&mdash;an Australian head of state both in title and in effect. The constitution of this nation says very clearly that the Queen is the head of state as Queen of Australia. In fact, it is interesting that that title, the style of that title, was conferred on the Queen by an act of parliament under a Labor government. It was not under a coalition government but under a Labor government&mdash;in fact, under the Labor government of the Hon. Gough Whitlam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queen is Queen of Australia and, as Queen of Australia, she is not queen of any other nation. We are not beholden to Westminster, to the UK, to whatever might happen in the House of Commons. The destiny of this nation is determined here, in this place, in this parliament. Those who say that our current constitutional arrangements show that we are not a truly sovereign and independent nation do an injustice to this parliament. They do an injustice to the institution of the Senate and to the institution of the House of Representatives, because it is here, within these walls, that the future of our nation is decided by Australians and for Australians, and no amount of saying otherwise will change that simple fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is spurious indeed that those who propose a republic say that we have to have a republic to become a sovereign and independent nation. In fact, a leading republican proponent, Mr Barry Jones, said, in the House of Representatives in 1987 after the passage of the Australia Act, that, with the passage of the Australia Act, Australia was finally a sovereign and independent nation. This is a matter of fact; it is a matter of record. Yet, Mr Barry Jones and other republicans now seek to change their views on this issue. Of course, the fact is that Australia is independent under our current constitutional arrangements and will always remain so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The titular head of Australia, the Governor-General, is an Australian by virtue of the constitution. People who have recently criticised the Governor-General for his trip to Turkey had to concede the fact that the Governor-General went to Turkey, to Gallipoli, as head of state&mdash;as the effective Australian head of state&mdash;and he is recognised as such around the world. For those same people to say that, for some reason, we are considered overseas to be something less than independent is to be less than honest with the facts. The facts are these: Australia is seen around the world as a nation beholden to nobody. It is the cringe of the republican movement which does damage to this nation's sovereignty and independence, not our current constitutional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The republicans then trot out their next argument. They say that we have to be a republic so that we can be part of South-East Asia or part of Asia. This is a very interesting argument because it is not an argument that you hear republicans and the government espousing when they go to Japan and meet with the emperor. It is not an argument that you find republicans espousing when they go to Thailand and meet with the king. It is not an argument that you find republicans espousing in Malaysia or Brunei. In fact, earlier this year, I shared a very pleasant evening: a dinner with Senator Gareth Evans and the sister of the Sultan of Brunei. It would have been spurious for Senator Gareth Evans to say that Australia wanted to become a republic to be more like the people in Brunei, and I think he recognised this. The facts are that, in what we loosely call Asia, there are as many constitutional monarchies as there are republics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is this: in which system would one prefer to live? I think that most Australians would recognise that they would much rather enjoy the freedom that we have under our constitutional monarchy than live in places such as North Korea, the People's Republic of China or that other great bastion of human rights and civil liberties, Indonesia. The facts are that, within our region, it is the republics which are the least tolerant of nations and which have the least respect for the rights of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, that is why my family came to this country from China. My grandfather, who was a republican in China and supported the KMT, suddenly found, having got his republic, that he did not get the republic he wanted. And this is one of the great dangers. So it was to Australia that our family fled, to enjoy the freedoms that this nation has to offer under the provisions of our constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when republicans espouse their third great argument for a republic&mdash;that this nation is increasingly more ethnically diverse&mdash;they miss the point as to why people choose to come to this country after all. In many cases, people come to this country from republics overseas because this constitutional monarchy offers better protections than they received in their former home, which was a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Isn't it a wonderful thing that the constitution of our nation can be perceived around the world as a protector of freedom and as a protector of the rights of individuals? We should think of these things with our heads held high, remembering that this has been achieved through enormous sacrifice and has resulted in enormous tolerance, and that one of the great dangers of republics&mdash;at least republics in our region&mdash;has been that republics have failed to respect the rights of individuals. That is why I say that it is foolish indeed of the republican movement to assume that, because people come from different ethnic backgrounds, they are going to come to this country and want to change this country into a republic. In many instances they have come to this country from a republic because of the benefits that our constitutional monarchy offers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two problems that republicans have to answer: how will the republic work; and, secondly, how can it make this democratic nation any more democratic than it is at the moment? Republicans will tell you that it is going to be very easy to appoint the president. The president, they say, is going to be appointed by two-thirds of the parliament sitting together. What a wonderful suggestion. It is wonderful until one remembers the fact that the House of Representatives and the Senate cannot even agree on mutual times for lunch, let alone who would be the head of state. What an absurd situation. At best, two-thirds of parliament would be in agreement between whoever happened to be Prime Minister and whoever happened to be the Leader of the Opposition. And 80 per cent of Australians who say that they would like a republic want a republic only if they get the chance to determine who will be the president. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is the delicious irony: the republican movement says to ordinary Australians, `We want your support. We want to have a mass movement to change the constitution'&mdash;and it does require a mass movement to change the constitution&mdash;`We want your support to make this country a republic, to have an elected head of state. We want you to vote in a referendum to achieve that change. But, having achieved that change, we don't trust you to choose who will be the president.' That is the delicious irony. The people who say, `We want your vote. We want your trust to change the constitution,' are also saying to those same people who support them, `But we don't trust you to elect the president.' That is why republicanism will fail in this country: it does not make the system more democratic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if you could get two-thirds of both houses to elect a president, there are enormous problems that flow from the power of that parliament to sack a president. If a parliament can make, a parliament can unmake. Let us not forget that the Governor-General, as the Queen's representative, is the protector, not of the opposition from the government, but of the people from the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suppose a situation arose in which both sides of parliament decided they were going to gag the media because they did not like the media running stories about politicians expenses, the bill duly passed parliament, it went to the president and the president refused to sign. What happens then? The same two-thirds that got together and voted the bill through parliament could get together and vote to sack the president to have their way. The president, of course, could always dissolve parliament. What happens? Who determines who has priority? Is it the president's writ of dissolution, or is it the vote of the same two-thirds of the parliament that appointed the president and want to close down the criticism by the media of the politicians? Which is it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Republicanism, in this fashion, offers only one thing, and that is the constant threat of constitutional crisis. This is the grave failing of the republican case. They cannot make this system any more democratic than it is because, in truth, the only great power held by the Governor-General is the power, in the event of crisis, to dissolve the parliament and return the parliamentarians to answer to the people. Nothing could be more democratic than that. Anything else means that, at a time of crisis, the ultimate decision does not lie with the people but lies with some self-elected or self-appointed elite. In truth, the great challenge for our constitution in the future is to make the constitution more democratic, not to erode the fundamental strengths that make this nation a great democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I say to those in the republican movement that their contribution to discussion is welcome but they must, to have the support of the Australian people, offer an alternative which is truly democratic, and not merely an excuse to entrench the power of a self-elected oligopoly. This nation is one of the greatest nations in the world and we tamper with those freedoms at our risk. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak today on the subject of Western Australian industrial relations legislation, in particular what is referred to as the first wave of industrial legislation introduced by the Court Liberal government. In doing so, I want to continue some remarks I commenced last night in the adjournment debate, which go to the detailing of workers' experiences in Western Australia under that legislation. I do so because I think the relevance is obvious. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr John Howard, is on the record as indicating his support for that legislation and saying that the policy applied in Western Australia would form the basis of federal policy. On 28 July 1995, Mr Howard said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to see throughout Australia an industrial relations system that is largely similar to what the coalition government has implemented in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>He later said in parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I said that I supported the laws that had already been enacted in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I make it clear here that Mr Howard was referring to the first wave of IR legislation, and that is also the subject of my discussion today. Last night, I detailed a comparison of the workplace agreement put in place at TAFE colleges in Western Australia for cleaners employed by Linfoot Cleaning Services, comparing that to their old award. For the subject of today's contribution, I will refer to that as workplace agreement A. I want to provide for the Senate today details of comparisons of further workplace agreements and the relevant award. I have sought leave of the opposition whip to incorporate these documents entitled `Workplace agreements B, C, D and E'. I seek leave to incorporate those documents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and thank you, Senator O'Chee. These documents provide a comparison of the relevant workplace agreements and awards covering the workers described in the documents. They relate to people in Western Australia employed in a cleaning capacity and to people employed in the baking industry. I hope to table further such examples in coming weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not at this stage tabled the actual workplace agreement because there are extreme secrecy provisions in the Western Australian legislation surrounding the disclosure of workplace agreements. There are also penalties involved with disclosing details of workplace agreements. The matter that most concerns me is that the individual workers who have provided those documents to the persons who have then forwarded them to me need to be protected. I will, at a later stage, seek leave to table those particular workplace agreements but I first have to make sure that there is no way of identifying the particular workers involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workplace agreements that I have just incorporated highlight a number of things. The first is that, under the regime of industrial relations established by the Court Liberal government in Western Australia, workers have been forced into casual employment contracts. This has been done because the legislation provides that a worker employed on a casual contract is not protected by the minimum conditions of employment legislation. So no minimums apply to a worker employed on a contract that is defined as casual contract. To be defined as a casual contract all that is required is for a worker not to be entitled to paid annual leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It used to be the case when I was an industrial relations practitioner that casual employment was defined by the short-term nature of the employment. A casual was someone employed for less than a week or less than a month under a particular award. But, under the Western Australian industrial relations legislation, thousands of workers have been reclassified from being permanent full-time or permanent part-time to being casuals. Therefore, under the Western Australian industrial relations legislation, they are only entitled to protection for the payment of a minimum wage and for an entitlement to bereavement leave. They are not entitled to paid annual leave. They are not entitled to paid sick leave and they are not entitled to any of the other normal conditions that have been built up in awards in this country over the last hundred years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These things mean that a worker, having served 10 or 15 years as an employee of a firm, and because they continue to be defined as casual, can be entitled to long service leave but not entitled to annual leave. They have no protection. The Liberal Party rhetoric about protecting people's minimums and protecting their conditions is a hollow claim. These agreements detail how workers are being classified as casual and therefore exposed to an individual contract with their employer that provides no minimums other than the minimum wage and an entitlement to bereavement leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of these contracts, and the further ones that I shall introduce into the chamber in coming weeks, is that of wage rates. On first glance, the wage rates contained in the workplace agreements appear to be comparable with those in the award. They are designed, in my view, so as to look competitive in order to attract labour. They are also designed in this way, on the recommendation of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, to give some credibility to workplace agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what one must understand, and what these comparisons highlight, is that most of these workplace agreements do not provide for penalty payments or for overtime. Some of them provide that ordinary hours are up to 70 hours per week, without payment of any penalties. If a worker is taken sick, there is no entitlement for sick leave and there is no paid annual leave. The contracts provide that if a worker wants to take annual leave they need the permission of the employer and it has to be unpaid annual leave. This could be a worker who has been working for five, 10 or 15 years for that one employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, in a lot of these industries, Third World employment conditions are being introduced into Australia, conditions that we legislated to prevent in the early part of this century, when we set up the conciliation and arbitration commissions and the award system in Australia. The total package that these workers are receiving is significantly less than the package they would have received under the award. Workers are significantly worse off not just in monetary terms at the end of the week by virtue of their pay packet but also in terms of their lack of entitlement to sick leave, annual leave and those other conditions that we, as Australian workers, have accepted as being basic minima, as basic to the standard of living and the social cohesion in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workers in WA receive no protection from the minimum conditions of employment act because, by merely defining a worker as casual, even if they are working 38 or 40 hours per week, working 52 weeks of the year and have been employed for five, 10 or 15 years, they have no protection as to minimum conditions, as I say, other than the minimum wage and an entitlement to bereavement leave. Clearly, the workers are worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem is that employers who employ under individual workplace agreements are at a comparative advantage to other employers. We are seeing the erosion of the award system and the safety net provided. For instance, a contract cleaner is paying under the award and a competitor is paying under an individual workplace agreement. The individual workplace agreement provides for significantly lower return to the worker and, therefore, significantly lower total cost to the employer, hence he has a comparative advantage. The competitor can gain the contract&mdash;for instance, a cleaning contract&mdash;because he can keep his costs lower. He would be rewarding and paying his employees considerably less, therefore, he can tender at a lower contract price. The award system is being eroded by these workplace agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a nonsense to claim that the award system is a safety net, because the award system will eventually be totally eroded by the ability of employers to pay what they like. That is, effectively, the situation in Western Australia because there is no protection from the minimum conditions of employment act. There is no disadvantage test. There is no safety net in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a third issue that I want to refer to, and this becomes clear from the examples that I have incorporated. Effectively, a worker has no choice in Western Australia about signing a workplace agreement. The union claim of sign or resign, or sign or refuse the job, has been proved by the experience in the last two years in Western Australia. Ian Viner QC provided a legal opinion to the Trades and Labour Council when the legislation was being debated in the WA parliament, which made it clear that, in his view, the legislation provided no protection for workers and no protection from the superior bargaining power of employers. His legal opinion has been vindicated by the experience of Western Australian workers. There is no choice and no protection. There is no choice when you are employed. For instance, recently, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, an industrial commissioner, a former employers' industrial advocate, advertised for an associate to work with him in his position as an industrial commissioner with the WA industrial relations commission. He offered a workplace agreement. If people want a job working with the industrial commissioner, they have to sign a workplace agreement. If you were the best person for the job, there was no choice about whether you were going to be able to choose the award or the workplace agreement. You had to sign the workplace agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, the examples I have incorporated prove that workers are being dismissed if they refuse to sign workplace agreements. Workers are under enormous pressure to sign. They know it is a matter of sign or resign. We have instances of workers having been sacked for their refusal to sign or for their attempt to involve the protection of the award or the protection of their union. The only thing that is protecting some workers currently in Western Australia is the fact that their unions are seeking federal award coverage as protection from these workplace agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth issue arising from these examples that I want to address today is the role that the Chamber of Commerce and Industry is now playing in Western Australian industrial relations practice. We are aware that the minister has given himself the power to set the minimum wage, independent of any recommendation of the industrial relations commissioner. He has given himself the power to remove awards and to remove the right of unions to represent workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has also given the Chamber of Commerce and Industry enormous powers. What is occurring is that the Chamber of Commerce and Industry is advising its members of the ability to employ people as casuals and therefore avoid the minimum conditions under the employment acts. They are advising and encouraging members to take out workplace agreements, to employ members as casuals and to set their own wage rates and conditions. Because there is no protection from the legislation, the chamber is able to advise employers what rates and conditions should apply. Employers can ignore that advice but most of them seem to be pursuing the chamber's advice and are using standard contracts drawn up by the chamber where all they have to do is write in the employer's name, the employee's name and a couple of other details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry is driving wage rates and conditions down to minimums that they consider to be appropriate to be paid. They have completely eroded the role of the industrial commission as the independent arbitrator of wages and conditions in Western Australia. Because individual contracts provide no protection for workers, the employer, with the advice of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, sets the wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that has occurred is that they even have the gall, as shown in workplace agreement E, to nominate the Chamber of Commerce and Industry as the arbitrator of any dispute between the worker and the employer. Not only does the chamber advise and help draw up the contract that sets the wages and conditions but, if the worker is brave or stupid enough to dispute it, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry will appoint an independent arbitrator, not the industrial commissioner. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry says that not only will it set wages and conditions but, if people have any concern about that, they will nominate the arbiter to arbitrate any disputes under the workplace agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, what the government has done is privatise the industrial commission's role and, in effect, has given it to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia. It is another step in their privatisation process. It is clear that the rhetoric of the Liberal Party in Western Australia and the rhetoric of John Howard in the parliament do not match the reality of people's working lives in Western Australia and do not match the reality of what is occurring to people working under workplace agreements in Western Australia. </PARA>

There is a very important point in that report which is that the committee is identifying and formulating long-term strategies such as the form, content and format of a draft constitution, reviewing the desired procedure for the adoption of a Northern Territory constitution and other issues relating to eventual statehood, including a possible timetable for the re-establishment of public awareness programs to Northern Territory urban centres, Aboriginal and remote communities. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the exposure draft of a new constitution for the Northern Territory is vitally important. I again commend to the Senate the tabling statement in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on 22 June 1995 by the Attorney-General, the Hon. Steve Hatton, who is also chairman of the Sessional Committee on Constitutional Development of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I could highlight one point of Mr Hatton's tabling statement, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recognises there will be no major constitutional development in the Northern Territory without the support and recognition of the basic rights of Aboriginal people. However, there is a concern in Aboriginal society, which values its various indigenous cultural circumstances, particularly land rights, sacred sites and customary law, the concern being that these rights should be constitutionally protected, otherwise they could be at risk after statehood.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can refer to what Warren Snowdon, the Northern Territory's federal member, told Darwin radio on 9 June this year, he said that statehood was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . incidental to the process of getting to a republic and that's been made very clear.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet a news poll shows that two-thirds of territorians want both issues, statehood and the republic, resolved within the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of Mr Snowdon's colleagues, the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Mr Kim Beazley, stepped up Labor's anti-statehood campaign when he visited Darwin in August. He warned that the Northern Territory could suffer financially as a result of statehood. I disagree with him. But in comments reminiscent of Labor's scare tactics in the early 1970s&mdash;the pre-self government days&mdash;Mr Beazley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You could not sit down with the other states and justify the level of subsidy in per capita here if statehood had actually been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>That was on a radio station in Darwin on 19 August 1995. The reality is that the Northern Territory receives a higher level of funding, not because of its constitutional status but because of factors such as distance, population dispersion and the pressing need of people in remote areas and Aboriginal communities. Clearly, Mr Beazley did not read his own departmental brief on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's approach to statehood is in stark contrast to that of the Liberal and National parties in the federal coalition. John Howard, the opposition leader, gave a commitment in June this year to list Northern Territory statehood on the agenda of the people's convention in 1997. That convention will review the Australian constitution and consider new issues such as territory statehood. In other words, unlike Prime Minister Keating, John Howard has given territorians a firm commitment to address statehood in the context of discussions on the Australian constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also important to note that, at the opening of the new Parliament House in Darwin on 31 August 1994, there were a number of very important statements made by the Governor-General, Bill Hayden, and of course others, including the then Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron. Let me quote from what Mr Perron said on that occasion:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our sixteen year period of self-rule, the Territory has prospered despite the external constitutional constraints which have blocked many of our development options.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continued existence of this one-sixth of all Australia as a Territory constitutionally inferior to the States is an anachronism.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, it must be addressed and it must be addressed soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that today the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, in its annual report, has commented that an agreement was struck at the Council of Australian Governments in April 1995 for the establishment of a working group of Commonwealth and Northern Territory officials to consider the implications of a possible grant of statehood to the Northern Territory and that this working group is being chaired by the secretary to that department and is to report to the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory by December 1995. The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has made no commitment as to any particular outcome of this process.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what disturbs me. There is an undercurrent by the Labor administration in Canberra that does not reflect the priorities of the Labor Party and certainly the Country-Liberal Party in the Northern Territory. I hope that it will now gather a lot more enthusiasm and support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and quite discrete and separate issue that I want to address today relates to a proposal for the establishment of a cooperative research centre that will look very much at the issues of renewable energy and greenhouse gas abatement technologies. Research capabilities and market knowledge combine in this proposal as a world class centre for the development and commercialisation of renewable energy systems which will minimise greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CRC proposal focuses on ecologically sustainable development in a practical way, especially in outback Australia, including Western Australia, the Northern Territory, outback New South Wales and Queensland. Thus it will benefit Aboriginal communities, pastoralists and remote off grid communities, remote mining communities and all Australians as the benefits will flow eventually to urban communities and export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without losing the export focus, the CRC includes the best and most innovative researches in renewable energy systems from other parts of Australia. It is proposed that there will be 26 participants, including nine from Perth and five from Darwin. Other national linkages come from Canberra, Broken Hill, Alice Springs, Sydney, Newcastle and Brisbane, and major utilities from Western Australia, the Northern Territory and New South Wales. A strong group of private sector innovators joins in this CRC to ensure research benefits flow through into the economy. It is Perth based, and this reflects the growing renewables research and development centre of excellence based at Murdoch University. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World class innovation and technology transfer to the Asia-Pacific markets are hallmarks of this proposal. Discussions have already begun with Asia-Pacific interests to develop an export culture for the CRC and to open up cooperation for demonstration projects and market opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CRC is strongly supported by the Western Australian and Northern Territory governments, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and the private sector, and this reflects its remote area focus and the official recognition of the CRC's high quality research team and strong organisation and its commitment to demonstration and commercialisation of the products of research. This CRC shows that not everything new and exciting in Australia or in Australian science needs to be located on the east coast of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a gathering together of important groups from academia, whether it is from Murdoch University, the Australian National University,  Curtin University, the CSIRO, the Northern Territory University&mdash;in particular, the centre for energy studies&mdash;the University of Queensland, the University of Newcastle and the University of Technology in Sydney. This is linked with a dozen or so companies from the private sector with major power energy areas and is supported, as I said before, by various other sectors, including the governments of Western Australia and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know from discussions with my colleagues in the Northern Territory government that their agencies have been experimenting with renewables for remote community services since l978, when the first solar water pumping systems were commissioned in Aboriginal communities. Now over 150 solar water pumping systems have been installed to provide remote Aboriginal communities in the Territory with their water supplies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to l990 the use of renewables for electricity generation was not economic and the Northern Territory program for improving its electricity generation performance was based on the introduction of natural-gas fired plant and the latest technology at that time for combined cycle power generation plant. This led to the Power and Water Authority of the Northern Territory becoming the lowest contributor of CO2 of any state utilities that depend on fossil fuels for generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last five years new and emerging technologies have changed the situation so that we now have a number of cost effective applications of renewable energy generation being demonstrated. However, the successes are still limited to niche applications, where care has been taken to design a system that accurately reflects the circumstances of the community being supplied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A framework that provides for integrating emerging technologies for renewable energy generation systems with community circumstances so as to stimulate a market pull environment is lacking. The territory experience indicates that this component of the commercialisation process must be improved before the potential outback market, much less the enormous markets in developing countries, can be accessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons, a `systems' cooperative research centre is viewed by the Northern Territory government as being essential to the problem of providing equitable levels of service to remote outback communities and to the development of a competitive Australian renewable energy electricity generation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CRC structure provided by the Northern Territory-Western Australian bid is designed to focus Australian renewable energy research and development so that it meets contemporary needs for clean power as efficiently as possible, in the process helping to further reduce the amount of CO2 generated by the electricity supply industry. Involvement of the north Australian utilities, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, the Centre for Appropriate Technology and the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation Centre for Applications of Solar Energy provides this consortium from Western Australia and the Northern Territory with the tools needed to successfully enhance and commercialise Australia's impressive renewable energy research and development agenda. The international program as outlined in the bid is in itself an exciting prospect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the consortium behind the bid have been collaborating for several years and there is every reason to believe that the timely support for this process provided by the CRC will enhance the benefits of this collaboration for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would certainly commend this proposal and believe it should enjoy the support of the federal government. I would  link it to the first issue I addressed today, that of the progress constitutionally of the Northern Territory to statehood.

I refer to the dangerous increase in inflation in the September quarter, as measured by both the CPI and the underlying rate.

Will he also confirm that the underlying inflation rate is now above the upper level of the range that the Reserve Bank considers tolerable and acceptable?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do you want to deny that? Underlying inflation remains consistent with the official target to average between two and three per cent over the economic cycle. Underlying CPI rose 1.2 per cent in the September quarter and by 3.1 per cent through the year to the September quarter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underlying inflation rate gives a better indication of inflationary pressures in the economy than the headline inflation rate. However, it is still influenced by one-off factors. The September quarter in part reflected one-off factors such as the increase in wholesale sales tax announced in the 1993-94 budget, which came into effect on 1 July, and the flow-on effects of the increase in the wholesale sales tax on cars in the June quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Headline inflation also reflects the impact of these one-off factors. The measures of price movements in the national accounts confirm that inflation remains low and under control. The non-farm GDP deflator, a broader measure of inflation in the economy than the CPI, rose 2.1 per cent through the year to the June quarter. The annual increase in the non-farm GDP deflator has remained below 2 1/2 per cent for 15 quarters&mdash;that is, since the December quarter 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the continuing prospect of inflation remaining low is good. As noted in the Reserve Bank's October bulletin, underlying inflation was expected to increase over the year to be a little greater than three per cent. The current growth in underlying inflation is consistent with the official target to average between two and three per cent over the economic cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank notes that the current monetary policy settings are consistent with the projected trends in growth and inflation. The budget forecast of underlying inflation is 3 1/4 per cent in 1995-96 and four per cent for headline inflation. This is consistent with the Reserve Bank's target for inflation. The expected increase in underlying inflation in 1995-96 is less than we have seen in this last stage of the economic cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that we have gone through 16 quarters of growth. The last time the mob opposite were in power they not only had a recession but also had inflation at 11.4 per cent in the middle of the recession. They try to lecture us on controlling inflation.

Will he also confirm that coming out of the worst recession in Australia in 60 years, which this government imposed on this country, and before any significant recovery in terms of living standards occurs, we now face the worst of all possible worlds of rising inflation, falling economic growth, rising unemployment and inflationary pressures on interest rates?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to advise the Senate that the government has accepted a recommendation from Wool International that it conduct a limited two-year program to develop and evaluate the forward marketing of wool. The proposed program builds on Wool International's efforts to stimulate the development of a broader range of risk management options for the sale of wool as required under its act. The wool industry has only limited commercial risk management options presently available to it, and of course the losers in that regard are the growers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent volatility in the market demonstrates the need to utilise such instruments to better manage risk. The program does not presuppose any privatisation of Wool International. As I have said before, that will depend on the decisions taken by individual growers as to whether they wish to take equity in any privatisation of Wool International or, indeed, take cash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to stress that this forward marketing operation will be completely independent of the stockpile sales, which will continue according to the fixed schedule. The program will be conducted through Wool International's subsidiary, Wool International Holdings. It will be conducted separately from the ongoing activities of Wool International whose prime responsibility is to manage the stockpile disposal and to discharge the industry debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program will be conducted on strictly commercial terms. Wool International Holdings will only have access to the stockpile on the same commercial basis as any other industry participant. Wool International Holdings will be subject to all the requirements of Corporations Law and all forms of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other key points regarding this program are: it will be a stand-alone commercial operation with a two year time frame commencing in 1996; it will be funded from revenue received from the management of non-wool assets as provided for in the existing legislation; no government guarantee is involved; and it will be subject to rigorous risk management requirements. Wool International Holdings will also have separate and transparent accounting. I have also asked the board of Wool International to provide me with quarterly progress reports on the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current circumstances in the wool market highlight the need for better risk management tools for the industry. Wool International has been developing this proposal for some time in direct consultation with an industry contact group. It considered that the development of improved risk management techniques for the benefit of growers was running at a snail's [ace and it needed some impetus. We agreed. After considering the matter, and with the support, I might add, of the executive of the Wool Council, I have agreed to Wool International conducting a limited forward trading operation. I intend to introduce legislation into the current session of the parliament to give effect to this decision.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Bolkus. Last night you announced that the government would increase its humanitarian program for the financial year to a total of 15,000 places. What are the reasons behind this decision and how will Australia's response assist the international efforts to assist refugees from the conflict in the former Yugoslavia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2486" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murphy is right. We have increased our humanitarian program for this financial year. The driving factor for it, the reason for it, has been the situation in the former Yugoslavia&mdash;a situation which has led to a large increase in the number of refugees from that area and a situation which, I must say, has attracted the concern, I think, of all Australians, particularly as they see the plight of individuals from the former Yugoslavia night after night on TV news reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the outset of this conflict, Australia has been keen to assist the international community in a number of ways. We have done so in terms of aid and we have done so in offering people displaced by the conflict the chance to build new lives in a peaceful and secure environment. I was pleased last night to be able to announce a decision of cabinet that the government had decided to offer some 2,000 extra places in our humanitarian program this financial year for refugees and displaced persons from the former Yugoslavia. I think it was an extremely appropriate way also to mark UN Day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional 2,000 places, which will be brought forward from the 1996-97 program, will mean that our humanitarian program will offer offshore resettlement to a total of 15,000 people from around the world this year and, together with that, close to 2,000 people will obtain refugee status onshore as well. It will bring the number of former Yugoslav nationals arriving here as humanitarian entrants this financial year from 5,650 to more than 7,600, which is just more than half of our total program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Murphy asked the reasons for this decision. They do go directly to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. In July this year, for instance, the UNHCR launched an international appeal for countries to provide an extra 5,000 resettlement or temporary protection places. On 14 October, in response to new developments in the region gravely affecting a new group of refugees, the UNHCR had to revise its figures and appealed for a further 20,000 places in 1995 and another 25,000 places in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been responsive to the situation. We value our close relationship with the UNHCR. We have been keen to respond to this appeal without disadvantaging those in need from other parts of the world, particularly the Middle East and Africa, and our own region. All up, those who have come to Australia this financial year will join 14,000 people who arrived from the former Yugoslavia region as humanitarian entrants since 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important aspect, as I announced last night, is that people who have come here and who will be coming here will come under the three components of our multifaceted humanitarian program: the refugee program, the humanitarian program and the special assistance category. This comes on top of the $3 million of additional aid to this region, which the Prime Minister announced quite recently. Together, the responses amount to a major commitment on behalf of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on the record that the UNHCR has recognised Australia's position. I will table a letter in a few minutes. I indicate that they appreciate what Australia has been doing, particularly at a time when other governments were becoming more restrictive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Australian humanitarian program is an important part of our response to international distress situations. We have the highest per capita program in the world. It is flexible and can respond to situations like this only because of the commitment and support of so many people in the Australian community. Volunteers, church based organisations and the like assist people. Together with government, they provide the most comprehensive settlement program of any country in the world in respect of people in distress.

The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald </EMPHASIS>has reported that in New South Wales parents are being forced to pay $43 million for what are described as voluntary fees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recollect that debate. First of all, decisions about levels of school fees for government schools are matters for state and territory governments. The key issue is not whether parents are prepared to pay such fees&mdash;recent press reports indicate that most appear to be prepared to do so&mdash;but whether the imposition of such fees creates hardship for disadvantaged students. There is also the question of what effect these fees might have on student decisions about choosing subjects and continuing on to year 12.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These issues have been raised recently by both Senator Bell and  parent and student groups to Minister Crean and Minister Free.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Carr for his question on what has been a complex issue of some controversy over the last year or so in this industry. First of all I should explain that a multi-site franchise, sometimes called a retail area franchise, is essentially a franchise where one dealer operates a number of sites. I am advised that the Mobil company has about five in what it would consider a multi-site and the Shell company has around 20.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the argument in the industry on this issue, you have the views of the petrol retailers and franchisees, particularly the Shell National Action Group, which is made up of retailers, and which argues that such moves to multi-site franchising arrangements will have a range of outcomes which they believe will be negative. They argue that a multi-site franchise is anti-competitive in that it allows a single dealer to effectively determine a retail price in that market area. They also claim that in many cases the multi-site franchise operator is financed by the franchisor and that the latter has a de facto control over the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The oil companies' view is quite different. The oil companies argue that moves towards MSF are a necessary part of restructuring in the industry which will lead to greater efficiencies, higher levels of training and service and greater profitability. The Trade Practices Commission has announced that they are currently investigating this issue and are likely to form a view in the near future. My view is that it is essential that the key players in this dispute in the industry have an opportunity to argue their case openly in the public interest. Accordingly, I have referred this matter to the House of Representatives industry committee for consideration and advice. I will meet with the chairman, Mr Griffiths, to arrange the terms of reference for such an inquiry. That will give both sides a chance to argue their case and the public can judge the merits of the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also called on today the companies to have a moratorium on the further development of multi-site franchising at least until the Trade Practices Commission comes down with a considered view. The introduction of MSF at the moment has affected the completion of an agreement on a voluntary oil code between the franchisees and the petrol companies. That petrol code, substantially agreed upon, would be of major benefit to both sides of the industry and would enhance the building of trust within the industry, but unfortunately a number of the retailers' interests believe that MSF at the same time means that they are not quite certain exactly what is going to be the outcome of such a code. Therefore, I believe it would be in the interests of the industry overall if there were a moratorium, at least until the Trades Practices Commission comes down with its view. In the meantime I believe it is important that both sides of the industry, where there is considerable controversy on this issue, have a chance to put their views publicly, which they will be able to do before the House of Representatives industry committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also on behalf of the government urge both sides of this industry to reach as soon as possible an agreement on a new voluntary petroleum code, which is much needed by this very important industry in the Australian economy.</PARA>

But today we learn that Mr Keating believes that because the Labor government has given $6 billion in tax concessions to the superannuation industry it has, to use his words, `heaps of prerogative over how the industry is run'. In fact, Mr Keating said: `Where are the greater prerogatives in this than in the hands of the Prime Minister' and further adds, `or in the hands of the trade unions?'

I take that as an encouragement in regulatory legislation to look beyond the horizon of one year to the medium-term future. That is an encouragement device, as opposed to directing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I do not expect the issue of trade and labour standards to be on the agenda for Osaka. You referred to social clauses, Senator Spindler. This is an idea that arose from a misapprehension. We have something which you could call social clauses&mdash;it is not a title I would give it&mdash;in NAFTA. There is debate about one in the WTO. These are formal agreements of treaty or similar type into which people enter. This is not what we are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In APEC there is no such proposal for a formal binding agreement into which people enter and where everybody signs a treaty or type of agreement. It is really an indication of shared commitment and coordinated voluntary actions by governments. So we will not have clauses in that sense because it is not that sort of agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, your other point, with regard to the subcommittee, is important because it raises issues to do with labour standards and environment being considered in APEC. Yes, they are being considered but not by one separate compartmentalised committee. There are a number of committees looking at issues to do with human resources and strategies to improve workers' conditions, training, education of workers, et cetera, in the various APEC working groups, particularly the human resources development working group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also APEC bodies, such as the energy working group and the tourism working group both of which I am advised are looking at environmental aspects of APEC. Of course, the APEC environment ministers meet regularly to discuss environment issues within the region. I do not think we should compartmentalise it off into one separate committee that only looks at those issues. But they are matters that are being considered by some of the existing working groups, and I imagine that will continue to be the case.</PARA>

In her question Senator Chamarette asked if it was true that my predecessor, Mrs Kelly, had written to Pasminco informing it that no future extensions of the licence would occur. In a supplementary question Senator Chamarette asked me to table all correspondence between Minister Kelly and Pasminco regarding the dumping licence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the letter that Senator Chamarette was referring to is Mrs Kelly's letter advising Pasminco of the granting of a sea-dumping permit for the period from 1 November 1991 to 31 October 1995. I table that letter. This letter makes it quite clear that the government was seeking to end sea dumping as soon as possible. The letter also expresses Mrs Kelly's wish to set an agreed date for the cessation of sea dumping. It does not state that no further licences would be issued, as I think was suggested by Senator Chamarette in her question.</PARA>

The third point I wanted her to address was the fact that, under the current metal trades industry award&mdash;clause 9 of the award, if you want to know&mdash;the current unskilled minimum weekly wage rate is $238.10, which is $79 less than the WA minimum. It is well worth mentioning the fact that under Queensland law they have a minimum rate of $250 a week, which is some $67 less than the situation which exists in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, as I have said before, is one of the most deceitful efforts ever by this government in misleading the Australian public as to what a situation is. In putting these ads together, they have obviously not even bothered to look at the history of just Western Australia. If we look at Western Australia, we find very clearly that since 1987, when Brian Burke was Premier of Western Australia, the minimum wage has been coming down consistently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, if we go back to 4 January 1980, when Sir Charles Court was Premier, we find that that particular minimum wage was at its highest then. It was not until the Liberal Court government was elected in Western Australia on 20 August 1994 that we saw the minimum wage in Western Australia start to reverse in terms of its position. And we had the increase last week of $16 per week placed on that, which is double what the Accord will deliver next March, some five months before that particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on the public record the situation which exists in the metal trades industry. An amount of $238.10 per week is the Labor Party's benchmark award in terms of minimum standards. Senator Murphy knows that very well. I have already discovered in Western Australia 16 other minimum rates between $238.10 and $280 operating under federal awards. The article of 17 October says that the ALP is to support honest political advertising laws. It mentions ALP national secretary Gary Gray. He says that the ALP could also outlaw controversial campaign tactics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen perpetrated following the blockade in WA is this action on advertising. We had industrial civil war declared on Western Australia by the trade union movement. I believe that it was supported by this Labor government. When you start examining the facts, you find that the Labor Party's performance in terms of minimum standards has been very poor when it is compared with what exists in Western Australia. Compare it with the present state government or the government prior to Richard Court getting into power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's federal performance is also very poor. Even the state Labor government in Western Australia did better than this federal Labor government has in terms of that situation. Mr Gary Gray is trying to mislead the Australian public with regard to truth in advertising. I find absolutely disgraceful and unacceptable what they are doing now. Firstly, you have been exposed for what you are. Secondly, if you are going to uphold this principle, those ads in Western Australia should be withdrawn immediately and you should apologise to Western Australians. </PARA>

According to my information, the minimum adult rate of pay under the metal trades industry award is $341.40. Let me explain what that is made up of. It is made up of a base component of $284.80, a supplementary payment of $40.60 and a safety net adjustment of $16. That is a lot more than $317.10. The lowest adult rate of pay is $341.40.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an indication that you may have some safety net. Senator Abetz says that that is wrong. Let me put it to you that, in Victoria, Jeff Kennett made application to the state industrial relations commission for a minimum hourly rate of around $8.23. If you were in power now, those people would lose their supplementary payment of $40.60. That would take them back to less than $300 per week.

I would like to outline a few facts with regard to the social wage. The social wage, as I said before for the information of those opposite, includes expenditure on health, education, housing and child care. Under Mr Howard the social wage went backwards to the tune of nearly 18 per cent. That is what is important to the people in this country today.

You have given only four commitments: a minimum wage, four weeks annual leave and 10 days non-cumulative sick leave&mdash;a very poor position&mdash;and we do not even know whether we will get long service leave under you lot. The workers have a right to know.

<PARA>Senator Crowley made the very point that I made the other day when she said that the number of female doctors is half the number of male doctors who have been relocated by the rural incentive program. What interested me so much was the narrow feminist ideology that came through&mdash;that somehow I was reflecting on women because I made the point that women tended to marry. They marry, Senator Crowley. They stay happily married. They worry about their husbands. It is those points that she picked on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the other things I said which she did not comment on was that there was a loss of tax deductibility of education expenses, there was an absence of locums, retraining was needed, there was a maintenance of skills required, re-accreditation was needed, they were constantly on call and could not get people to take their calls and, in addition to that, they could not take holidays. What does Senator Crowley pick on?&mdash;the narrow feminist ideology that somehow I was casting aspersions on females. With seven daughters, and with one wife who is happily married to me, I would not be game! I have eight women around me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The narrow feminist ideology is the thing that got me&mdash;why you picked on that out of about 10 points I made about the shortage of rural doctors. The other thing, Senator Crowley, that you are not aware of, because you were not able to produce the figures, is that the rural incentive program is replacing one or two GPs a week after three years, when your own department says that there is a shortage of 400 to 500 in rural and remote areas. You are replacing one to two a week, but six a week are leaving. So you tell me how that rural incentive program is working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you do not believe me, I draw your attention to the latest addition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Medicine</EMPHASIS> where it says there is `a country crisis'. There is a crisis, Senator Crowley, in obstetrics and in anaesthesia. As you know from the speech I gave last week, I have just toured western Queensland. Senator Crowley, when did you yourself last drive through those rural areas? When have you done 4,000 kilometres, as I did, through western Queensland?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have the figures in front of me. There is a shortage of between 400 or 500 doctors; there is a country crisis in obstetrics, and there is a growing shortage of rural obstetricians, both specialists and GPs. This week's Wodonga paper says that there is a desperate crisis in western New South Wales. It says, `Medical service a major worry. As it is with many small centres, the lack of adequate medical facilities is a major concern.' You are telling me this rural incentive program is working but, Senator Crowley, it is not working. It has not worked; there need to be a lot more incentives. An article in the Victorian AMA's rural newsletter states that there need to be further incentives in relation to the rural incentive program. You are just not giving enough incentives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another big thing which you are not covering is the blow-out in indemnity insurance. We have been waiting for your report for how long&mdash;six or nine months? The editor of the report has gone off on long service leave or study leave or something. We still have not seen that report on medical indemnity insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You come in here and try to pick on me for giving a truthful answer. Your own figures show that, of those needing to be replaced, there is only half the number going out there. You will come back at me, I suppose, and say, `Well, it is only in recent years that the number of females in medical schools has increased.' But the reality is, if you went around these areas, if you spent more time there, you would be a bit more knowledgeable about it, Senator Crowley. Coming in and picking on that very narrow feminist point I think speaks more of your answer than of anything that I have said. When I gave you another 11 reasons, you picked on that one narrow, feminist point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics announced that Australia's inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index, increased by 1.2 per cent in the three months of the September quarter alone to a level 5.1 per cent above that of a year ago. That is a dangerous increase which will set red lights flashing across all business, consumer and wage earner groups in Australia. It is the sixth consecutive quarter in which our annual inflation rate has risen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inflation in Australia is at a rate that puts us firmly in second place&mdash;second only to Italy&mdash;amongst the high inflation nations of the Western world. In Australia, inflation is measured in more than one way. The consumer price index is the most common, but the government also likes to use what it calls the `underlying inflation rate'. It likes this form of measurement because the figure is generally below the consumer price index figure. It excludes such things as meat, fruit and vegetables, clothing, housing interest rates, petrol, fuel and power, local government charges, tobacco and alcohol, health services, pharmaceuticals, education, child care and several other very important items. In other words, it fiddles the inflation that people actually experience, basically to suit its own political ends, although I do accept that there are valid reasons for some of the exclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even this heavily adjusted fiddled inflation figure shows the same dangerously increasing trend as does the consumer price index. In the September quarter, this so-called underlying rate was 3.1 per cent higher than a year earlier. On the government's own reckoning&mdash;no-one else's&mdash;this is a dangerously high figure, because the Reserve Bank of Australia says that the range of acceptable underlying inflation in Australia is two to three per cent; that is, three per cent is the upper level of acceptability. Anything above that is unacceptable and requires policy action to bring the inflation rate back down to within an acceptable range. That policy action involves a range of things. It certainly involves monetary policy and it involves budgetary policy. Monetary policy, of course, means one thing; that is, higher interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what today's inflation figures mean, if they continue in the months ahead&mdash;and there are no grounds for thinking that they will not&mdash;is that interest rates will be on the rise again before too long. They are already amongst the highest in the Western world. It is a figure that is often glossed over by the government in its attempts to conceal the real level of interest rates in this country, but when you look at the real level of interest rates in Australia, they are at all levels, short-term and long-term, amongst the highest in the world. That, of course, increases the competitive difficulties that we face on an international basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, of course, will be doing everything in its power to keep rates from rising before the forthcoming election. They will cajole Reserve Bank Governor, Bernie Fraser, and his team&mdash;and bear in mind that Mr Fraser has already warned the government about rising wage pressures and higher than acceptable inflation; and the implications for interest rates and other economic policy measures that that brings out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government will do anything to avoid a rate increase before the election. But they cannot deny one inescapable fact; that is, that under this Keating government's policies, rates will soon be on the rise again. That inflation figure that we had today is like a time bomb. It is like the foreign debt time bomb we have: tick, tick, tick; away it goes and sooner or later that bomb will explode and interest rates will go up&mdash;and the government knows that full well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of things that Senator Short said that probably need to be corrected. First of all, he attacked the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I will not go into a great defence because it is not necessary. In the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> there was an article about Australia and France being at war over nuclear testing. The headline in heavy black print stated: `War: Chirac v. Keating'. I think the Australian people will be pleased it is Paul Keating. No-one could imagine Chirac versus Howard as any sort of contest in which Australia would stand up with any dignity in the international fora.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short said that the underlying rate of inflation is a fiddled figure. He also said that it is produced for political ends. Neither of those comments are true. For a long time Treasury has produced a figure showing what the underlying rate of inflation is. The underlying rate removes items which are particularly volatile, seasonal or subject to government charges in the CPI in order to make that rate a truer measure of inflation. To accuse anyone of fiddling the books or to say that this is a politically produced figure is to call into question the authority and impartiality of the Treasury in the political process, something that Senator Short is not game to do to its face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not an attack on the government, it is an attack on the Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia which refers to the underlying rate of inflation when it says that the inflation level in Australia should remain between two and three per cent. It is not an attack on the government, it is an attack on both those institutions. Senator Short knows better and he should withdraw those remarks at a future time. To use them in this debate as a sickening attempt to undermine the government is pathetic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This MPI should not succeed and I do not believe it will. We have in Australia sustainable economic growth. We have high and rising living standards. We have low inflation and we have increasing employment. I will go to the first of the trinity of descriptions of the economy which is that growth at present is at 3.75 per cent. We are on track for the budget figure to be realised. This represents 16 successive quarters of growth&mdash;in other words, four years of successive growth. The December quarter this year will record a further quarter of growth, putting us at 17 successive quarters of growth&mdash;one of the longest periods of sustained economic growth in the economic history of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the economic growth performance of this government versus the opposition when it was in government and when the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, was Treasurer of Australia, we find that the average rate of real economic growth for Australia was 2.6 per cent. Under our period of office it is 3.5 per cent. The record for which party can deliver the best economic growth goes to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic growth is important in this debate because it is directed at families. It is growth in the economy that creates opportunities for families and creates opportunities for employment. We have managed to have a high level of economic growth in this country with quite distinctively and importantly a low level of inflation. That is a vital consideration. To get economic growth is one thing but to get it with low inflation is the most important thing. We have delivered that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country is enjoying high and rising living standards. I will go to household disposable incomes. Real household disposable income in percentage terms has, under our government, grown by 41.8 per cent. Real household disposable income per capita has grown by 20.9 per cent. The approximate increase in real annual household disposable income per capita from June 1983 to June 1995, expressed in June 1995 dollars, was $3,500. That is a real dollar increase in per capita household disposable income. That is a record not matched by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recall the opposition's infamous trinity of double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and negative economic growth when they were cast from office by the Australian electorate. Under us, living standards have risen. They have also risen in terms of company profits and because of retained income in national savings through superannuation. That is an initiative introduced by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to our ascension to office, superannuation was the privilege of the upper executive in corporations or public servants. Blue-collar workers and others in the private sector typically did not have access to superannuation. Now all workers do. The lowest to highest paid have access to superannuation and can look forward to a dignified retirement. We are building a national pool of savings for investment in the Australian economy which will grow the economy and return a retirement wage to ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's debate has been sparked by the September quarter CPI figures released by the Statistician at 11.30 this morning. These figures show that the underlying rate of inflation in Australia for the year is 3.1 per cent. I believe it is important to put those figures in context. That is exactly what the Treasurer (Mr Willis) did today. In a press release he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While today's result indicates that through the year underlying inflation rate has risen above 3 per cent for the first time since December 1991, this outcome is not inconsistent with the commitment of the government and the Reserve Bank of Australia to keep underlying inflation between 2 to 3 per cent on average over the course of the economic cycle.</PARA>
<PARA>To put this figure in context, the Treasurer stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Treasury underlying measure of inflation attempts to measure generalised inflationary pressures by removing items that are particularly volatile, seasonal or subject to government influence, it can still be affected by one-off changes. For example, the September quarter increase in the underlying rate has been influenced by the increase in third party insurance premiums and by the changes to the wholesale sales tax rate (WST).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-New motor vehicle prices, reflecting increases in WST, and motor vehicle insurance contributed 0.36 percentage points to the quarterly increase in the underlying rate. In the absence of these increases the underlying rate would have risen by around 0.8 per cent in the quarter, and 2.7 per cent through the year.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why we are working within the parameters. That is why the scaremongering motion ought not be entertained for one minute. It is fair to say that we are operating within the parameters set out by the budget. The economy is not in panic mode as the opposition would like it to be. The economy has a strong level of growth which is underpinned by some inflationary pressures which are in a manageable area and within the scope of what we believe is manageable. They are within the budget settings, as I have said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significant thing about inflation, and one cannot leave a debate on the subject of inflation without making this point, is that we have an accord with the union movement of Australia. One of the areas through which inflation can be pushed quickest is excessive wage settlements. Under that accord, we have entered into an agreement which ensures that wage settlements will not push the underlying rate of inflation beyond the two per cent to three per cent area. That is what the Reserve Bank of Australia says is the manageable area. That is what the accord says. We do expect that that will be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has an industrial relations track record which makes it impossible to have any agreement with the trade union movement of Australia. We are able to reach a situation by having an agreement with them in which there is wage moderation for tax trade-offs and improvements in the social wage so the living standards rise&mdash;that is, all those things affected by the level of income in wages, the level of tax paid out of those wages and the social wage delivered by the government to the individual household. We have a situation where we can trade that off because of a cooperative relationship with the union movement in order to ensure living standards rise, profits remain high and investment can occur in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anyone can leave this debate without referring to taxation. We had a little encounter, one might say, during question time on the subject of taxation. I think this motion, which gets it lamentably wrong but politically wrong on purpose in order to make a case that does not exist, a fictional case against the government, was moved by the opposition in order to hide the fact that the opposition has not declared to the Australian people its own economic policies. It is criticised in the media by economic commentators for not doing so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that to have the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) come into this chamber on this debate and accuse the coalition of not having its economic policies in front of the Australian people is an act of gross hypocrisy, absolute gross hypocrisy. This is the who has been described in the paper as not being able to get his innovation statement before the Australian people because people like Wayne Swan and Stephen Smith, the member for Lilley and the member for Perth respectively, have described it as a bronze medal strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>

We in the Senate and the Australian people know the fact is that Minister Cook, the bronze medal man, will not be capable of writing this policy or getting any visionary policy up so Don Russell has been called back from Washington to write it. I would not be surprised if the poor old scungy, mangy draft of this policy that must be gathering dust by this stage, the paper must be turning brown, has indeed been faxed to Washington so Mr Russell can work on it when he sits on his 747 on his way home next week. </PARA>

You get up in this chamber day by day and say&mdash;and you have said it again today&mdash;how wonderful things are in this economy, how the Australian people are doing so well under you. I get angry when I hear you say that. You are in politics.

Those very people read it and they probably say to themselves, `Hang on. This government is reducing taxes, but I went to the supermarket last week and all my groceries that have got a sales tax on them have gone up: detergent, soft drinks, biscuits, toothpaste, toothbrushes, all of those items.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You just admitted in your speech that inflation has gone up because sales taxes have gone up&mdash;as if some fairy godmother had introduced all these new tax taxes. Are you blaming the tax department, are you blaming Mr Carmody for inflation now? It was your government that promised the people that we would not have any increases in taxes. You made it quite clear to the Australian people that the reason not to vote for Dr Hewson last time was that he was going to put up the price of your groceries. What did you do? Within months of coming to power, you put them up. I think it was Access Economics which reported only recently that the taxes on the necessities of life have actually gone up more under your government than they would have if there had been a GST. So you are blaming Mr Carmody for putting inflation up. </PARA>

But I tell you what: there would be nothing surer than that you tax building items.

When we come to the election next year the Australian people will only have to look at the record of the Kennett government and the Court government on a range of policies because we are not going to hear very much from Mr Howard. All we can do is look at the record in Victoria and Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell mentioned industrial relations policy. Industrial relations is a major issue. It is a very important issue for all Australians. Look at the models that we have in Victoria and Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to return to Senator Short because he referred particularly to living standards. He claims that living standards under the federal government are not what they should be. Let us look at what they are under a Liberal state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to analyse what has happened in industrial relations, Premier Kennett's new employee relations commission has changed the set of powers and that means that equal pay is no longer protected. Equal pay is something that women in Australia still do not receive. Premier Kennett is prepared to undermine the equal pay that is available to many women. For example, women are disadvantaged under enforced individual contracts. That matter was debated very vociferously in Western Australia last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Premier Kennett has weakened the Equal Opportunity Commission. He has cut back on material health care with no follow up support for new mothers. We are all aware of the risk of child abuse. Parents are not supported in the early months. Women are being released too early from hospital. We have seen cut backs in kindergarten services. We now have a new $100 tax on all property owners.

We had the very uneventful launch of the blue book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shaping the Nation</EMPHASIS>. I notice that speakers on the other side of the chamber have not brought that book into the chamber. That publication was meant to document line by line the performance of this government over the past 13 years. Within a week of the government trumpeting its performances in government we find that it is now in tatters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, we had the failure of the Working Nation statement last week with the publication of the unemployment figures. The figures are trending up. We have had a desperate attempt to rework Working Nation. We have also had the collapse of the superannuation policy. We are told that it is in the revamp state, too. In the publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shaping the Nation</EMPHASIS> the government lauded its low inflation policy around which the whole budget strategy is centred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we had the announcement of Australia's annual headline inflation rate and we find that it has climbed to 5.1 per cent. That absolutely snuffs out any chance of a fall in interest rates, other than those that are politically motivated. The fear is that interest rates will now rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last month we had the announcement that Australia's foreign debt is at a record level. One would have to say that the government's whole economic strategy is on the verge of collapse. We must remember that in July this year the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, when referring to inflation, said this at an ALP dinner:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we look at what economic significance will give us a guide to our economic performance as a country over the next three or four years, the key piece of economic news is the two to three per cent inflation target in the wages Accord.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreeing on a wages system which endorses the government's and the Reserve Bank's two to three per cent inflation target is an event of seminal economic significance: significance to competitiveness, significance to investments and savings; and to a lower CAD.</PARA>
<PARA>The inflation rate that the Prime Minister was talking about was the headline rate. That rate is five per cent, not two to three. Today's inflation announcement does more to undermine the credibility of the government than any other single economic statistic or trend that we have had of late. That is why the government has placed great store in holding down the inflation rate. It has underpinned the government's whole fragile and shonky economic strategy. The government has tried every deceptive policy available to show that it has broken the inflation stick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had false budget surpluses, artificially high interest rates, superficial wages Accords and even slick salesmanship from the Prime Minister in an attempt to convince the marketplace of the government's anti-inflation policies. Today we have arrived at a point where the bond yields are on the rise again, as they were in 1994, in expectation of entrenched inflation in the future. As this effect cascades through the economy and high inflation takes hold and interest rates remain high, the losers will be the people battling to pay off their mortgage home loans with no expected relief; the people battling to stay afloat in small business with no expected relief; and the worst affected will be the unemployed. The cost to business to further employ has gone up. We have the threat and fear of a wages spiral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even worse news today was the increase in the underlying rate of inflation. This was a figure that was trumped up by the government and the Reserve Bank as being something that was far more important than the headline inflation rate. It is supposed to be the rate at which the Reserve Bank and the government will set policy. The Australian public would rather look at a rise in the cost of living. The Reserve Bank's annual report defined the underlying rate as the consumer price index less fruit and vegetables, fuel, mortgage interest charges, consumer credit charges, public dwelling rent, local government rates and charges, household fuel and light, postal and telephone services, motoring charges, health services, pharmaceuticals, education, child care et cetera et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all those exclusions you would have to ask yourself: what exactly is it measuring? This measure is absolutely no comfort to the real people who are feeling these inflationary effects on their real standards of living and their real incomes. As they see it, the real inflation rate is the headline rate. That is what affects them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also the headline rate that underpins the wages accord with the government&mdash;not the underlying rate. It is true to say that the previous ACTU President, Martin Ferguson, and the present ACTU President, Jennie George, have made it quite clear that it is the headline rate of inflation which affects their members. Today's inflation rate announcement has all the hallmarks of yet another government policy starting to fray at the edges with a real fear of a return to the wage-price spiral of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time I have left, I have to say that today's inflation rate really does send shudders and fear throughout the economy for the average Australian and for the battlers, for now they face a spiralling inflation rate and further danger to their standard of living. </PARA>

Sure, you would get more for your house, but your house would likely be a tiny box in the middle of a vast, dirty, noisy city. You would get more wages on an international basis, but milk is several dollars a litre, there is no space, there is no beach to head down to and islands are built out of the garbage people dispose of. This is economic wealth, but natural living becomes inaccessible. Are living standards higher?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen these MPIs pour from the opposition benches lately. Somewhere you will need to sit down and work out some of the contradictions in them&mdash;not just the coalition, since the government makes the same demands that reality adjust itself to policy. You want people to have higher living standards but not higher wages, because increased wages will increase inflation. You want labour market reform because this will decrease labour costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be fewer workers, or they will be paid less, and they will work harder for the same money. This will give us higher living standards. We are told that the profits companies make will be reinvested to create more jobs. If these jobs continue to be low paid, how will people be better off and have higher standards of living? You want higher house prices because this increases the value of the family investment, but you want prices, interest rates and wages to stay down. Every time that house prices go up, not only do those who sell houses make money but those who buy will need to borrow more money. If that is the case, either they will be worse off or they will be pushing for higher wages so that they can afford a house. The more people borrow to spend on a house, the fewer savings there are, the less money is available for productive investment and the more pressure there is to raise interest rates. Do not you see some contradictions here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth is good mentality does not work. Growth does not solve our problems. Growth in resource demand increases marginal costs, and technological input is needed as resources decline in quantity and quality. Economic growth is based on increased activity and increased profits, which are based on decreased costs of input, including labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of motions relating to the growing gap between the rich and the poor. This growing gap is a feature of growth everywhere in the developed world. It is a direct outcome of growth. The Greens would like to see stable prices and low stable interest rates. This includes stable house prices. We would like to see a stable population and a stable, steady state economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From there, we would like to see society address the real barriers to higher living standards. These include the pointless waste of resources in our current modes of consumption. They include the lack of distribution of employment. If we established a more equitable sharing of jobs, we would get effective full employment. We should also address the central issue of the maldistribution of profits, which reinforces the maldistribution of wealth and power. We might then start seeing something worthy of the term `rising standards of living'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a number of occasions in this place in recent times we have mentioned the fact that, in the end, if we want to see distributive equity in Australia and small business able to survive, we have to start thinking radically. We have to start thinking about regional and local based economies. We have to start thinking about the amazingly radical concept of paying people more per hour to work less, and distributing the work available. It might seem, in the short term, that you are increasing your costs. But, in reality, if you are only using labour as a cost of production, you are missing the point in terms of standards of living and the ability of our economy to survive. Basically, the standard of living depends on people's ability to enjoy their life, leisure and families and to be able to participate&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an interesting document because it touches on part of the services in the building that are used by all senators, which is the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Research Service. Some of us use the Library to lesser or greater degrees. I am currently reading a book which the Library was kind enough to borrow on my behalf from the National Library of Australia. It is a great privilege that we have, and we should always be grateful for it. At other times, I use, as honourable senators would, the Parliamentary Research Service and the Parliamentary Library Information Service. They are also very important. So we have to pay attention to what happens in the Library and how the resources are used to maximise its efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always said that the Library is probably more important for the opposition than it is for the government. I will explain why. In government, one has all the resources of a department to provide information to ministers. Whichever group of parties is in government has easier access to material from those departments. That is not a complaint; it is just a fact of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To balance it up and for the benefit of a good democratic system, there has to be a mechanism by which those who are in opposition, or those who are in the minor parties&mdash;heaven knows, sometimes I think some of the minor parties need all the help they can get&mdash;can get access to information. That, of course, for us often means the Parliamentary Library and the research service there, in particular, in producing research and discussion papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is interesting to note some of the statistics that were pulled out by the Parliamentary Library Research Service on requests for information. Ten per cent of senators and members, which on my reckoning is about 25 people, made 30.6 per cent of the requests; and a quarter of senators and members made 52.6 per cent of requests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is page 18. A quarter of all requests were made by just 16 senators and members. I might be wrong but it sounds very much like most of the requests came from the shadow ministry or the shadow cabinet, and that is not a bad thing. I know that when Senator Walsh was in the place, he made enormous use of the library, as well as other resources, when he was no longer in the ministry. He was stunningly effective in what he did as a result of the flow of information. But it stresses the importance of the library to those of us who are in opposition at the moment and it stresses the importance of the library to those who may be in opposition after the next election. I think everybody has a vested interest in making sure that the system works well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that a couple of years ago when the Parliamentary Library came within the purview of Estimates Committee A&mdash;and you will remember it, Madam Acting Deputy President&mdash;there was enormous consternation over the mismanagement of the library. The matters no longer come before an estimates committee on which I take an active interest; but it was decided at that point in time that some temporary measures be taken to rectify the parlous situation into which the library had fallen. As a consequence of that, you will well recall, Madam Acting Deputy President, that it was decided that Mr John Templeton should take over as acting librarian, although he was not a librarian himself. That was done for administrative reasons to try to rectify some of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is several years ago and Mr Templeton seems to have done a fairly reasonable job. But it is interesting to note that nowhere in the document is there mention of the future of the library under a librarian. Mr Templeton signs the report as `Acting Parliamentary Librarian'. If matters that caused the concern in the first place have been resolved, then maybe it is time that we have a parliamentary librarian, a person who is skilled in librarianship, to deal with the library and also the flow of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, it is a difficult matter because the Parliamentary Library is not like any other library in this country. It is as much a research service as a library. But, certainly, there are issues there that have to be dealt with and, certainly, we are talking about multimedia and so on. The principles of good librarianship are as applicable to CD-ROMs as they are applicable to books. So there is no reason why it should not happen now if the problems have been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see on page 17 the table of requests completed and the time taken to complete those requests. There is quite a degree of variation which is attributable in part to the sitting periods. It seems like there are more requests for information when parliament sits than when parliament is not sitting. In the accounts at the end of the report, it is made very clear that it is very difficult to predict the flow of work, the amount of time required and the resources needed because it varies according to external factors over which the library has no control. But I think Senator Kemp would agree it is a good thing that nobody can ration our access to the library. That would be an horrendous situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that the library has done such a good job. I wish we could have had more opportunity to scrutinise this in further detail. I note that Senator Kemp is keen to make a contribution to the debate on the report. I only hope that, if there are no honourable senators who wish to follow Senator Kemp in his comments, he will seek leave to continue his remarks so that we can keep the debate open. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRIMARY INDUSTRIES CHARGES BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRIMARY INDUSTRIES LEVIES AND CHARGES (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this package of bills is to rationalise into a single framework the 59 separate levies and charges acts currently imposing levies on primary industry products. It complements the significant rationalisation of the levies and charges collection legislation that took place in 1991 and is consistent with Blewett report that sought to reduce the parliamentary legislative program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is designed to overcome past problems caused by the volume of Primary Industries and Energy portfolio legislation and the logjam the levies and charges legislation created by requiring constant amendment in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have analysed the problem, consulted extensively with industry and concluded that amalgamating all the levies and charges into two framework acts will make more effective use of parliamentary time dealing with levy legislation. It will also assist industry to have changes to levies put in place more rapidly than on some occasions in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levies and charges in question are not unilaterally imposed by the government, but rather are sought by representative industry bodies, on behalf of the industry. Their purpose is to fund activities such as marketing and research and development that would be beyond the scope of individual farmers on their own. I would expect that more levies will be requested by industry in the future, particularly in new and emerging industries and most probably for R&amp;D.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levies bill and the charges bill set up a framework for imposing levies on primary industry products by regulation. They will allow new industries or new products to be included quickly on the request of the industry concerned, while, at the same time, protecting parliament's powers to decide on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to recognise that this streamlining process will not change the practical impact of the current legislation but only the way levies are established or amended. There will be no discernible difference from the industry point of view in the way that the levies and charges processes operate other than that any changes they wish to make to maximum levy or charge rates will be able to be completed in a much shorter time frame.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Previously maximum rates for levies and charges were included in each individual levy or charge act to give parliament control over any arbitrary imposition of taxation. Because of the wide variety of bases for the calculation of the levy and charge rates it was not possible to find a suitable formula covering all industries to include in the framework legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bills therefore require the maximum rates of each levy or charge to be set out in special regulations. Normal regulations come into effect on gazettal before they are tabled in parliament. These special regulations will not come into effect until after the parliamentary disallowance period is completed. This still gives the parliament the ultimate role in determining maximum rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Impositions of levy or changes to levy matters such as maximum and operative rates can only be made on the recommendation of the designated body and after the required consultation with the relevant industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bills also require any increases in maximum rates to be published in a daily newspaper in the states and territories to ensure that individuals in an industry are aware of them. Initially, the maximum rates to be included in the special regulations are likely to be the same as those currently applying in each industry, unless the industry has specifically sought a different rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bills allow the minister to declare a designated body or bodies for each industry to make recommendations regarding the setting of levy or charge rates. Where there is more than one designated body for a particular industry these bodies will be required to agree on any recommendations they make to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Designated bodies are also required to consult with other representative bodies. For example, if the designated body for a particular industry is a peak grower body, it is required by reference to section 22 of the Primary Industries Levies Bill 1995 to consult with any other eligible industry bodies set out in the relevant statutory marketing authority act before making recommendations to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relevant industry or product regulations will contain</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the detail of the particular levies or charges,</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">what they will be used for.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulations for each industry will be very similar to the regulations currently in force, but will include some provisions from the old levy or charge acts that do not appear in the new bills because they were too specific for the framework nature of the new bills. We will be circulating draft copies of the regulations to industry organisations for comment when they are drafted. This continues the consultative approach we have adopted with industry through the development of this streamlined levy package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A third bill is included in this package&mdash;the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995. This bill includes the repeal of the old levies and charges acts and a number of amendments to other acts that make reference to the old levy and charges acts. These amendments are necessary to ensure that levies and charges can still be collected and the correct amounts can be paid to the correct organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commencement date for this legislative package is 1 July 1996 to allow time for the regulations for all the relevant industries to be made and tabled in the parliament. However, certain sections of the legislation will commence on royal assent to allow designated bodies to be declared and maximum rates, to be set in time for the commencement of operation of the levies and charges acts. Regulations relating to operative rates of levies and charges will also be able to be made and tabled for disallowance following royal assent but these regulations will not come into force until the remainder of the act commences on 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A wide range of representative bodies in all the primary industries covered by the current levy and charge arrangements have given broad support to the approach being taken. Draft copies of these bills have been made available for comment to these bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me remind honourable senators that this legislation was inspired by two things</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">industry's need for a streamlined and more responsive process; and</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1995 will provide legislative authority for measures that will assist in giving effect to the Government's decision to restructure the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will also provide for the abolition of related legislation, namely the Housing Loans Insurance Act 1965 and the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Act 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The restructuring, or corporatisation, of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was announced in the 1995-96 Budget. It is designed to provide the Corporation with greater freedom to operate on a strict commercial basis and, as such, to put it on a more comparable footing vis-a-vis its competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to follow this approach reflects the same considerations that had earlier influenced the Government to attempt to sell the Corporation, namely that the prevailing conditions in the mortgage insurance and finance industries now differ considerably compared with when the Corporation was set up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was established as a statutory authority thirty years ago to meet a structural deficiency in the highly-regulated financial environment which existed at that time. Its primary charter was to help low income earners with small deposits to obtain housing finance; financial institutions tended to allocate their then scarce housing funds on a least-risk basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since those days, a competitive private sector mortgage insurance industry has emerged in Australia. Together with the finance industry reforms introduced by this Government, this has removed the old structural deficiency in the housing finance market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With these improvements in access to housing finance, the objective of the Government has been to maintain and enhance these achievements by ensuring that there is an efficient, diverse and competitive mortgage insurance market. The decision a number of years ago to attempt to sell the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation reflected the view that the continued involvement of a statutory authority in the industry was not consistent with this objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, efforts to sell the Corporation have not proceeded since it has become clear that the sale was not going to produce a satisfactory result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence, the Government has considered alternative approaches. It commissioned the Task Force on Asset Sales' financial advisers, Baring Bros Burrows and Co Limited, to undertake a complete review of the sale process and the Corporation's position in the market. They concluded, among other things, that the Corporation enjoyed a number of advantages over its private sector competitors arising from its statutory authority status, including the guarantee of its liabilities, and from the fact that it is not subject to the supervision of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As these benefits, which put the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation on a different basis to its competitors, would not be available to any potential purchasers, it was difficult for them to establish the nature and size of the business that would exist post-sale and, so, to put a value on the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The corporatisation arrangements that the Government now proposes represent a significant move in addressing these concerns. A new company will be established under the Corporations Law which will be subject to the regulatory requirements of ISC, as well as those of the States and Territories. The new company will be fully capitalised in line with the requirements of the ISC, drawing on part of the present capital and reserves of the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing Commonwealth guarantee will be removed as far as borrowings by the Corporation is concerned. However, the Commonwealth guarantee for non-borrowing liabilities has been retained, at least for the moment, to minimise any uncertainty in the mortgage insurance industry that might arise as a consequence of the restructuring of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, given its prominent position in the market. Furthermore, to enable the company to attain the minimum credit rating required for mortgage insurers by state legislation without retaining that guarantee, it would be necessary for the Commonwealth to commit significant additional capital resources to the Corporation, over and above what is already proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in setting a target rate of return for the company, account will be taken of any advantage the retention of the guarantee may accord it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the removal of the guarantee on borrowing, there is no longer a need for a specific legislative provision as the Treasurer has the powers under the Constitution to guarantee liabilities of a non-borrowing nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation will cease writing business on the day before the new company comes into operation. The insurance policies of the Corporation entered into prior to and including that date, which we might refer to as the `old book', will become the direct responsibility of the Commonwealth. In exchange for accepting these liabilities, the Commonwealth will receive the balance of the Corporation's capital and reserves. On the Budget estimates, the level of funds likely to be transferred to consolidated revenue is expected to be in excess of $100 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Housing Loans Insurance Corporation will be contracted by the Commonwealth to administer the unexpired portion of all insurance obligations contained in the `old book'. Funds will be set aside by the Commonwealth in a special account to be established by this new company and will be replenished as and when necessary to meet claims against these insurance contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transfer of the `old book' to the Commonwealth along these lines is consistent with the arrangements that would have been put in place had the sale of the Corporation proceeded in 1991. Separation of the `old book' will, in particular, enable the new company's performance to be judged independently of the Corporation's previous operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill currently before the Senate is designed to assist in giving effect to the arrangements that I have just outlined. It includes the following:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provision to the Treasurer of the necessary powers to direct the transfer of assets and liabilities in whatever way is considered appropriate to give effect to the abovementioned objectives;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">authority for the Treasurer to enter into an agreement with the new Company which would cover the terms under which existing insurance contracts would be managed, as well as the means by which payments for claims arising from these contracts could be made. The latter includes a standing appropriation for the required funding; </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the transfer of staff of the Corporation to the new company, as well as the transfer of all current rights enjoyed by those staff with respect to such matters as long service leave, superannuation, maternity leave and Comcare. It is not intended that the interests of the staff should in any way be adversely affected by this corporatisation exercise;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provision to exempt from taxation transactions involving such matters as the transfer of assets that would not have arisen apart from the corporatisation exercise; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">finally, the winding up of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation and the repeal of all relevant legislation relating to the Corporation. As part of the winding up exercise, a final report and detailed financial statements as at the date of cessation of the Corporation's activities will be prepared by the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. After being audited by the Audit office, they will be tabled in the Parliament in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I conclude by pointing out to the Senate that the restructuring of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation that is proposed is seen by the Government as an important step in its efforts to maintain an efficient and competitive mortgage insurance market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Employment Services Act 1994 established the case management system and established the Employment Services Regulatory Authority (ESRA) as an independent statutory authority responsible for regulating the case management system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill would make machinery changes consequential to the implementation of changed case management arrangements for certain part-time and seasonal workers. It would also streamline certain administrative procedures relating to CES notification requirements and allow the Employment Services Regulatory Authority (ESRA) to obtain goods and services by using a credit card.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill would provide for consequential amendments arising from proposed changes to the Social Security Act 1991 that would amalgamate job search allowance and newstart allowance. It would also amend the Social Security Act to provide for the National Convenor of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to delegate his or her powers under the Employment Services Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the bill would allow for inclusion in determinations made under the act provisions relating to resetting unemployment registration to zero of particular clients who decline to continue to participate in the case management system. This is in line with announcements made in the 1995-96 Budget and already implemented. The new arrangements were introduced for part-time and seasonal workers because they have substantial and recent workforce experience and may not require, or in some instances want, the level of assistance provided under case management. The bill would seek to make consequential amendments to that part of the act that defines Job Compact eligibility for the purposes of a Case Management Activity Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill would streamline requirements on the CES to notify and interview a person after they become a participant in the case management system. The existing provisions of the  Employment Services Act 1994 require two separate contacts to be made; the first being when a person becomes a participant in the case management system and the second when the person is to be referred to a case manager. The bill would require the CES to make a single contact with the jobseeker for the purpose of notifying participant status and for requesting the jobseeker to attend or take part in an interview. Under the bill notification that a person is a participant in the case management system will be made when the CES calls the jobseeker in for an interview and considers that a referral can be made to a case manager within 24 days of a referral interview taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, ESRA is unable to use Government credit card facilities because the act does not provide for it to borrow money. To overcome the administrative inconvenience this causes, the bill would provide for ESRA to obtain goods and services on credit by the use of a credit card.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequential amendments are also required to the act following changes to the Social Security Act 1991 to allow for the amalgamation of Jobsearch and Newstart Allowance with effect from 20 September 1996. The bill would provide for these consequential amendments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to this amendment, I think it is worth while to refer back to the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee dated March 1995. Recommendation 3 of that report stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Family Court of Australia monitor parenting plans when filed in the Registry. The Court should make rules specifying the information required in the plan.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what this amendment seeks to do. As I recall it, in the course of the hearings in relation to this bill, the Law Council of Australia put to the committee the assertion that in property matters the court inquires into deeds of agreement reached between the parties to see that they are just and equitable. When you come to children, I think it was Senator Spindler who said that they should not be treated just like chattels. When you look at the requirements made of the Family Court in relation to real property and personal property, I would say that the requirements should be more onerous when looking at the welfare of children. Mr Watt, who is Deputy Chairman of the family law section of the Law Council of Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are talking about people being able to enter into parenting plans or obtain consent orders simply by filing with the courts an agreement that has been signed around the kitchen table . . . That is exactly what is happening under this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . When parties separate, or even just upon disagreement arising within the marriage before they separate, they can say this is what is going to happen to the children and, under the bill as it presently stands, they can write it down on a piece of paper and, provided they sign it, one of the parties can then take that off to the court and register it as a parenting plan.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Watt went on to say, and this was echoed by Senator Vanstone earlier, that this then has effect as if it were an order of the court. Of course, other consequential matters flow from that. The scrap of paper is no longer a scrap of paper. It has the full effect and force of a Family Court order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would submit to the Senate that what we have is a situation where, if the plan is to have that effect, then the court should have the ability to inquire into the best interests of the children. When one looks at the amendment moved by Senator Vanstone, proposed section 63D firstly provides for independent legal advice, which I think is a very good idea. Senator Vanstone has more than adequately set out as to how one party may be in a more subordinate role to the other and therefore in need of separate advice, particularly in a relationship where one party exercises some degree of emotional control over the other. That is important to start with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the court has to be satisfied that the arrangements set out in the plan are likely to promote the best interests of the child. That is imperative. Subsection (2) goes on to say that, in looking at what is likely to promote the best interests of the child, the court may have regard to the matters set out in subsection 68F(2). It sets out a whole raft of criteria that deal with what the court might hold to be in the best interests of the child. The age of the child, the health of the child and other aspects are dealt with there. If needs be, the court can inquire into the plan that has been put before it and, in doing so, can have regard to this whole range of criteria set out in 68F(2). That gives the court some important flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that every parenting plan that is presented to the court will require this. It won't. It may be that in 10 per cent or even in five per cent of cases the court will have to inquire further and address these issues. Even if it is in a minority of cases of the order I mentioned&mdash;such low percentages as five or 10&mdash;it is still important that the court have that ability to inquire further. That is absolutely essential when one looks at this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have that requirement for property. The court has to make sure that any deed of agreement in relation to property is fair and equitable. Since the inception of the Family Law Act the court is placed in a position where it inquires behind the agreement that is placed before it. In a situation dealing with children, the matter becomes even more important. The best interests of the children must be taken into consideration and the court, in some cases, has to undertake an affirmative role in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (3) of the amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Rules of Court may deal with how the plan may be registered in a court.</PARA>
<PARA>That is self-evident. Therefore, I submit that this amendment moved by Senator Vanstone incorporates the concerns mentioned by Senator Spindler on behalf of the Democrats in relation to the best interests of the children. It is an important aspect. That concern was raised before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee and is one which certainly had the strong support of the family law section of the Australian Law Council. For the variety of grounds I have put to the chamber, I commend this amendment and implore the government to once again assess its position in relation to this matter. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are talking about children it is a little different to when we are talking about property. Property is disposed of once and for all. You say, `You have the house, you have the car, you have the farm,' and so on. The property is distributed among the two parties, and that is the end of it. To compare children to property is the wrong concept. To say we have to deal with the property in the correct way and, therefore, we have to deal with the children in an even more correct way misses the point, because children are not property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this new legislation, children will be subject to both parents while their parents live. You have to try to work out a scheme that can accommodate both parents and the children. The children are, as they ought to be, the main matter of concern for any legislature. If the parents work out a plan which both feel happy with for the children's sake and for their own sakes and if the plan they have worked out is correct and the children will be looked after properly, why should not that position remain until some problem arises?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem I have with the amendment moved by Senator Vanstone is that it is very much the same as the amendment moved by Senator Spindler. It is introducing the court at the wrong point in time. The court ought to be introduced when the problem arises. With property, the problem arises when it is to be distributed. Once it is distributed, that is it. With children, the problem arises when something goes wrong with the arrangements that the parents have made. It is at that point in time that the court ought to look at what is happening. That is the point I want to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would be in the interests of the court. If you are going to have this situation, there will be a need for a lot more judges than you presently have and for a lot more court space. Senator Vanstone's amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A parenting plan may be registered in a court having jurisdiction under this Part if:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) it is signed by the parties . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is fair enough; and if the parties have been provided with independent legal advice. That situation could lead to a lot of clumsiness as to how an agreement can be brought into operation. Each party has to get together the funds to see separate lawyers to get a considerable amount of advice. If the lawyer charges a moderate fee, it is going to be an expensive exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be a demand for more legal aid, which is proper. There is such a demand for legal aid now that to introduce a demand where I say there is no need for it could be a little unwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more importantly, it introduces into an agreement that the parties might want to reach the need for legal advice, which is not always likely to be a good thing. The amendment refers to the court having to be satisfied that the arrangements set out in the plan are likely to promote the best interests of the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I say to Senator Vanstone: that would seem to require the court going through a full-scale hearing. If the court has to satisfy itself that the plans are likely to promote the best interests of the child, I would have thought that required a fairly long and extensive investigation by the court. You would have a hearing. The very need for a plan would hardly continue to exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People might come to a parenting plan and not register it. Wouldn't that be sensible? If you are going to set out a regime which makes things quite difficult, why would you register it? Why wouldn't you come to a parenting plan and go ahead on that basis? If you go ahead on that basis, why penalise the parents, who might want to register a plan, by making things much more difficult than would be the case if they did not register it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there should be a monitoring process&mdash;say the registrar monitors it or somebody goes through the plan and looks at it and says, `This seems to be reasonable,' and that is it. To require the court to satisfy itself seems to be a terribly involved process. Why don't we just monitor the plans? The registrar or a judge could read through the plan and see whether it is right on the face of it and lets it go. To require this process to be gone through seems to be pretty  complicated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to contribute again to the debate on this amendment I moved. I would like to add to something that Senator Spindler raised earlier when we were debating this matter prior the matters of public interest discussion. The point he raised was that the government might be happy with this arrangement for parenting plans and to have no scrutiny at all, not even the monitoring at a very low level that I think Senator Cooney is suggesting&mdash;and I will come to whether I agree with that or not. But the government would say, `Well, when one party fails to stick to the agreement, that is when the problem arises and that is when the court needs to come in.' Senator Cooney you were, in fact, emphasising that point yourself. You did not respond to a number of matters that were raised earlier in the debate&mdash;and I do not think you were here at that point, Senator Cooney; you were probably in your room listening&mdash;namely, if you have two parties of unequal strength and there are any consequences at all that hang on the agreement, then surely you want to ensure that the weaker party has some advice before entering into that agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nobody who is of the view that parties are always equal in matrimonial proceedings. It is pretty well a 100 per cent view that one party is weaker than the other; and if there are consequences that hang on the agreement being registered, then those parties should be independently advised. I do not assume that you would, generally speaking, disagree with that. If parties are going to register something in a court and consequences flow from it, they should have advice prior to doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney says, as I say, that when the problem arises the court will concern itself with what is in the best interests of the child. There are two points to make. Firstly, it is not only the interests of the child that are being looked at here. While they are paramount, it is the interests of the weaker party as well. We need to ensure that they are protected in terms of their access to the child. There are a whole range of things they might want some advice on. It is better to do that than have them realise, having signed an agreement, that they would have been better to have the advice on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, let us not just focus on whether, if one party breaks the agreement, you are then going to the court to try to get enforcement proceedings&mdash;and we are satisfying ourselves that at least the court will then look at what is in the best interests of the child. Let us look at where the parties decide they want to easily change the agreement and they do not agree as to how it ought to be changed. That is the only time at which you say the court can come into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us say that it is the weaker party who has made the agreement and wants to change it. I am talking about a couple here who, we will assume for the purposes of this debate, have the best interests of their child or children at heart and there has been some change in circumstances. She might have got a job full time as opposed to part time; his income might have changed; he might want to move interstate&mdash;or whatever. A whole range of matters&mdash;I am sure you can list hundreds of them, Senator Cooney&mdash;can happen that mean the parties want to change the agreement, and one party may want to change it in a different way from that in which the other party wants to change it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney, I would be interested in hearing how easily you think that is done once this is registered as an order of the court. Let us assume for the sake of the argument that it is the weaker party&mdash;because that is always the one the law would be looking to protect&mdash;who wants to change the agreement because of changed circumstances and the stronger party does not. It may well be that that is at much more expense to the weaker party&mdash;and I understand the point you made about the expense of getting legal advice. And, if I say so myself, Senator Cooney, I thought you came very close to making some slightly disparaging remarks about the legal profession. I certainly hope I did not hear a glimmer of insult towards the profession in your remarks. You were certainly very limited in your praise as to what benefit might be available to parties if they did seek legal advice at an earlier stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the situation that I am raising, some circumstances have changed, the weaker party may want to change the agreement and the stronger party does not agree. I do not think you can assure us, Senator Cooney, that the weaker party would not in those circumstances have benefited from legal advice in the first place. The weaker party will be up for much greater costs than the initial advice in getting the agreement changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it is similar to why I would advise someone to get legal advice before they make a will, instead of trotting down to their local stationery shop and filling in predetermined paragraph headings. The reason would be that it is only with some skill in a particular area that you can look to the future. Plenty of people make the mistake of making a will and listing such assets that they have now and not putting appropriate remarks in to cover other assets that they acquire and what will happen with the rest of them. They do not adequately cater for what will happen if one of the parties to whom they were leaving something dies before they do. I am sure you understand what I am saying, Senator Cooney. Someone trained in an area understands how circumstances might change. They have seen it day after day, with client after client. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I would say that they are in a far better position to advise someone at the commencement of making an agreement: `what are you going to do if you want the kids to change school or he wants to move interstate?' They need to try to sort some of these things out at the beginning. The consequences of not doing that are that, when you want to change the agreement, the stronger party is going to use all the force that he or she can, and the weaker party is going to have much greater expense in trying to get that agreement changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I just put it to you that the only reason for wanting advice is not the paramount interests of the child. They are paramount, but it is also the interests of the weaker party, because there are consequences for both parties of registering. If you say, Senator Cooney, `Well, no, there is not. There is really nothing to it; it is just a pretty stamp that is put on it by the court,' then why are we bothering to make the change? I do not think you were suggesting that it is nothing more than a stamp. It has the imprimatur of a federal court on the agreement. It becomes a court order. Rights and duties and obligations are affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought, Senator Cooney, that in all those circumstances you would have agreed that the parties should be independently advised. I thought you would have agreed to that because you know, as just about everyone else does, that there is always a weaker party in these types of negotiations. So I would be interested if Senator Cooney or the minister might like to advise as to what the anticipated costs and procedures would be for changing an agreement when one party does not want to change it. That may cast some light on the whole discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the last point you raised, Senator Cooney, my advice is that if you take what we are proposing in 63D(1)(c) and combine it with 63D(2), you, in effect, end up with the same sort of attention given to the matter as the court would give to consent orders. That, to me, seems appropriate. If you somehow believe that that is not correct, that we have been ill advised, I am sure we would be happy to listen. Senator Spindler has shifted his position a bit, and I have shifted mine a bit in order to come to some agreement here, partly through different understandings of what it was that we each wanted to achieve. If you are so convinced, then perhaps you could either offer an alternative or explain why the combination of those two does not end up the same as consent orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, you make the point that if you do this people will simply come to agreements on their own. What on earth is the matter with that? If people do happily come to agreements about what to do with their children, what is the problem?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but the point you are wanting to push, Minister, is that there is some benefit for those people in registering the plan.

If you are going to shift it above that&mdash;a flexible agreement between two parties who have the best interests of their child at heart&mdash;and make it a court order, then you have to have some sort of advice, especially for the weaker party, and, understandably, for the best interests of the child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That seems to me to be the appropriate arrangement. Do not try to implement a system where everybody who separates and divorces somehow comes to the conclusion that they must register their parenting plan. Why should they? If they do not have a problem with it, if they are happy that as time goes by they can resolve the disagreements they may have about changed circumstances, let them remain unregistered. We are talking about a different category&mdash;a category of people who have come, presumably, with some difficulty to this plan and want some confidence that the other party is going to stick to it. It can otherwise be described as wanting some consequences hanging on the agreement&mdash;that means rights and duties are affected. That means, Senator Cooney, you ought to be interested in the rights, duties and obligations of the weaker party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In dealing with this particular amendment&mdash;and as I said before, Senator Vanstone's is really based on the one that I have put forward&mdash;I have always been very conscious of the fact that we are making a decision on balance. I am not after creating a bonanza for lawyers or increasing the costs to people who want to go through a divorce. I am not at all reticent in saying that if we can keep the lawyers out, let's do it. But there is, I think, a genuine concern here about the power imbalance that could obtain where people are influenced unduly by the other party; where they are overshadowed by the knowledge of the personality of the other party; or where they have not got requisite knowledge, expertise and facility in negotiation. Even where they do have these things, I think it is important that the court does not renege on its obligation to give priority to the welfare of the child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are two other options or changes that I will float at this stage to see whether they find any favour with other people in the chamber&mdash;with Senator Vanstone or with the government. The first is in (b) where the amendment currently asks for `independent legal advice'. I wonder whether we could consider `independent advice by a court counsellor' as an alternative to `independent advice by the legal practitioner'. That would certainly address the cost question to a large extent. One would imagine that if a court counsellor is prepared to append her or his signature to the statement, they would have carefully considered the position that is being adopted by the party in becoming a signatory to the agreement. That may be one alteration that goes some way towards minimising the cost factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment that I would like to suggest is in (3) which currently reads, `The Rules of Court may deal with how the plan may be registered in a court.'. I wonder whether we can change that to, `The plan may be assessed by the court.' That means that the court could have the option of not going to a full hearing, but making a rule that the registrar of the court peruses the agreement on a range of however many checkpoints you want to establish to test it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that option would be open to the court. It does not exclude the court's capacity to have the case before it. I guess the rules could provide that if the registrar is unhappy or uncomfortable, the parenting agreement could be referred to the court for a full hearing. I would imagine that would be necessary in only very few cases. Just to formalise what I am saying, I propose an amendment to (b) to the effect that `legal' in line three be removed so that it reads, `with independent advice as to the meaning and effect of the plan and that is signed by the legal practitioner or court counsellor who provided that advice.'</PARA>

Whilst I do not have any intention of doing anything radical and voting against the approach of my party on this issue, I do want to float some of my concerns about this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there is one fundamental principle; that is, anybody ought to have access to the justice system should they wish, without engaging a solicitor. I say that as a solicitor, and I would say to the people who do so that they are foolish and stupid, but they ought to have that fundamental right. Those of us who have been engaged in Family Court trials where people are self-represented know how very tedious it can become. Nevertheless, that ought be a fundamental right. I stand by that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a question, I suppose, as to how much the government and legislation are to spoon-feed people. I know that my shadow Attorney-General talked about forms for wills that you can buy from a newsagent. I would agree with her. It is very foolish to make a will that way; and, at a later time, I have had to try to fix some of those wills in my office. But I would not be in favour of making those forms illegal and saying that you can only ever have a will if it is prepared for you by a legal practitioner. There is a fairly fundamental point in that and it is, I suppose, the basis on which I make my comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me to be somewhat incongruous that, if mum and dad are married or together, they can determine what is good for the children but if they then decide no longer to remain together, they can somehow, even if they want to, be no longer capable of determining what is in the best interests of their children. The reality is that the vast majority of parents do not use the facilities of the Family Court to determine issues of custody and other matters. They sort those things out for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the argument about the weaker party. But how far can we go to protect the weaker party? Chances are, if somebody is very dominant they will bully a person not to even go to court with a parenting plan. So those who are the real bullies will ensure it never gets to the court in the first place for the court to look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it can be shown that an order was made under duress then there are the provisions in the Family Law Act to undo that at a later stage. The plan that is being proposed in this bill is basically a plan on the basis of agreement between the parties. If agreement can be achieved, I would have thought that a clause, in a standard plan which says that there was no fraud or duress applied, might be an appropriate way of dealing with that. The rules of court may possibly determine the particular form that the registration ought to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite attracted to Senator Spindler's suggestion. Before any matter comes before the Family Court these days, the parties have to have a counselling session before the first mention date of the matter in the court. Therefore, a counsellor is already involved. It should not be beyond the wit of an independent counsellor to determine whether or not there is some power imbalance between the parties and whether somebody has been bulldozed into signing the parenting plan. As a result, Senator Spindler's amendment does have some merit. I would accept that as a compromise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My starting point would still be that, if mum and dad while they are together can come to an agreement on how their children ought to be looked after, if they separate and can still come to such an agreement why on earth would we not allow them to simply register that with a court?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the argument of the shadow Attorney-General (Senator Vanstone), that we are asking for the imprimatur of the court and, therefore, it would be appropriate for the court to satisfy itself that it is an appropriate plan. But, having said that, I would hope and wish that the court would not involve itself in any detailed analysis. The logical flowthrough would be that, if, just because they are separated, you are going to check up on parents who voluntarily come to the court with an agreement, why on earth do we not involve the courts when the parents are together? Why don't we worry about the weaker party within the family unit while it is still together?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That argument, if you work it backwards, has some very concerning aspects to it in relation to the family unit. As bad as families may be, I believe that they usually are the best place to bring up kids. Much as counsellors, lawyers, et cetera, may be well meaning, mum and dad usually know best. At the end of the day, if mum and dad can agree about the way the kids ought to be brought up, I would say that 99.9 per cent of the time that is the best way for it to go, especially for the children. If the kids know that mum and dad worked out this agreement together, and mum and dad are both happy with it, then I am sure their lives will be so much easier when they have contact with the parent with whom they do not reside on a full-time basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the suggestion made by Senator Spindler for proposed section 63D.(3): `The Rules of Court may deal with how the plan may be registered in a court.' I think you have suggested the deletion of the word `registered' and to replace it with `assessed.' I wonder whether, possibly, we ought to have both, because the rules of the court possibly ought to deal with the way that it is registered. I agree that, possibly, the rules of court ought to determine the way that it is assessed as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Spindler would be agreeable, my suggestion would be that we insert the words `assessed and' before the word `registered' in subparagraph (3). I hope then that the rules of the court would not make it too difficult for the way the court may register a plan. That is the only contribution that I wish to make on that. I trust that we may be able to get some agreement on that. I see that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) and the shadow Attorney-General are in deep discussion. I hope that some compromise on a bipartisan basis can be achieved. I have run out of wind, but I do not know if we have actually reached an agreement which might satisfy most people in the chamber. </PARA>

When a family is intact and not going through the traumatic stage of separation, of course there is no reason to intervene or get the court to take any interest in it unless, of course, the children are, for instance, abused. That difference is accepted.

I know that these amendments, in total, seek to maintain an involvement of both parties; the Democrats welcome that. Nevertheless, it is a traumatic period. Another situation is where the adults involved are concerned with setting themselves up and looking after their own interests in the post-separation period.

In the preamble to those agreements certain things have to be set out such as the date of the marriage, the age of the parties and the age of the children.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will clarify what I think is happening so we understand what is going on here. We have moved an amendment to try and ensure that both parties get some independent legal advice. That is the first thing we want. The second thing we want is for the court to be satisfied that the arrangements set out in the plan promote the interests of the child. There are two things to be looked at here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the first matter, Senator Spindler is now saying that it does not have to be independent legal advice and that it can be independent advice. As I understand it, he is saying that it could be a legal practitioner that offers that advice or it could be a court counsellor. He is suggesting that amendment because he is persuaded by Senator Cooney's argument&mdash;do not be so humble Senator Cooney and shake your head&mdash;that the cost to legal aid might be so phenomenal that we should not insist that lawyers come in at this stage and that a court counsellor has some experience in these matters, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the point I want to address. I would be interested in hearing the views of Senator Spindler, the minister and Senator Cooney when I rephrase what you are saying to see whether you still agree with it when it is put the other way. You are basically saying that you are happy to focus on the weaker party, and we all agree that it is in the best interests of the child that it be looked at. We might argue about the point at which that should happen, but we all agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask you now to focus on the question of both parties coming to make this agreement and there being a weaker party involved. You are happy for the rights, duties and obligations of the weaker party to be registered as a court order without that weaker party having independent legal advice. The consequence of saying yes to that is that you are happy to set up court counsellors as paralegals that can take over advising in custody and access law unless there is going to be a dog fight, or until there is a dog fight, and then the lawyers come and clean it up&mdash;and I realise that some people would say that the lawyers made it worse in the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the consequence of what you are doing is to say that in custody and access matters people need to get some advice and you frankly do not care if it is from a court counsellor, who might have training in social work or psychology&mdash;I am not sure what training they do have&mdash;but who, as I understand it, is not required to be a family law practitioner. You are happy for them to have that independent advice from someone on the basis of cost, which I understand. But what I see happening of a morning is a court counsellor with a list of 30 of these things going tick, tick, tick, tick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are happy with that, Senator Spindler, and if that is the way that we can get this amendment, we will agree. But I do want to isolate the fact that you are actually saying that you will allow non-legally trained people to give what is in essence legal advice. You do not make it non-legal advice because you scratch that word out here. That is what they need: advice as to their rights, duties and obligations if they sign an agreement and as to whether they could get a better deal for themselves if they held out further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are saying that it is satisfactory for court counsellors to give that advice. You are setting up a sort of paralegal profession for advice on custody and access matters provided the parties in the end agree and a family law practitioner might say that what they really mean is `provided the parties don't know any better'. Once they do know better, because they think they have been done over and could have got a better deal in the beginning, or once the circumstances change, then they will require legal advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I then put to you is: why do you not allow the court counsellor to advise later when there is some disagreement? Why is the court counsellor's capacity suitable to bring the parties to agreement but not satisfactory when that agreement falls apart? What skills do they not have at the later stage that you somehow think they had at the earlier stage? That is what I would be interested in. I think Senator Cooney might have an answer. </PARA>

I do not anticipate what Senator Spindler will say but I understood him to be saying that one way of giving strength to a weaker party would be to give some moral support, which a person who is not a lawyer would be able to do. So a party who comes into strained circumstances, who feels that they do not have the support they might otherwise have, can get that support through a non-lawyer.</PARA></TALK.START>

If somebody wants legal advice, they should be able to get it.

It is that compulsion on having legal advice that I thought Senator Abetz addressed very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember, this is in the circumstances of judicial proceedings. It is not an issue of people who need social help. They may need social help but this is not a position where people go for help in terms of their social position, their psychological position or any other position. This is about a couple who are going before the courts of this land and, as Senator Abetz said, the courts of this land have a particular function&mdash;that is, to dispose of disputes. We have to be very careful that we remember that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Weaker parties are an issue that has to be faced not only in the Family Court but also in courts generally. One of the great tragedies is that people plead guilty in magistrates courts day after day without legal advice, which has the consequence of imprisonment. There are problems with weaker parties and stronger parties. They should be balanced in so far as they can be. I think Senator Spindler would be the last to concede that people should not get legal advice if they want it. If they do not want it, and if they are happy to go ahead on this basis, why shouldn't they?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just crystallise my approach to this amendment having regard to previous speakers. In relation to the first part of Senator Spindler's amendment dealing with section 63D(1)(b), I would see the merit in that it affords the opportunity for a person to be advised independently by either a lawyer or a court counsellor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a person makes an application to a court in relation to custody, before the first turn date there is a requirement that they have to attend a court counsellor in any event. Here, Senator Spindler's amendment is saying that, if that is the case, and if the person wants to have the parenting plan approved by the court, why not have independent advice from a court counsellor? The person still has the choice of course as to whether they have legal advice or not. But that perhaps gives some aspect of choice. It reflects a situation which is in existence to some extent at the present time. Also, I think it could perhaps alleviate any potential burden placed on the legal aid resources, which are currently taxed to the limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that extent, I can see merit in it. I cannot agree with the deletion of section 63D(1)(c) which the minister mentioned. It states that the court must be satisfied that the arrangements set out in the plan are likely to promote the best interests of the child. I think it is important that that be kept in there and that it remain a guide&mdash;more than a guide: a beacon, as it were&mdash;to the court in how it exercises its powers under this section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there is an overarching requirement that the best interests of the child should be looked at, but it does not hurt to state the obvious. I know that we will come to this argument when we get to the Greens' amendments in relation to inserting the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. In any event, this is an area where the court is exercising its powers directly in relation to how children are looked after and how parents who have separated deal with how the children should be looked after. I think the inclusion of paragraph (c) is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the second part of Senator Spindler's amendment dealing with the registration and assessment of a plan and how the rules might cater for it: I am satisfied by the minister's answer that in the registration of a plan the rules of the court could provide for the provision of adequate information by which the court can be satisfied. That is self-regulating. In its own rules the court can state what it feels is necessary to provide for that aspect. By way of preamble it can say what the parties need to put in their plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not prescribe what sort of agreement they come to. It prescribes as a prerequisite for registration what information the parties bring to the court. That is essential. That is in the registration aspect. I think that that could well provide an adequate safeguard in relation to the court exercising its powers in this regard. On that basis, I would be quite happy with just the word `registered' remaining as is and the aspect of assessment not being included, but on the proviso that these rules will provide for that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a bit uncomfortable with narrowing the process simply to a form 12A process. It seems to me that the formulation that we have&mdash;the rules of the court may deal with how the plan may be registered in a court&mdash;gives the court the possibility to use the form 12A process at one stage, but it does not exclude the court saying, `If the form 12A discloses a problem we want to have it looked at by the court.' In other words, it is a little more flexible. I would be uncomfortable with simply limiting it to that process and setting it in concrete.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to ask a question. I would like the question to be confirmed by the officers. It is the question that was asked by Senator Ellison. In the formulation that we had before, where the rules of court may deal with how the plan may be registered in a court, it enables the court to make rules as to the manner in which the parenting plan is to be assessed. In other words, does it give the court the possibility to have a rule which says in the first instance that a form&mdash;call it 12A&mdash;will be assessed by the registrar, and then subsequently the court may say that it needs to come before the court if the registrar reports that the plan is not satisfactory? I would just like to clarify whether the wording `registered in a court' enables the court to make a rule that provides several options. </PARA>

But anyway, I think there is a common goal at least on these two sides, and I think Senator Spindler is in the cart as well on this. So let us try to work out the wording overnight between advisers and see if we can get that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect to your point, Senator Ellison, all I can say is that we are talking about two different concepts here. You are talking about imparting something in the process at the start; we have been resisting that in terms of external legal advice and all that. We what we have in the legislation as an alternative is subsection 63E(5), which states that the court must not enforce the child welfare provisions if it considers that to do so would be contrary to the best interests of a child. That has been our response so far, and we are obviously moving away from that in the discussions we have had in the last half hour or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I also say that we will finish up with an inconsistency here, because in the legislation, for instance, agreements for maintenance can be lodged without all this prerequisite of advice and whatever. Just recognise that we will be setting up a two-tier system: one in respect of child planning arrangements and another in respect of maintenance arrangements&mdash;both of which would encompass maintenance arrangements or could potentially do so. Anyway, that is the path the chamber wants to go down and we will try to facilitate the wording and, hopefully, come up with it by the morning.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I can do that as well. You have to look at this in the context of the totality of the picture&mdash;that is, some people choose to register; some don't. In terms of registration, the process that has been anticipated here is one that would allow for formal lodgment, for instance. It would only be when a person&mdash;parent or otherwise&mdash;had problems with the actual parenting plan being enforced that there would be capacity for the court to knock a plan out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 63(5) states that the court must not enforce the child welfare provision if it considers that to do so would be contrary to the best interests of the child.

Enforcement is the part where the court has a role to play when people are not happy with the enforcement capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this is not in isolation. We are talking about other aspects of this act, which have been in force for quite a long time, where the process allows for the automatic registration of forms of arrangements. It is only when they come a cropper that people then go back to court and seek to revisit them or not have some aspects of them enforced. For instance, the maintenance arrangements fall in that category. Remember that, when it comes to children&mdash;I would be hazarding a guess&mdash;a huge number of arrangements made in respect of them are not lodged in any formal way with the courts. It is a bigger picture. What the committee tried to do in its deliberations in putting this aspect up was to focus on the court having the capacity to intervene when people are not happy with what they may have committed themselves to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have to work out what you are trying to do here. The first point Senator Ellison raised relates to property.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When are you dealing with children, take it from me that it is an ongoing process. There is always a need to revisit how one handles the interaction between former spouses in respect of children.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point is that we are talking about a voluntary system. People do not have to register planning arrangements for children. You have to be careful that, in imposing a process which could be expensive and cumbersome, you may be driving a lot more people out of this net that you would want to be in it. There is some value not just for the people involved in their being able to have their agreements registered. For instance, some schools would like to have evidence of which parent they should contact so that children can be picked up.

<PARA>I had the pleasure of making a visit to this area earlier this year and was extensively briefed on the management and the challenges facing the wet tropics area by Mr Peter Hitchcock, the executive director. Andrew McKenzie, the manager of community relations, was able to spend some time with me showing me some areas which were of particular interest and I certainly appreciated the consideration that he showed. Also, among others, Dr Vicki Patmore, who is a program coordinator, was also able to brief me on a variety of aspects of the management of the wet tropics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report, I believe, is certainly one which many people who are interested in the heritage areas will be interested to read. There are some points in the report. I have not had a chance to read the report in full; but it is interesting to look at the interest that the wet tropics area is creating in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 29, the report looks at the number of visitors to the wet tropics area. For example, in 1993, a baseline visitor use survey estimated there were some 4.7 million visits to the wet tropics world heritage area and, of this, some 1.5 million visits, or 32 per cent, were by people on commercial tours and some 3.2 million were independent visitors; and 48 per cent of visits were made by local residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found my visit to the area most worthwhile. I commend the work done in the wet tropics area. I know that there are many challenges up there and it is a very large area to manage. I hope that more and more Australians have the chance to visit this quite unique part of our country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This report attempts to paint a rather positive picture of the state of the Department of Social Security. But, unfortunately for them, it is a picture with a large number of cracks. On a closer inspection of the report&mdash;it is a rather large report that we only received today along with about 70 other reports, as my colleague said&mdash;we find a lot of waste, and goals or aims which have not been met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This annual report comes hot on the heels of the Auditor-General's efficiency audit that was tabled last Tuesday, which exposed massive inefficiency and the potential to save millions upon millions of dollars. In fact, it said that in the range of $30 million to $80 million could be saved just through efficiency improvements within regional offices&mdash;the offices out there in the local communities. The audit report also revealed that if those efficiencies were taken on board and achieved, there would also be efficiencies in client services. So not only would there be savings in money but also the clients would not have to stand in queues, go from one queue to the other or fill out innumerable forms. There are a number of ways in which those savings could be made, and I talked about those when the Auditor-General's report was released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the report of the Department of Social Security where it refers to performance standards for 1994-95. We see, for example, that the national standard for teleservice centres is one minute from initial response to be referred to an action officer. In 1994-95, a target was set that 85 per cent of cases would at least get to an action officer in one minute. In 1993-94, the actual achievement was 57 per cent; this year, it was 38 per cent&mdash;they have gone down. Anybody who has tried to ring the Department of Social Security would know that you are just put on hold. The other day when I tried to ring up to make an inquiry&mdash;they did not know I was a senator&mdash;I was told, `You're in a queue and there's an 18-minute wait at least with 35 calls ahead of you.' So much for the one-minute response time! We have seen that in 1994-95 the achievement rate with the standard has gone down on the year before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standard of reply time for ministerial correspondence has also gone down. The 1994-95 target for answering parliamentary questions was 100 of them. In 1993-94 it achieved 83 and this year it was 70. The target for meeting the standard for financial recovery prosecutions was 70. In 1993-94 it achieved 58 and this year it was 47. This is a department that received a two per cent pay increase in anticipation of productivity gains. What were they going to do? They were going to be more efficient and they were going to have fewer sick leave days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tried to find out about absenteeism in the report. If I go to the index at the back, do I find absenteeism? No, I do not find anything about absenteeism. When I search through I find absenteeism on page 310. We were told in estimates that absenteeism was on average something like 10 days a year before that productivity payment of two per cent. The departmental representatives said, `We'll get back to eight per cent, Senator. That'll give us a $6 million saving. The productivity payment cost $12 million. So we'll get half of it from getting our absenteeism back by two days.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what did Social Security do? It went up to something like 12 days on average. For that productivity payment we got two more days of sick leave on average. We see in the report that the department says it is concerned about the increasing levels of absenteeism. It looks as though the department really has not got very far with absenteeism either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a very happy report. I suppose the only area where I have seen some improvement is with the number of overpayments which were waived `due to administrative error and were in good faith'. Last year, the overpayments waived were $10.1 million and this year, $5.4 million&mdash;we have still had $15 million worth of errors in two years. The only place where I can see any gain in Social Security is in overpayments. The people handling that area ought to have credit where credit is due, but the rest of it leaves a lot to be desired. It says that, after 13 years, this Labor government has yet to bring in efficiencies that would make the Department of Social Security an efficient organisation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to draw attention to the question of consultants employed by departments. In this case, there has been a considerable decrease in the consultant numbers and costs compared with the Defence annual report for the previous year. The total paid for consultants in the latest financial year to 30 June 1995 was $12.5 million. Unfortunately, the report does not detail the comparable figure for the previous year, but it does state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The significant decrease in the consultant numbers and costs compared to the Defence Annual Report 1993-94 is due to the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the definitions for Consultants and Professional Service Providers (Contractors), were more clearly defined during the FY 1994-95 and approved by the Attorney-General's Department. This redefinition was to better reflect the reporting requirements and remove the confusion that previously existed in separating contractors and consultants.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say in passing that it seems to me extraordinary that there would be no strict comparison using the same criteria with the previous year so that the Senate can take a view of whether there has been either a genuine increase or a genuine decrease. I think it is grossly improper of the department to fail to do so. The next matter in justification for the significant decrease is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the Defence Financial Management Information System, which records all Defence payments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>has simply lumped together, in terms of numbers, the total contract value of consultants because&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . In previous annual reports, the total contract number value was reported, thus showing possible amounts payable over future years.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, rather than individual years. As I say, it would be nice if we had a strict comparison. This leads me to the general question as to why on earth there is no list of consultants. This report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total number of consultants engaged has been reported, as opposed to individual consultancies reported in previous years . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This appears to follow the decision by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet that there be changes made in the way organisations report various matters in their annual reports. One of these is to take consultancy services out of the annual report and make it material available on request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee of which I am a member&mdash;the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee&mdash;expressed concern about this tactic. It is a tactic which clearly is aimed at not having these matters so up front as they have been in the past. Sure, they are available on request, but it seems to me that this is information that should be very publicly available either in the annual report or in an attachment to the annual report. In the estimates report of our committee last year&mdash;when this matter came up before us&mdash;we said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the information that may be held separately instead of included in annual reports consists of basic orientating and cross referencing information, which would add only a few pages to most annual reports such as relevant legislation and information on statutory authorities, non-statutory bodies and government companies in the portfolio. The committee considers that to omit this information from annual reports is a retrograde step. For example, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration has several times commented on the difficulty of knowing what government controlled companies exist. The new rule in practice is likely to make it harder.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt about that. This new rule is offensive. There is a failure to provide details of consultancy services in annual reports. The departments are taking this prime ministerial departmental edict that they need not report as an instruction not to report. That is an improper interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the departments to include this vital information in their reports in future or the Senate might be asked to take action to require departments to provide material, if not in their annual reports at least in attachments to their annual reports when they are tabled in the Senate. Naturally, I will be making that recommendation through our party room, in the hope that the Procedure Committee will require departments to come clean.

<PARA>I wish to make some comments in relation to this report. In particular, I wish to comment on what the report says about the east coast tuna and billfish fishery on pages 29 to 32. I am glad that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) is in the chamber because these are matters on which he should have some knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to advise him that what is contained in the report is not accurate and is, I believe, deliberately misleading. It is not the minister's fault that it is misleading. I believe that the account in relation to the east coast tuna and billfish fishery which is contained in this report has been written in such a way as to gloss over the fact that AFMA has refused to act on one of the recommendations of the East Coast Tuna Management Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At page 31, the report says very clearly that the objective was to develop and implement a management plan for the east coast tuna and billfish fishery under the Fisheries Management Act 1991. It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of major management issues were unresolved in the ECT&amp;BF and this led to a delay in the finalisation of a draft Management Plan for the fishery. Part of the difficulty in finalising future management arrangements was the sudden growth in the pelagic longline sector, in terms of new vessels entering the fishery through activation of latent effort and an expansion of commercial effort in the Coral Sea fishery.</PARA>
<PARA>It then says, and this is important:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ECTUNAMAC addressed these issues through extensive public consultation and lengthy deliberations. June 1995 marked the finalisation of these issues and the recommencement of the drafting of a Management Plan for the fishery. A revised date of June 1996 has been set for the introduction of the Management Plan.</PARA>
<PARA>This is deliberately misleading, because ECTUNAMAC made a number of recommendations to AFMA in June of this year. I think the press release came out on about 21 June. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those recommendations related to the taking of billfish by commercial tuna operators. That recommendation was very clear. The recommendation was that commercial tuna operators should be prohibited from taking billfish anywhere, either inside any of the management zones or outside any of the management zones&mdash;for example, inside or outside area E&mdash;if they were operating as commercial tuna fishermen; the reason being that we have seen a spate of cases where people have come into port with marlin in the boat and have said, `We caught the marlin outside area E.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AFMA has very limited resources to enforce the regulations. There is nobody on the boats. It would be ridiculous to expect somebody to be on the boats all the time, but there are no spot checks on operators and what they do in the areas. Anybody could make up this story and get away with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation went to AFMA, although I understand the committee was divided on the matter along the lines of self-interest. AFMA has done absolutely nothing about it but defer it and defer it. It has accepted the other recommendations, but not this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to know how this report can say that June 1995 marked the finalisation of these issues. The issues have not been finalised. AFMA has not accepted the recommendation. This is, quite plainly put, a lot of hogwash. If we are going to allow AFMA to put this sort of nonsense in a report when they know it is not the case, I believe the whole system falls down. </PARA>

I hope Senator Bob Collins will take note of my concerns. He is a man of his word.

<PARA>This document is always awaited in this chamber just to see how many more consultants this government can stack on the staffs of ministers. It is an interesting issue&mdash;when a person is a consultant and why he is not employed as a usual member of staff; and some of those consultants have been on a minister's staff or the staff of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for three or four years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My memory is that the Fraser government employed some three consultants in its final year. This document lists for the period 1994-95 and beyond some 49 consultants&mdash;a huge addition to the ministerial staff. When we go through these consultants&mdash;and I do not want to spend too much time of the Senate&mdash;we see, for example, that Senator Gareth Evans has employed a consultant, a Mr Kenneth Berry.

Yes, Senator Collins, there have been quite a number of books produced by Senator Evans, at great expense to the taxpayer. If this government wants to produce papers, the consultants should be employed to produce white papers on government policy, not to produce CVs for Senator Evans to get another job with the United Nations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to make some remarks about what is becoming an unseemly debate between Sydney, on the east coast of this great nation, and Perth, on the other side of this great nation, over where the real little Aussie battler, the good ship <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia II</EMPHASIS>, should rest. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia II</EMPHASIS>, having scored what&mdash;in the opinion of this senator&mdash;was one of the greatest sporting victories in the history of the world, not just to mention Australia, clearly is not being allowed to rest in peace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She has, of course, been found a home in the National Maritime Museum in Sydney&mdash;a most appropriate place for the old <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia II</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and certainly a lot of money has been put into creating that home for her. That home having been found for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia II</EMPHASIS>, we find that in the Creative Nation statement&mdash;which was launched by the minister, Michael Lee, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) earlier this year&mdash;and without any consultation with the board of the National Maritime Museum, the decision was made to relocate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia II</EMPHASIS> to Fremantle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you and I are both proud Western Australians. Some might certainly call me parochial, and I think even you might be called that as well. I think we would have to say that Fremantle would make a great home for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia II</EMPHASIS>. But tonight I want to propose an alternative answer to the&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Senator Collins, not Alice Springs. You can have your Todd River Regatta, but that does not match sailing off Fremantle. I am going to float tonight&mdash;excuse the pun&mdash;a proposal that would ensure that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia II</EMPHASIS> ends up exactly where her designer, Ben Lexcen, and the builder of that yacht, Steve Ward, another proud Western Australian, originally intended that yacht to be&mdash;that is, in the water.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are going to float that idea, are you?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have. I have used that pun already, Senator Baume. You missed it. It does not get better, so I will leave it at that. The proposal&mdash;and it is only a broad proposal at this stage, and it is something that I have discussed privately with Kay Cottee, who is actively advocating that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia II</EMPHASIS> stay in Sydney&mdash;is that, under the auspices of the National Maritime Museum, we create an Australia II foundation quite similar in structure to the Endeavour Foundation, which is now operating the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Endeavour</EMPHASIS> replica that is moving around the ports of Australia and attracting very large crowds wherever she goes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That foundation would be charged with the responsibility of putting <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia II</EMPHASIS> back in the water and supporting <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia II</EMPHASIS> with an appropriate jinker or trailer&mdash;to use a term which most people would understand&mdash;or an appropriate piece of prime mover type equipment, to move <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia II</EMPHASIS> from port to port, because she is certainly not designed to sail at great lengths at sea. She was unlike the old America's Cup yachts. The modern 12-metre yachts are designed to go out and sail for short periods in offshore courses, but they are certainly not designed for overnight expeditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That equipment would be provided so that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia II</EMPHASIS> could be moved from port to port&mdash;not only capital city ports but also the many great regional ports we have around Australia&mdash;and, indeed, be recommissioned so that she could sail. I am proposing that the federal government would allocate to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia II</EMPHASIS> foundation that I am proposing an amount of money equal to that which would have been involved under the Creative Nation proposal to meet the expenses of shifting <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia II</EMPHASIS> across to Fremantle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important aspect of the proposal I put here tonight is that any sailing boat that is locked up in a museum is certainly not going to provide the inspiration or the appreciation of Australia's maritime or sporting history that a yacht that is in active service will provide. I was reminded in a conversation with a good friend of mine from Sydney just a few minutes ago that at Newport at the bicentenary of the New York Yacht Club where they held a regatta in the middle of last year, virtually all the great United States entrants in the America's Cup for the past many decades were out there racing each other: the Courageouses, the Stars and Stripes&mdash;all the boats going back some decades, but still in active service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not to say that Australia II is in the same category with those; she is a remarkable yacht which achieved a remarkable sporting feat. For Australia, she is the only yacht that has been able to win the America's Cup in the United States. She broke the longest running hold on an international sporting trophy in the history of mankind. So Australia II is special. But I believe the great benefit of having Australia II move around from port to port is that so many more people will be able to appreciate the beauty and history of the boat and, very importantly, will gain the inspiration that Australia II can provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though parochial Western Australians such as me like to claim the America's Cup win as a Western Australia victory, it is simply not accurate. There were many great Western Australians who contributed to the victory. If it was not for the vision of Alan Bond and his dedication to the pursuit of the holy grail of yachting over so many decades of his life, it would not have been possible. If it had not been for the dedication of other Western Australians such as the boat builder, Steve Ward; John Longley or Chink as he is known to his sailing mates and who was involved in all of the challenges; Skippy Lissiman; Ken Judge and Scotty McAllister&mdash;and I have probably forgotten some of my Western Australian sailing friends&mdash;we would not have won the cup off Newport on that famous and memorable morning in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there were contributions made by great Australians from other parts of the country. We would not have won the cup if it had not been for the Victorian John Bertrand who was the exceptional skipper of that boat. We would not have won without the incredible commitment to the pursuit of that trophy by Sir James Hardy&mdash;from Senator Bolkus's state&mdash;over all his life. There were Sydneysiders such as Ben Lexcen&mdash;I have already mentioned him&mdash;a brilliant and great Australian, Hugh Treharne, the tactician and sail maker and another great Australian; and Phil Smidmore. I have probably forgotten lots, but I make the point that it was an Australian effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember those ads that Westpac ran with the great silver spanner that it designed to unbolt the cup. It would not have been possible without the national sponsorship of organisations such as Westpac. It was a national effort and I believe that rather than having a fight between Sydney and Perth about where Australia II should rest, we should look very closely at the idea of establishing this foundation so that Australia II can become a live exhibit, rather than gathering dust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of practical difficulties with the proposal, but none that cannot be overcome with the same sort of dedication that was required to win the America's Cup in the first place. Clearly, it will require maintenance and a good crew of people to ensure that the yacht is preserved for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I envisage that Australia II could be used for sail training purposes and to inspire younger Australians to increase sports participation. Also, programs could be developed to ensure that disadvantaged young Australians could have access to Australia II and share the inspiration that win gave us back in 1983. There are many young Australians who will not remember those bleary nights and early mornings ten years ago when we watched the images of Australia II crossing the finish line in the fog to win that great trophy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other great advantage&mdash;and I will conclude on this because my time in the debate is about to expire&mdash;is that Australia II being mobile could be taken to strategic points in Australia where other great events may be on and where Australia II could add to Australia's international reputation. One of the most significant of those will clearly be the Olympics in the year 2000 in Sydney. I think it is only sensible that she be there for that time. I commend this idea to the Senate and hope that the National Maritime Museum, all political parties, the federal government, the governments of Western Australia and New South Wales, and the private sector will give this idea very strong consideration. I think it could be good for our nation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (7.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to continue some remarks that I commenced on an earlier occasion regarding the Western Australian Court government's first wave industrial relations legislation. In particular, I want to examine the principles that underline it and the experience of workers in my state under those policies. I do this because of the endorsement expressed by Mr Howard, the coalition leader, in the parliament recently of those principles, and the expectation that federal Liberal policy will mirror the Western Australian example.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight, I would like to give an example of an experience in a private child-care centre in Western Australia, which I will refer to as example F. Workers were previously employed under the Children's Services (Private) Award 1990, but have been subject to offers of workplace agreements throughout this year. They have been spreading throughout private child-care centres&mdash;mainly to untrained workers because, in fact, trained workers are in high demand and enjoy considerable bargaining powers as a result. These workplace agreements have been used to target young, untrained women who are readily available in the current employment market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the workplace agreements offered reflect different wage rates, many see the offer as a move to free up workers' terms and conditions as private centres look to expand their opening hours to include Saturdays and Sundays, and evenings. One of the major problems in this industry is that under the legislation employers are allowed to employ persons as casuals for periods of 10, 15, or 20 years. There is no limit on the time a person can be employed as a casual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that, employees are not entitled to sick leave, annual leave or any of the other normal conditions of employment that we have come to expect as part of the normal minimum entitlements of workers in Australia. In addition, the agreements seek to downgrade other conditions or eliminate them in the workplace agreement as compared with the award. These are having a major impact on the income that workers can earn under this arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ordinary hours of work under the award are 38 hours per week between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. Shifts are up to a maximum of eight hours. Work in excess of those hours is paid as overtime. Under the workplace agreement, ordinary hours are increased to 40 hours per week, to be worked at any time, Monday to Friday inclusive. There is no time limit on the length of the shift. Under the award, overtime rates are paid where more than eight hours are worked in a day, or where more than an average of 38 hours are worked in a week. Rates start at time and a half for the first two hours followed by double time. The workplace agreement provides for time off in lieu where more than 40 hours are worked in a week, but there is no overtime rate or, in fact, any wage rate for overtime hours. So, if you work more hours, there is no overtime provision at all. The only option under this agreement is that you may get time off in lieu. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example of a woman, say, called Paula who is an untrained child-care worker. She signed a workplace agreement because that is what was offered at her workplace. It seemed that it was not going to make too much difference because the hourly rates were fairly similar. However, two weeks later her shifts were changed from eight hours from Monday to Friday to 10 hours on any four days of the week, Monday to Friday. The award provided that for working these shifts she would have received $432.60 per week, including the overtime rate. Under the workplace agreement, Paula earned only $391.50, representing nearly a 10 per cent loss in her income as a result of her signing the workplace agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of public holidays, penalty rates are double time and half under the award, but public holidays are not included in the workplace agreement. The workplace agreement is for a period of five years with annual wage reviews, but the basis of the review is not detailed. The 17 1/2 per cent loading on annual leave&mdash;which is contained in the award&mdash;is not contained in the workplace agreement, which pays annual leave only at the ordinary rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of sick leave, while both the award and the agreement provide for 10 days paid sick leave per year, leave not taken accumulates under the award, but it is forfeited each year under the workplace agreement. Generally, the award does not require medical certificates for an absence of two days or less. Medical certificates must be provided under the workplace agreement for any absence, including part of a day. One of the largest sections in the workplace agreement relates to the conditions that apply to unpaid annual leave. What it recognises is that a large majority or a large number of these workers will be classified as casuals and will not be entitled to annual leave, no matter how long they work for one employer. The document goes to great lengths to set out the conditions under which people will be allowed access to the only leave they will be able to get, which is unpaid annual leave. That is another example of what is occurring to workers in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, these workers are mainly young women without any particular training. They are at the mercy of an employer saying, `You either sign this workplace agreement and accept these conditions or there is no job here for you.' There is no choice for them to go onto an award. In fact, as I highlighted earlier, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia is sending out to employers wage rates which contain information of how to pay under the award. But in a big box at the top of the wages schedule, it says, `You can replace this award with a workplace agreement.' Therefore they are making sure that employers understand that they do not have to pay the award in Western Australia; they do not have to be bound by these minimum wage rates; they can just replace them with workplace agreements. The schedule, of course, makes no mention of minimum employment conditions; it just advises them that if they do not like the award they can get out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time available to me, I want to address some of the Liberal Party paranoia about the ALP television advertisement, launched in Western Australia recently, about the Liberals' policy on industrial relations. The coalition has continued to assert that it is Labor's lies, but I have here the transcript of what the ad actually says. It makes a number of assertions, but there are two major ones. Firstly, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Court Liberal government has set the minimum weekly wage at $317.10. A family can't live on that!</PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, I do not think anyone would dispute that. The Western Australian minister had a minimum wage recommended to him by the Industrial Relations Commission and by an independent expert. He cut the recommended rate&mdash;reduced it and set it at $317.10, despite the recommendation from his own expert and from the independent umpire of the Industrial Relations Commission. So I do not see why people would be upset by that assertion. The second major assertion is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Penalty rates. Sick leave. Unfair dismissal protection. And Superannuation . . . could all go&mdash;with no compensation.</PARA>
<PARA>These are under a heading `Under a John Howard Liberal Government'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to debate that assertion in this chamber at any time with those opposite. The exhibits that I table today of workplace agreements that are actually in force in Western Australia prove that penalty rates, sick leave and any entitlements to overtime and shift penalties have all been eroded under the Western Australian Liberal government's industrial relations system. I have set out in chapter and verse where those workers have had those entitlements to penalty rates, annual leave and sick leave removed from them. They have been made to sign workplace agreements; they have been told to sign or resign or told, `Sign or you don't get the job.' They no longer have paid annual leave, penalty rates or paid sick leave. That is a fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the secrecy surrounding the Court Liberal government's workplace agreements&mdash;it is very hard to get copies of these things because they have very strict secrecy provisions&mdash;it is on the record in this parliament of what has occurred to workers in Western Australia. For the Liberal Party to take genuine offence at the ad, they have to establish that it is not true. Clearly, it is true: registered workplace agreements take away workers' penalty rates and sick leave and reduce their unfair dismissal protection. In terms of superannuation, I am not sure what the Liberal Party is saying. But certainly the second wave industrial legislation introduced into the state parliament attacks the worker's right to choose. It gives the employer a veto over the choice of superannuation funds by employees, particularly over any collective choice that they currently enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last assertion in the ALP advertisement is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Working people simply can't afford to go backwards with the Liberals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite frankly, that is established by the record. John Howard has endorsed the WA principles and the WA industrial relations approach. It has been proven that people are suffering, that their incomes are being reduced and that the things that we took for granted in this country, such as paid sick leave and paid annual leave, are not being granted to workers, some of whom have worked five or 10 years with the same employer. They have lost those rights under the Liberals' IR policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak about the Affirmative Action Agency annual report for 1995 which was tabled in the parliament yesterday. In that report it was claimed by the Affirmative Action Agency that the RSPCA, of which I am the patron, had not complied with section 19 of the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act because it did not provide adequate information in its progress report. In fact, the RSPCA did provide the information in consultation with an adviser, R.B. Bailey of Employee Relations Pty Ltd, who advised that the information provided would be adequate. But the Affirmative Action Agency appeared not to be happy with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 3(4) of the act states that employees are not required to take any action which is incompatible with the principle that employment matters should be dealt with on merit. I think everyone would agree that in this case&mdash;I will elaborate on it in a minute&mdash;people have been dealt with on merit within the RSPCA and that there are more affirmative action programs going there than just about anywhere else. The RSPCA has consulted with the Affirmative Action Agency all through this process and it can only be assumed that even the best results are not good enough for the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Affirmative Action Agency was established in the main to `improve career opportunities for women in business'. On any scenario the RSPCA provides more career opportunities than any business or charity. Why is the RSPCA being singled out when, clearly, it is a good affirmative action organisation? Far from being praised for its efforts, it is being labelled as a non-complying organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RSPCA employs some 190 people, of whom 120 are female. The organisation has eight shelters and clinics around New South Wales, all of which are headed and managed by women. The RSPCA employs more women at all levels of management than does anyone else. For example, it has a board of nine people of whom five are women. The chair of the board is a woman. By the way, the executive director of the RSPCA is a male but the deputy director is a female. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RSPCA has been branded by the Richard Morecroft program as `keeping women in the "pink ghetto"'. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Affirmative Action Agency have named organisations, including the RSPCA and NBN Newcastle . . . </PARA>
<PARA>These extracts have come from Media Monitors. Another item is from an Adelaide radio station which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than 100 Australian companies have been publicly exposed for not complying with affirmative action programmes. Among the companies named were Franklins, RSPCA, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The RSPCA has been mentioned in other articles. For example, an item on the AAP wire service states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But AAA director Catherine Harris warned that too many women were still stuck in the "pink ghetto" of low paid, unskilled and unappreciated employment.</PARA>
<PARA>I take the agency to task over that as far as the RSPCA is concerned. There are more women than men working in the organisation. There are more women than men in the top levels of management of that organisation. I think the agency has got it wrong in some ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has an effect on charity organisations like the RSPCA. A letter signed by Catherine Harris, the Director of the Affirmative Action Agency, arrived yesterday at the same time as this report was being tabled. The third paragraph of that letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government has a policy of contract compliance. The effect of this policy is that Commonwealth Government departments and agencies will not purchase goods or services from your organisation and your organisation is also ineligible to apply for specified forms of industry assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>This organisation is being discriminated against because of a report that I believe has been wrongly put together. It has been assumed that the RSPCA will not be eligible for industry assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has put the RSPCA in a very difficult position. This organisation relies on donations. It looks after the welfare of animals in New South Wales. One of the other patrons besides myself is the Premier of New South Wales. There are three patrons of that organisation. I believe the RSPCA has been defamed by this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There a lot of nice people in the community who like to give donations to the RSPCA&mdash;there are lots of women who like to give donations&mdash;and if this inference has been placed on it by the Affirmative Action Agency then those donations may not come in as freely as they did in the past. I believe the only way the damage from this defamatory attack can be eliminated is for the Affirmative Action Agency to publicly apologise to Charles Wright, the Executive Director of the RSPCA in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report should be put together using the facts. The facts are that the RSPCA employs 190 people of which 120 are female and 70 are males. The chairman of the board is a female. The managers of all the clinics around New South Wales are females. I believe they have complied with the thrust of the affirmative action legislation. I do not think the RSPCA should have been singled out the way it was. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the adjournment debate tonight to firstly express some concerns about what I read in the paper yesterday concerning some clergy signing a letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) relating to activities of old-growth logging or logging of native forests. I am somewhat amazed at the 18 people who signed this particular letter. I am very pleased to see that the churches essentially have distanced themselves from that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me in this debate on the forest industry and the use of native forests, be they old-growth or any age, is the fact that a particular group of conservatives or green groups have chosen to try and employ and maybe cajole certain people within the church to lend support to their argument. I think that that is a very sad and sorry state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that this is a very important debate. To go to that end to try and gain assistance for your cause is unfair on many members of the public in this country. It is a very difficult issue to understand and one that needs a lot of explaining. I do not think they have been fair on the people that they have sought to get involved in this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very pleasing to see that some church leaders have come out and distanced themselves from this position. I think Archbishop Eric D'Arcy from Tasmania made a very pertinent point when he said that there is a serious onus of proof on anyone who wants to put an end to another person's employment. Quite frankly, I think that the people who signed the letters that went to the two leaders missed the point with regard to the role of Christianity which they seek to espouse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jesus Christ was a carpenter. I am sure at that time in history that the wood that Jesus Christ used to work with came from native forests and probably old trees. I am not quite sure whether they are taking a hypocritical stance or whether they have been misled into lending support to a campaign that is currently in the public fora. I think it is appropriate to read parts of the letter into the record. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear to us that Australia's old-growth forests are both ecologically precious and of great natural beauty . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That defies the principle I spoke about before because it was in the early days that we used much more than we use today in terms of a per capita operation. They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are also home to rare and endangered species. As such, they mirror the creativity of God.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again I remind them of the fact that many human beings in the early days relied very heavily on the use of timber for their homes. I do not think it is a sin to provide your family and yourself with a home whether it be built from timber or some other material. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, to continue to log them for whatever purpose must be considered ethically and even morally wrong.</PARA>
<PARA>I raise with those people&mdash;and not the churches generally because they have generally distanced themselves from this particular letter and the claims in it&mdash;that if it is morally wrong, when they go to the church in which they conduct their sermons they should have a look around them and study the furniture and fittings within the church. They are very beautiful and in a majority of cases would have been made from timber&mdash;timber that has come from old-growth or native forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The signatories to the letter also said that they were speaking as individuals and were not giving an official view of the church. That is good because it would be very concerning if it was an official position of a church, as Archbishop D'Arcy said, to take the position of putting an end to a person's employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it is a sad state of affairs that at least some members or clergy of the church have become entwined in this national debate with regard to what we do in terms of the preservation of our forests on the one hand and the utilisation of them on the other. I do not think those people would have necessarily signed the letter had they been fully versed and fully aware of all the circumstances and all the parts of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be recognised by all of Australia that this government has embarked upon a process that will put in place the world's most comprehensive representative and reserved stands of forests vis-a-vis European settlement in this country. It will set a world standard of 15 per cent of forests with regard to after European settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, we are endeavouring to deliver to the people working and the companies operating in the forest industry an industry that is both sustainable and can actually be developed into a bigger and better industry. We need to do that because we know that there is an ever increasing demand for timber product and, I stress, an ever decreasing capacity to meet that demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is essentially just a small supplier in the world timber market yet we have the capacity to far better utilise the forests that grow in this country whether they be native forests or, indeed, whether they be plantation forests. We have a capacity to increase markedly the plantation forests and ultimately see them developed as a replacement for native forest harvesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mind you, we have not been without our mistakes. We have seen in many areas many forest types wiped out of existence. That is very unfortunate and very sad but we are making the right moves, albeit many people will disagree with that. This country is a democracy. I accept the right even of the 18 clergy who signed the letter to express a view. But I think it is unfortunate that they have chosen to express the view they have in the way they have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, as senators will know, is considering the issue of woodchip licences. The people of Australia generally do not like to export woodchips because of the perception that has been created by a very successful public campaign. Nevertheless, it is an integral part of an overall forest operation that ensures that we can utilise to the nth degree the wood we take from the forest. We have the capacity to much improve the way in which we utilise the wood we take from our forests and also much increase the value that is placed upon those trees that we take from the forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government finally makes its decision with regard to how we issue the new woodchip licences for 1996, it is imperative that that fact is fully taken account of and we issue those licences in a way that will maximise the social and economic benefit not only to this country but also to each state as each state has different forest industry applications. I would just like to say in closing that I hope the people who signed the letter will reconsider their position in light of the concern that has been expressed by the churches themselves and by other leaders within the church. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I want to say that I am very concerned about the fact that the new reporting requirements imposed by the Department of Finance on various Commonwealth departments, such as the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, mean that the list of Australian organisations and people receiving grants is no longer published. For example, the sports rorts would not be publicly presented to this parliament under the new rules that apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned consultancy services being hidden under the new rules but now we have the situation where, for example, the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories has a page in its annual report headed `Material available on request' and underneath is the word `grants'. They have decided not to print, for example, the $1,700,000 provided to 61 national state and regional conservation organisations this year. All we get is the fact that these grants are being made. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Details are available from the Department on request.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, one should not have to ask and wait to find out from the department what these sorts of grants are. As a general reporting principle it is grossly inadequate simply to say what the grants are for this year because one wants to see the comparison with the previous year. In this annual report that comparison is not given. For example, the department states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Details of consultants engaged . . . are available from the Department on request. The total number of consultancies engaged was 349 at a total cost of $8 609 628.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no comparison and, as I said, no list of who they were. This is of particular importance because I noticed last Sunday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> stated in an article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New reporting rules are helping Canberra bureaucrats hide the number of consultants hired&mdash;despite a report showing they cost a staggering $342 million last year with their numbers rising by almost 500 per cent in the past decade.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt this is the year of the consultant. It has also been the decade of grants, particularly grants to people who are `friendly' to the Labor Party. We have seen continual grants which effectively bind votes, and they are not to be revealed in the future. </PARA>
