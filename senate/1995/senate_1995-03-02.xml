<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These three bills, in each case, are bills which were introduced into the House of Representatives last year. They, however, are bills that have come into the Senate in this sitting.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These three bills fall into a category, as I am sure senators would be aware, that has been of some concern to the government. There have been discussions with the opposition, the minor parties and the Independent in the Senate in relation to this anomaly, and I believe it is an anomaly. I think it is an unintended consequence, in that sense, of the cut-off motion. We are planning to progress those discussions, and senators would be aware of a notice of motion that has been put down to deal with this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is dealing with the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994. Before I refer in principle to that bill, I want first of all to refer to what was said last night in the chamber by Senator Chamarette. I understand that the matters to which she referred are ones which have been around the place for a considerable number of years. I thought the type of material that was advanced by Senator Chamarette in support of the suggestion being made about an NVE category had well and truly been canvassed before. Those who have been promoters of that have been well and truly identified as having an interest in that particular endeavour, if I can call it such.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for the Senate to know a few facts. I understand and admit that it is not the view of Senator Chamarette, in advancing the proposition that has been advanced principally by the pornography industry itself, the X-rated video industry itself, that there be a NVE classification and that all material currently in the X category go into the NVE category. But that is the view that has been expressed by the X-rated video materials industry. In justification for that, it is indicating three things: firstly, the material in the X category is not violent; secondly, the material is not harmful; and, thirdly, there are eminent persons, such as Dr Paul Wilson, who believe that this material should be classified as NVE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal first of all with the latter proposition in respect of Dr Paul Wilson. Senator Chamarette referred to the newsletter <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Institute of Criminology: Trends and Issues No. 9</EMPHASIS> of December 1987 in support of what she was saying. That issue indicated that there had been a study completed by the institute about this matter. In subsequent examinations of Dr Wilson and the Institute of Criminology, it was found that the study was a search of the literature. It did not conduct any in-depth study at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article was by Dr Paul Wilson and Mr Stephen Nugent. Dr Paul Wilson, in that article, relied upon, to some extent, arguments against the findings of the Meese Commission. The Meese Commission, the United States commission into prostitution and pornography ordered by US Attorney-General Meese, found that material of a similar character to that which is contained in the X category has harmful effects. Dr Wilson attacked that as being unfounded and used as his support for that attack Messrs Nobile and Nadler. It is all footnoted in the paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Institute of Criminology: Trends and Issues No. 9</EMPHASIS>. What is not footnoted, however, is who Nobile and Nadler were. Philip Nobile was at that time the editorial director of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Penthouse Forum</EMPHASIS> in the United States and Eric Nadler was its senior editorial director. Very impartial people, I would have thought, for an academic in the Institute of Criminology to rely upon in support of what he was saying! So I think that is pretty well dead and buried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point goes to the question of harm. The Joint Select Committee on Video Materials discussed this matter quite substantially over a long period. Prior to that, the Senate Select Committee on Video Materials had done so. We received evidence to the effect that the habitual viewing of the type of material that is contained in the X category engenders a callous and manipulative orientation towards women. Quite an amount of evidence was given to us and to subsequent hearings, which is to be found in the archives of the committee. Those who suggested that there was no such effect included Robby Swan, the lobbyist for the X-rated pornography industry. That same person is not beyond some dissembling. He has been saying over a period of time that this material is not directed at the male population and does not objectify women; that it is also aimed at women&mdash;that they love it. This has been his approach for some considerable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to see in what I thought to be a serious journal&mdash;which turned out to have been conned&mdash;a statement by a Caroline Sweetly.

I thought: I have seen her somewhere before. I asked a question in a meeting of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards, inquiring into the standards relevant to the supply of services utilised in telecommunications technology, on 20 April 1993 of Mr Swan about Caroline Sweetly. He eventually admitted that it was his photograph&mdash;he was dressed up as Caroline Sweetly. It was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">B and T</EMPHASIS> magazine, page 19, of 17 August 1990.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that Senator Margetts would be involved in any of this. Of course she would not. The first matter she raised related to the type of material that is contained in X-rated material being non-violent. It could possibly be physically non-violent. As I have said, I have seen much of this X-rated material. It may be physically non-violent to a certain extent, but one I can remember was on the borderline of being forced sexual intimacy. I outlined yesterday what the joint select committee described this material as. The committee report stated at paragraph 13.46:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dominant theme of the material is that it objectifies and commodifies women rather than treating women as free and responsible initiators of human activity. The material in this category, although non-violent, treats women as sexual commodities to arouse the sexual desires of its target audience. Thus sexual intercourse is typically depicted as a mechanical act devoid of love or human consequences&mdash;fellatio and cunnilingus are explicitly and voyeuristically portrayed as is masturbation, ejaculation, penetration of the female anus and diverse acts, other acts or fetishes.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not go into what it contains. It goes on to say in paragraph 13.49:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women are often depicted as sexually malleable for the purposes of satisfying male sexual desires. This is sometimes manifested in themes involving workplace sexual favours. Women are frequently depicted as eager for sexual experience of any kind and ever ready for an opportunity for sexual activity. This is frequently manifested in the group sex scenes depicting diverse sexual activity, which are a feature of much of the material in this category.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important that the Senate understand what we are talking about and understand also that the material is not innocuous. My view is that it is the themes, as much as the explicit depictions, that are of concern. It is the themes that tend to engender a callous and manipulative orientation towards other human beings. That is one of the major problems. It is those themes that are included in much of the R material. A lot of the R material is exactly the same in content, intent, theme and title as the X equivalent. That is a matter that the Senate also needs to be aware of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>. I went to the theatre and saw that film.

I admit that you have to have a balance between the rights of persons to freedom of expression and the rights of others in the community. Normally speaking I would go down heavily on the side of the rights to freedom of expression, but this material acts the same way as racial vilification does. It vilifies a whole section of the community and portrays that section of the community as highly promiscuous and available. That is the message that comes across. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>, yes, I did see it. I viewed the film with part of my mind on the guidelines and the other part on the film itself, and I tried to work out how this film could possibly fit within the current R guidelines. I came to the conclusion that it could not. The description of the material is, I think, in our report; certainly, it is in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, so I will not describe it now.

However, they are really digressions. That is not what I wanted to talk about.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. What guidelines are there for making these grants?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. This grant was used by a Linda Dement to create a computer display called Artists Thinking about Art and Australia. According to the Courier Mail (17th November) it depicted graphic descriptions of a woman cutting off a child's penis and rubbing it over the child's body while he cried out in pain and then described in detail how the woman sexually abused the child. A 7 year old boy was able to print out several pages of the text at the display.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am concerned that a work as described would be included in an exhibition and have written to the Chair of the Visions of Australia Committee seeking a full investigation of the grant.</PARA>
<PARA>The Visions of Australia committee gave $25,000 to a group so that it could come up with a computer display which depicted violent child sexual abuse as part of a public exhibition, which a seven-year-old child was able to not only access but also print out. Every family in Australia would share the minister's concern, I am sure, at such a gross misuse of taxpayers' money. Not only should the whole process of grant assessment be investigated as promised by the minister, but the minister should also investigate in great detail all the activities of the group responsible, the Australian Network for Art and Technology. The group's director, Mr David Halloran, was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> last November as saying that he was not worried that children would see the display. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's quite an intellectual piece of work. It's not really intended for children.</PARA>
<PARA>That may be the case but, nevertheless, it was able to be accessed by a seven-year-old child. I defy any parent in Australia to see the art and accept the justification of a $25,000 government grant in the display provided by this group. The display was named `Artists thinking about science' and the grant made on 18 August 1994 was to assist in touring the exhibition to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. The group, as we see from the minister's answer today, has been receiving public funding from the Australia Council since 1986-87. Since 1991, it has itself administered an art research and development fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the committee stage I will ask the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) to provide details of all the public funding obtained by the Australian Network for Art and Technology and the qualifications, expertise and background of the principals of the group to be permitted to not only receive money themselves but also, in another position, give it out to others.

<PARA>Surely the minister does not believe that this sort of computer display is a national treasure. I will call on Senator Faulkner to advise the national parliament when Mr Lee wrote to the vision of Australia committee seeking a full investigation of the grant and when he expects a reply and  whether the Australian Network for Art and Technology still owes its existence to the generosity of the Australian taxpayer. I will also ask the minister in the committee stage to justify taking three months to answer my simple, straightforward question regarding the grant. I reiterate: if a government department is a party, unwitting or otherwise, to the display of pornographic material, how can we expect this bill to solve the problem?</PARA>

The Lord Chief Justice Cockburn in hearing an appeal from the decision in 1868 said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, may I at the outset thank you for occupying the chair at such short notice. I was supposed to be there, but I wish to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994. I want to bring to the notice of the Senate an official government publication that is not covered by the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where do we go when we get an X-rated, pornographic government publication that is put out by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) which advocates deviant sexual practices and is not, as she says in the preamble to it, a non-judgmental resource. This so-called safe sex guide is an official government publication, endorsed by the government, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the health minister. It is X-rated and pornographic, and any right-minded person&mdash;even Mr Dickie, as I know&mdash;would classify it as unsuitable for publication, but it is on the bookstands of this country and can be bought by any 13-year-old child. As the Minister for Family Service (Senator Crowley), who represents the Minister for Human Services and Health, said in debate, it is read by 13-year-olds, although it is aimed at those aged 18 years and above. There are nearly five million females aged 13 years and over in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken out about this. It is interesting that, since I have spoken about it and my telephone number was published in Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>, I received 2,500 telephone calls on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday asking me to submit petitions. I have on record the names and addresses of people who want to speak out because they are so enraged at this attack on the morals, as well as the health aspects, of this publication. This is an official government publication. It is full of lies. The publication states that between 40 and 60 per cent of women in this country have anal sex. This is an official government publication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you may not be aware that for 35 years I have been a colorectal surgeon and a member of the Colorectal Society of Australia of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. My practice has been in colorectal surgery. I have treated many AIDS patients. I have treated many active homosexual patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The damage that occurs through this deviant practice is unimaginable, and we have the government advocating it as normal heterosexual behaviour. I know that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would be appalled at this interpretation, but it is a correct interpretation. If you do not believe me, I will send you a copy of that guide. I am happy to send a copy to anybody who is here and wants to see it. I am, in fact, working for the department of health and its minister, Dr Lawrence. I am spreading that publication throughout Australia so that citizens can read it for themselves and form their own opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received support. I have also written to the churches on this because it is not my place as a politician to speak about morals. That is another aspect. I am not resiling from speaking about morals. I have taken moral positions on many occasions throughout my life. But somewhere in one's life one has to draw the line in the sand&mdash;and this is it. I can tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that that Minister for Human Services and Health, who endorsed this guide, is going to feel the wrath of the Australian population on this particular aspect. I have received 2,500 calls in the three days since my number has been published. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Human Services and Health yesterday misled the House of Representatives: she said that 10 to 15 per cent of women at some stage have anal sex. I do not like talking on these topics, but when a deliberate untruth is told in another chamber I think it must be nailed. I have researched this aspect for over 12 months because I am also a member of the Parliamentary AIDS Liaison Committee. The only research that we on the Parliamentary AIDS Liaison Committee have been able to find which has been carried out in Australia is an Australian Family Planning Association questionnaire. That questionnaire was answered by 1,162 women out of a total of 7,000 women who attended the Australian Family Association clinics in 1993. It was obviously a skewed sample because it is not the average suburban housewife who goes to the Australian Family Planning Association. But, given that, 1,162 women answered this questionnaire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questionnaire was devised to ask, `Have you had anal sex with your most recent steady'&mdash;not your spouse but your most recent steady&mdash;`or with a non-steady male?' Of these 1,162 women, 66 said that they had; 70 per cent said that no condom had been used; 13 per cent said that they had used a condom; and the rest&mdash;surprise&mdash;did not know. The point I make is that that is roughly about five per cent of a skewed sample. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the only piece of Australian research that had been done, apart from that in another publication where the AIDS organisation had come out and said that 30 per cent of women had had anal sex. To get on to that piece of research, a person had to reply to an advertisement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kings Cross Whisper</EMPHASIS>. Sixty-three women replied to that advertisement, of which one-third had had four separate partners in the previous week&mdash;so they had been promiscuous in their behaviour. Another third who replied were actually `sex workers'. That was your 15 to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister came out yesterday and said it is between 10 and 15 per cent. I put out a public challenge to her to justify those figures. Also in the endorsement of this publication she said that it was done on a non-judgemental resource and that the reason the AIDS epidemic had been stemmed in Australia was because of public knowledge of practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But anyone who knows anything about the AIDS epidemic will know that the reason it has been stemmed in Australia is because AIDS did not get into the intravenous drug using community in this country, as it has in every other country in the world&mdash;but I repeat: it has not in Australia. Most commentators believe that is due to the needle exchange program. It was a very good act on the part of the government to institute that first in the world. I have examined other countries where drug use is common, and we have led the world in that needle exchange program. That is the reason for the stemming of the AIDS epidemic. It has also been stemmed through behaviour modification of homosexuals who indulge in anal sex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ninety-five per cent of AIDS in this country is due to anal sex between homosexuals&mdash;and nobody would doubt that at all. What this publication does is advocate it as a normal heterosexual activity. That in turn can do nothing but increase not only the infectious diseases but also damages to things such as the anus, the anal sphincter, the rectum and the anatomical parts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am appalled. I put the minister on notice that there is a wave of revulsion about an official government publication which is not covered by classification. I have learnt something from my friend and colleague Senator Baume: for three years he has been pursuing a subject, and I will pursue this subject. It will not go away. I have already mentioned to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I have written to the church leaders in this country. I am already getting replies of support. Three bodies shortly are going to come out publicly: the Jewish board of deputies, the Baptist church and the Lutheran church. I have also had a letter of support from the Catholic Archbishop in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party stands condemned on this&mdash;and it will know it. I have been approached by some of my Labor colleagues and friends in the government who support me in this. But the Labor Party will have to resile from this publication because there will be an enormous backlash. Do not underestimate it. It will occur. I will make it occur, if nobody else does, and in that I have powerful support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect is that the Prime Minister has come out and said that he wants another television station for family matters. This publication is the most anti-family document we will ever read. If people doubt me, they should read it. Read it, Senator Cook, and form your own opinion. It is anti-family. It destroys the basis of what we are promoting in our community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that many of my Labor colleagues support me on this. So a backlash will occur. The official government publication is not covered by this bill, and there is a defect in it.

However, I rise to speak on a different issue in relation to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994, and it relates to violence in films, on television and in computer games.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the bill does not deal with television. However, I have some concerns about equal treatment of material on television compared with material which is in videos, in films or in computer material. It is a shame that my friend on the other side of the chamber, Senator Cooney, is not here at this moment because Senator Cooney and I sat through some hearings last year in relation to the broadcasting of material on television, particularly on news and current affairs programs, and I know Senator Cooney shares my concerns about the sort of material which is broadcast on news programs and on current affairs programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give two examples of my concern. I think you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would understand what I mean when I say that there needs to be some sort of consistency. Last year&mdash;in fact, I think it was the night before a hearing of the Senate legal and constitutional committee in Sydney on this matter&mdash;I watched a program on Channel 10 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cops</EMPHASIS>. It was a quite entertaining program. I have seen it on a number of occasions. It involved people with cameras riding around in police cars in the United States filming police officers going about their work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, normally this program is quite entertaining. However, on this particular evening in question what was shown was the body of a man who was discovered murdered in New Mexico. There were some fairly detailed close-up pictures of the man's body and of his face. From recollection, the man had been killed by being beaten over the head three times with a concrete block, having a glass bottle broken over his head and then being run over whilst he was lying on the ground. His whole body, including the tyre marks and abrasions about the head, were shown. His face was also shown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a program from the United States which was broadcast here. I am concerned that that program was broadcast as it was because I do not believe that that was satisfactory viewing, even at that hour of night. But I would have been even more concerned if it had been an Australian program which was broadcast because of course there would have been a greater likelihood of family and friends being offended by the broadcast. No effort was made to block out the man's face or obscure it in any fashion whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an interesting end to that story. A week or two after that program went to air, I remember discussing it with Mr George Chapman of Channel 10. I told him that I felt that that program was a little beyond the pale and that maybe some efforts ought to be taken to ensure that that sort of program does not go to air again. I was very pleased to see that the program was removed straightaway from Channel 10's screenings. I do not know whether or not that was due to Mr Chapman's efforts. If it was, I congratulate him because it really was unsatisfactory. As I said, most of the episodes of that program were not terribly offensive but that one quite clearly was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Tuesday night ABC television showed a program in which there was some detailed examination of an assassination which occurred in Mexico some time ago in which a politician was shot at close range. It showed film footage of the assassination taking place. The ABC highlighted the gun being placed to the man's head by a person in the crowd, the gun being fired and the man's brains being blown out the other side of his head. I do not feel that is satisfactory either, particularly as the program was going to air at, I think, about 8:30 at night. That sort of depiction of violence is unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that there is not the same regulatory regime applying to television that applies to film, video and computer games. The answer is not to ease the restrictions on video, film, computer games and publications. I believe, as you do, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there needs to be greater supervision in relation to some of these areas. But we have to have consistent control over what goes on television as well. In the television arena we have split supervision. The ABC answers to the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the commercial stations answer to FACTS, the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations. It is necessary that we have one body that oversees television and that the standards that are applied are consistent to the standards that apply to videos and films, especially as a television program can have a much wider audience than many films, videos or books. So there is need for consistency there to safeguard the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the difficulty in saying, `We're going to require all television programs to go before the film and literature classification body.' The difficulty is that there are four or five channels and regional channels, they are not all showing the same thing, even within a network, and they are each showing 24 hours of programming. So it is very difficult. But it is necessary that there be some supervision and care taken by the people who select programs for screening and by the people who produce programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be extremely careful, because there is increasingly an ability for people to take a television program or a video program and convert it into a computer file. It is very easy to do that by having the right hardware on your computer. You can take a live video signal and convert it in compressed format, in short pieces. We are going to see compression of longer pieces and we are going to see that material go onto computer disk and then circulated in an uncontrolled fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When material comes on television or on video there is some opportunity for parental control. But once that material gets taken from video or television and gets placed on computer format, it is possible, especially with young children, for those computer discs to be swapped at school and to be passed from one young person to the next young person with no control. Frequently the parents may well think that the children in question are doing their homework on the computer. Instead, the children are playing games or watching material which may have originally come from video, film or television and has been transferred into computer format. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Unless we have strict control of film, video and television they will be the gateway for this unsatisfactory material to be transferred onto computer. At that point it is very difficult for parents to exercise parental control. That is my concern in relation to these matters. I hope the government will recognise that there is a very real need for careful, ongoing supervision to make sure that we can protect community standards and protect those who are not old enough to exercise discretion in these matters themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to ask a number of questions. They relate particularly to the recommendations of the Senate legislation committee which considered this legislation. I think it would be appropriate now if I asked those questions of the minister. In its report, which was tabled in 1 November 1994, in relation to this matter, the Senate made certain recommendations. The minister has the recommendations before him and can respond. I point out that they are contained on page 7 of the committee's report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended that the Attorney-General call for the classification guidelines and amendments to the national classification code and classification guidelines to be tabled in both houses as soon as practicable after their publication in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. It also recommended that the Attorney-General call for any governmental agreements in relation to the classification scheme to be tabled in both houses as soon as practicable after their signing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is important because the national classification code is one of the three key elements in this legislation. This legislation has arisen, firstly, from the consideration that was given by the Australian Law Reform Commission to censorship procedures. Secondly, it has emerged from agreements that have been reached between the relevant state ministers and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties that has been identified in respect of this matter is the impotence of the parliament, the highest representative group of the people in the nation, to have any say over the national classification code. You might say that this is a matter for the ministers of the various states. However, I inform honourable senators that I have, at times, asked certain ministers what they have been doing in respect of the classifications, standards and guidelines. The answers that I have got have led me to conclude that a number of them are too busy and preoccupied with other areas of their portfolios that they do not really know what is going on in this particular area. Much of this work is left to the public servants and the officers who meet from time to time to fix up all of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The governments of the various states and the Commonwealth government will need to be aware of the fact that the public will not tolerate that any further. The public is getting a bit concerned about it. Where do members of the public go to express their concerns? Members of the public can complain and express concerns to the particular ministers. We need to have a bit of representative democracy about this. The state and federal parliaments need to have a greater say over what might or might not be contained in the classification code. You might say that that is possibly unworkable on two counts. Firstly, you might have a situation whereby the parliament adopts particular codes which are then found to be inadequate. How will they be overturned? Of course, if they can be made they can be overturned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not without precedent because, under the Broadcasting Services Act, the parliament can reach into the codes of practice that are established for the various programs&mdash;television, radio, et cetera&mdash;and amend them. It is going to be a very difficult job because you have to get the vote of both houses of parliament. So the government, in that particular case, would have a fairly substantial say over the matter since it commands the majority in the House of Represen tatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second count on which it may be said that it is unworkable is that this is a federal approach to the problem. If the national parliament were to have its say about the national code, it would require the states to concur with that. That is not an impossible resolution. It happens all the time, does it not?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One source of advice that the government has received with respect to this, of course, is the advice from the Law Reform Commission in its report on multiculturalism and the law. In essence, what we are talking about here is blasphemy being an old common law offence concerning the Christian religion, with particular reference to the rituals and documents of the Church of England. The advice from the commission was very clearly that because of the inconsistent protection of religion, because it had narrow, inconsistent and discriminatory coverage, we should remove the offence from federal legislation because the protection given to minority religions&mdash;let us face it, we have all of them in this country&mdash;is not the same as that given to the religion protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission also did not favour extending the law of blasphemy to cover faiths other than Christianity as it considered it would be very difficult to devise a satisfactory definition of religion and would have left open-ended legislation.

Over time the common law has related to the Christian religion and, in particular, its Anglican adherents. But that is not to say that there could not be a provision adopted in statute law which deals with the matter. The minister referred to what the Law Reform Commission said and did not say.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is needed is confidence in the decisions of the various boards. Senator Cooney was talking about giving them a fair go; he said that people were criticising them. I do not think, from memory, I have personally criticised any members of the Film Censorship Board or the Film Board of Review. I have had plenty of disagreements and discussions with them, but I have not personally denigrated them, nor would I. I think they have a very onerous job, a thankless task, and I appreciate that.

That goes for the people within the department as well who also have somewhat of a thankless task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say on my own behalf and on behalf of the committee that workers in the department, the Film Censorship Board and the Film Board of Review have been very generous with their time.

They have provided whatever information was required in a timely fashion, such that it made the work of the committee upon which I serve much easier than it would otherwise be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question about my feelings: they do not deserve to be denigrated, and I repeat this wherever I go.

This is the whole point of it all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a very strong discussion and debate about the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS> being given an R classification. It must be said that it was not given an R classification by the Film Censorship Board, because the Film Censorship Board refused to classify that film and, therefore, it was not available for public exhibition. It then went to the Film Board of Review, and the Film Board of Review overturned the decision that was taken by the Film Censorship Board, and it did so in a rather strange way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At one particular stage we had Mr Williams, the Chairman of the Film Board of Review, before us. He came to give an explanation, and I understood the erudite nature of his explanation. There was some intellectual sense in it, and one could appreciate that. I am not trying to denigrate Mr Williams because he would be far more intelligent and far more of a film buff than I am&mdash;although I very much like going to films and have seen some very good ones over the last six months, and some which have been not all that crash hot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do say this: yes, this is a problem though. Here we have a situation whereby decisions like this on criteria that we are establishing do not properly reflect what the public itself would consider to be a proper application of those criteria. That is the problem. The public itself does not even have standing when it comes to appealing a decision made by the Film Censorship Board. That is another question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular case of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>, the Film Censorship Board refused it a classification. The importers&mdash;I think it was the importers, I may be wrong here; certainly persons with `an interest', and in this case a monetary interest&mdash;had standing to appeal to the Film Board of Review. That is how the film got there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point about this is that, if the Film Censorship Board, for example, had placed this film into the R category and the public itself became appalled at that, the public under the previous legislation did not even have standing to appeal that decision; and under this legislation, the public itself still does not have standing, as I understand it&mdash;and correct me if I am wrong; I would like you to answer that&mdash;to appeal a decision of the Film Censorship Board. That is of some considerable concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the arguments that might be used as to the general issue of standing in respect of administrative decisions. But what we as a committee were concerned about was this very question of how the public, the ordinary people living in suburban or rural Australia, would consider that the criteria should be applied in respect of a particular film or video. That is why we have vindicated here these propositions in 2, 5, 6 and 7. They are, I suppose, the community recommendations which we as a committee suggested ought to be part and parcel of this whole package of legislation which includes this bill in the federal sphere and other legislation in the state sphere. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: I support this recommendation and I obtained the agreement of my State and Territory colleagues to the proposal at our meeting on 3 February 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2(iv): The Committee also recommends that regulation 4A of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations should be amended to accord with the criteria for RC (Refused Classification) in the National Classification Code.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: I have already agreed, in principle, to amend regulation 4A of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations to accord with the criteria for RC (Refused Classification) in the National Classification Code as recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) in its Report on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Censorship Procedure</EMPHASIS> and in the Report of the Joint Select Committee on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Video Material</EMPHASIS>. In principle support has also been obtained from my colleague, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator the Hon. Chris Schacht.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed that steps be taken to amend the Regulations following enactment of the Bill when the final form of the refused classification criteria is confirmed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2(v): The Committee also recommends that the current Chief Censor [now Director] be the only ex officio member of the restructured Board.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2(vi): The Committee also recommends that there be new positions of Chief Censor and Deputy Chief Censor, to be appointed from the community representatives on the Board by the Attorney-General for a three year term, with one possible extension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Under the Bill, as is the case with the current Censorship Board and the Film and Literature Board of Review, all members of the Classification Board and Classification Review Board hold statutory appointments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Bill the statutory positions of Director and Deputy Director will be subject to the same appointment processes as other Board members i.e. the need to ensure that appointees are broadly representative of the Australian community and the requirement to consult about the appointments with State and Territory Ministers (clause 48 of the Bill). </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, under the Bill they will be subject to the same tenure provisions (a maximum appointment of 5 years with a total period of appointment of no more than 7 years) as other members of the Boards. This is in contrast with the potentially open-ended reappointment arrangements under the existing legislative provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the Chief Censor and Deputy Chief Censor also have a senior executive policy and managerial role in relation to the Office of Film and Literature Classification, its personnel and its work. This is in addition to their normal classification functions and responsibilities for managing the work of the Board and for community consultation. These responsibilities will continue under the structure to be established by the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It follows from this that in the selection of appointees to fill the position of Director and Deputy Director regard would be had not only to their suitability as representatives of the community in performing classification functions and as representing the public face of the Board but also to their managerial experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Government's view the structure provided in the Bill is the most desirable model. The Office of Film and Literature Classification is a small office (there are only 24 public servants employed in the Office) and it is quite appropriate and cost effective for the Chief Censor to also be the Chief Executive Officer of the Office. I note that this structure is consistent with other statutory bodies which have, in recent years, been given greater autonomy, for example, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, by way of clarification, I note that the Committee in discussing this recommendation in its October 1993 Report on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Video and Computer Games and Classification Issues</EMPHASIS> refers to `[t]he situation of the three senior career public servants of the OFLC being the senior members of the Film Censorship Board . . . ' (para 3.62).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mention that it has not been the general practice in the past to appoint public servants to the statutory positions referred to. Of the incumbents of those positions at the time of the 1993 Report only the Chief Censor was drawn from the public service. Further, the statutory appointees to the Board hold no concurrent public service positions in the OFLC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendations 2(vii): The Committee also recommends that a community committee be established, representing major interest groups such as parents, teachers, churches, academics, women, youth, aboriginal and ethnic representatives;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) that the community committee would be asked to consider:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">any decisions of the Film Censorship Board in relation to the release of a film or video with an MA or R rating about which the Board was not unanimous; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">any decision of the Review Board to vary a Board decision to refuse to release, or release a film or video with a recommended R or MA rating at a lower classification, than recommended by the Board.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) that the Attorney-General be required to make a determination on any decision of the Review Board to release a film or video at a lower classification than approved by the unanimous decision of the Board, and be required to take into account the community committee's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response: The Committee's proposal seeks, in effect, to place a `community committee' between the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board in respect of certain decisions relating to restricted material and between the Classification Review Board and the Attorney-General in respect of certain other decisions also involving restricted material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first problem with this proposal is that it is directed solely to material in the restricted classification categories whereas some of the most difficult classification decisions are in relation to the borderline of the `G' and `PG' categories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, it would be unfortunate if an additional, and potentially cumbersome and costly structure were to put in place merely to safeguard against the possibility that the classification of a contentious film may be unacceptable to some sections of the community. There is ample evidence available to indicate that the Government's intention is that both</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Boards should be representative of the community and, after extensive consultation with the States and Territories, provisions have been added to the Bill to ensure that occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of censorship matters it has often been stated that every individual has a view, and that those views may be diverse. Accordingly, it is a significant achievement that the majority of the community appears to support the classification process and to rely upon the decisions that result. (eg, in the 1992 joint ABT/OFLC research project 70% of respondents with dependant children used the classification system; in the 1994 Australian Bureau of Statistics survey commissioned by the OFLC it was found that 90% of households with children 12 years and under were involved in their children's choice of films; it was also found that adults living in families with children 12 years or under were more aware of the classification system than adults in other households.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not the Attorney-General's role to comment on particular classification decisions made by independent Boards established for this purpose. However, it is appropriate to observe in the context of this recommendation that the particular decision that concerned the Committee in its October 1993 Report on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Video and Computer Games and Classification Issues</EMPHASIS> was made not by the Censorship Board but by the Film and Literature Board of Review as then constituted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although raised in a different context, the question of greater community involvement in classification decisions has already been addressed by my Department in some detail in an earlier submission to the Committee on the Bill. Nevertheless, the issues are similar and they are repeated here in response to this particular recommendation with some supplementary comments from a Ministerial perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current legislation provides for Censorship Board decisions on the merits and, on appeal, a review on the merits by the Board of Review. Review on questions of law goes to the Federal Court or the High Court. A similar structure is found in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A primary decision on the merits with full merits review on appeal is the standard Commonwealth structure for administrative decisions. As the ALRC in its Report on Censorship Procedure noted, where it differs from other reviews of administrative decisions is that it is not a review of an administrator's decision by an independent body but the reconsideration of a decision of one independent body by another.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This difference means that the current decision making process can potentially involve up to 21 individual decision makers (15 on the Censorship Board and 6 on the Board of Review) who can, in appropriate cases, reach the decision by a majority vote. Under the Bill the potential numbers are 20 on the Classification Board and 10 on the Classification Review Board. This gives the opportunity for a very wide diversity of views to be brought to bear in the decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed community committee would probably add a least a further 10 views to the process if the range of interest groups to be satisfied is taken into account. No doubt the views of this group will be just as divergent as can be the case with the members of the two current Boards and the new Boards. The wide diversity of views that exist within the community are reflected in the results of the on-going public consultation process referred to below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite apart from the undesirability of the Attorney-General having to make classification decisions in the manner proposed in the recommendation, questions relating to whether Board decisions reflect community attitudes, as my Department has previously indicated, are best addressed by ensuring that the Boards:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) truly represents a cross section of the community; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) remain abreast of community attitudes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The representative nature of the Boards is being addressed by the new process of consultation with State and Territory Ministers and the requirement to look at the representative nature of proposed appointments, both of which are now reflected legislatively in the Bill (cl. 48 and 74). You may be assured that this aspect is treated seriously by myself and my State and Territory colleagues. This is reflected in the recent appointments that have been made to the Censorship Board and the Film and Literature Board of Review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, appointments to the current Censorship Board follow public advertisements, interviews and recommendations on the basis of merit. Of recent times there has also been a State and Territory representative on the interviewing panel. This will continue with the new Classification Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to keeping abreast of community attitudes, the ALRC's recommendation for an on-going public consultation program has already commenced. This consultation process takes the form of special screenings of classified, but as yet unreleased, films to groups of people assembled by a market research recruitment agency. An independent market research consultant supervises the completion of a questionnaire and leads a discussion aimed at comparing the issues of concern, the range of intensity of concern about those issues, the recommended age, and appropriate consumer advice with those considered by the Censorship Board when making the classification decision. The results are made available to Board members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initial Australian Bureau of Statistics survey on Films, Videos and Computer Games commissioned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) has been completed and copies have been provided to the Committee. Further surveys and research flowing from the results of that survey are planned or underway. These include another joint exercise with the OFLC and the ABA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of the above I do not consider the proposal put forward by the Committee to be justified in the current circumstances. The perceived dissatisfaction with certain classification decisions should be addressed by examining any deficiencies in the current decision making process and taking steps to rectify any problems that are found and not by seeking to impose another potentially unwieldy structure on top of the structure that already exists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee may be assured, however, that I will be closely monitoring the operation and performance of the two new Boards, in conjunction with my State and Territory colleagues.</PARA>

I would like to refer you&mdash;and this is your guide and a non-judgmental resource&mdash;to this. It is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Making Anal Sex Safe</EMPHASIS>. It is impossible to make anal sex safe because inevitably there is trauma to the anus, the skin and the anal sphincter. They are anatomical facts. It is impossible to make it safe. This has the endorsement of your minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You then questioned Senator Harradine and Senator Harradine said that he did not have it with him. You questioned the pornographic nature of it. I do not like reading things out of publications that I consider should not be on the bookstands, and these are on the bookstands.

<PARA>There is a page on that. It is full of pornography under the classifications of pornography. I will give you a little more if you want a little more. I will keep reading if you want demonstrations of pornography under this legislation. This is your publication. That is an example of what I am referring to. Let us have a little more, if you wish. I do not want to read this, but this is what is in your publication. It states:</PARA>

<PARA>Do you want more? I will give it to you. It is in your publication. I am not going to go through it. I have placed all those yellow stickers on pornographic material. You have this on the bookstands of this country, available to anybody who goes in and is prepared to pay the price. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will withdraw unreservedly. But let me say that I did not enjoy hearing Senator Herron and nor does his performance across the country show a balanced approach to this. A balanced approach in this particular area is an approach that recognises that no matter how Senator Herron or others may not want certain acts to be performed they are being performed. No matter how much he or others do not want certain acts to be talked about, they are being talked about. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that I as a parent of a teenager am concerned about sexual activity and also the awareness that kids have and the diversity of the range of their activities. The reality is that whether we want to admit it or not sexual practices go on. For instance, most people acknowledge that the degree of sexually transmitted diseases amongst young people in this country and elsewhere is at a level that we should not be tolerating. We have to get into their psyches, and that is what has driven this particular project.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is a bit rich for the minister to talk of Senator Herron like that. Senator Herron has a wealth of medical knowledge and practice which he has brought to bear on the problems of the spread of AIDS in the community. I have been on the parliamentary committee on AIDS ever since it started. It does not meet regularly at all now. The government is going its own way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were very pleased to see Senator Herron come on that committee and he brought a great deal of commonsense and understanding of the problem to the committee.

We all know that the danger is that if this practice is spread amongst the heterosexual community that creates an enormous problem. </PARA>

We do not want it to be spread amongst the heterosexual community. </PARA>

From memory, I think it lists the Attorney-General, the film producer or somebody with an interest, and a person who is aggrieved by the decision.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure Senator Harradine, once again, knows that I cannot give legal opinions as to how the law applies on a specific set of facts. The range of people he talks about as to whether they do or do not is, once again, best left for interpretation of law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The concept of a person aggrieved is a concept which is found in other legislation, including the customs regulations for an appeal against the decision not to register a film and the ADJR, and it is a subject of judicial authority as to its meaning. It is currently interpreted to cover at least a person who has an interest in the matter but that interest has to be beyond that which he or she may have as an ordinary member of the public. For example, the advice I get from the Attorney-General is that standing would go to, for instance, two priests who may have sought judicial review of the censorship board's decision to register the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hail Mary</EMPHASIS>. So an aggrieved person has to have an interest over and above any interest that he or she may have as an ordinary member of the public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of that previous case. That is why I posed my question in the terms that I did. In my view, that person, that parent, could well be aggrieved. My understanding of the ADJR decisions has been that they would exclude a parent under those circumstances. That is my reading of it. You have incorporated the letter from the Attorney-General to the minister in respect of the recommendations from the committee but that, in a way, wipes off the community involvement. One thing I would like to see at some stage is a provision which enables persons, not just persons aggrieved in the strict legal sense of that word aggrieved, to be able to appeal against a particular classification of a film.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Unless you have something like that&mdash;unless a situation where those who are able to have standing for the purpose of appeal is extended somewhat&mdash;you are going to deny the public from having a say about the matter. Parliament does not have the say that we thought it ought to have on the national classification code. The public does not have a say in the area that we recommended&mdash;and we recommended that a particular community committee be established to advise the board but that has not been included in here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So where do the public go? Where does a parent or a group of parents or, for example, a school parents and friends group, go to appeal against a particular classification? They cannot go anywhere. If they come to us, we cannot do anything about it because there is nothing in the legislation which enables the parliament to have any say about the national code much less about the application of the code by the Film Censorship Board. So where can they go? Now that the government has denied the recommendation that the committee made, that a community group be established to advise the board, where do we go? That goes to the question of standing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I am raising this matter here as a matter of great importance.

I look at films now&mdash;for example, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and I suppose I was desensitised, because I did not walk out feeling sick and I wondered afterwards why the heck I did not. The reason was that I had one half of my mind on the actual screen&mdash;the depictions and so forth&mdash;while the other half was thinking, `How could it possibly fit into the R category,' et cetera.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the petroleum duty, the bills would reduce the duty on topped crude oil by 2.977c per litre and the duty on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene by 1.977c per litre. The reductions took effect on 11 May 1994 and were originally announced in the 1994-95 budget. The reductions partially offset the 3c per litre petrol duty increase that followed the 1993-94 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On budget day 1993, the then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, announced that the duty on petroleum products would immediately increase by 3c per litre. This government never changes: it is always hell-bent on collecting more revenue from the poor consumers in society. There would be a further 1c increase in February and August 1994. The 5c per litre increase represented a massive 96 per cent increase in the duty on fuel oil. It would have had a savage effect on the Australian mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the worst affected companies would have been Nabalco, which manages a bauxite mining and alumina refining operation at Gove in the Northern Territory. Nabalco, I might point out, is Australia's largest user of fuel oil. It consumes about 45 per cent of all dutiable oil sold in Australia; that is, 1,250 tonnes a day. The 5c per litre duty increase would have cost the company $25 million per year&mdash;one of those so-called unintended consequences that we have so much come to expect from this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just mention this position with regard to Nabalco. It is a discriminatory tax, as Nabalco is the only alumina producer which is dependent on fuel oil. It has no choice; there is no alternative choice of either coal-fired electricity or gas. There have been attempts, I understand, to get a gas pipeline through, but because of either lack of resources or cost that has not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imposition of the tax is contrary to the Gove agreement&mdash;that is, that the Commonwealth will do its best to ensure that discriminatory taxes are not applied. As a result of what the company claims, this agreement being violated, a sovereign risk question is raised, an issue of special concern to the mining industry&mdash;particularly because of all the other silly things we have seen done by this government with regard to sovereign risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nabalco does not have the ability to convert to using gas or other alternative fuels, as I mentioned earlier. Of course, Nabalco finds itself in world markets. It has no option. It is a highly competitive business and does not have the ability to pass on additional costs. This is something that this government or a future government sooner or later will have to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the to-ing and fro-ing and negotiating in the budget, the government abandoned the two duty increases scheduled for 1994. As a result, the duty on fuel oil increased by a mere 54 per cent, instead of 96 per cent. In other words, it was supposed to be good for you that it was only a 54 per cent increase rather than a 96 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the increase was still a massive impost on some of our more important export industries. It wiped out the benefits of the final stage of the shipping industry reform package. That was another unintended consequence. The industry and maritime unions had signed an agreement in August 1993 that reduced the average crewing level on Australian ships from 20.5 to 18. The agreement saved $270,000 per ship. The effect of the decision to increase the fuel oil duty by 3c was to add an extra two phantom crew members to each ship&mdash;a constant ghostly reminder of the government's failure to consider properly the effects of its policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Savage River Mines, which my colleague Senator Watson would be well aware of, in Tasmania is another example. With a very marginal profit&mdash;in fact, I think it runs at a loss&mdash;it operates an open-cut iron ore mine in north-west Tasmania. It uses about 18 million litres of fuel oil a year to bake iron ore into pellets&mdash;a bit of value adding, I might say, in the iron ore industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 3c per litre increase costs this struggling company an extra $550,000&mdash;$550,000 it cannot afford and cannot recover because it cannot increase its prices. Prices are determined on the world markets. The government clearly forgot that Australian commodity exporters cannot influence the prices they receive. They cannot pass tax rises on to their customers. Instead, cost increases directly affect their profitability and their ability to continue their operations, which is a real problem for Savage River Mines. The coalition welcomes the decision to reduce the duty on these petroleum products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As regards aviation gasoline and kerosene, the bill will increase the air safety regulation duties on avgas and avtur by 1.194c per litre. It would also enact a 7.521c per litre decrease in the component of the avgas excise that is associated with the Civil Aviation Authority's airways services. The duty on avgas would therefore decrease 6.327c per litre in all&mdash;that is, a net decrease. Avgas, or aviation gasoline, is the fuel used in piston-driven propeller aircraft. Avtur is used in jet aeroplanes and turbine-powered propeller aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The air safety regulation duty originated in the government's aviation safety cost recovery program, which progressed&mdash;fitfully, I might say&mdash;through the 1980s. The government announced in the 1992-93 budget that the cost of setting and enforcing safety standards would be shared between the industry and the government, with the government meeting 50 per cent of the cost up to a limit of $22.8 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 the government increased the duty on avgas by 0.264c per litre and introduced a similar duty on avtur as an interim cost recovery measure. This bill is the next step in the cost recovery program. The 7.521c per litre decrease in avgas is due to a reduction in the cost of providing services such as air traffic control and flight information. Over the last few years the Civil Aviation Authority has substantially reduced its expenditure on delivering those services. The reduction in duty on avgas passes some of these savings on to the general aviation sector, which largely uses avgas-powered aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) contains a number of other amendments. This bill will enact one further alteration to the duty on petroleum products. In 1993 the government legislated to prevent producers and consumers avoiding excise by substituting stabilised crude oil for diesel and condensate for petrol. The legislation inadvertently imposed excise duty on stabilised crude oil and condensate used as a fuel in the recovery, production, transportation and refining of those products. This bill eliminates that anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 will enact a number of other minor modifications to the customs tariff. Most importantly, it will implement the continued phasing out of developing country preferences. In February 1993 the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the government would modify the tariff preference arrangements applying to 42 of the more advanced developing countries. The government accordingly phased out the preferential tariffs applying to a number of products imported from those countries. In Working Nation, the government announced it intended to extend the phase-out even further. Accordingly, the bill proposes to extend it to cover all of those countries' exports to Australia, except cheese, unmanufactured tobacco, sugar and replacement components for passenger motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eighty-seven countries will still be subject to preferential tariff arrangements. They include some of the poorest countries on earth&mdash;such as Chad, with a per capita gross national product of $200 per year, and Burkina Faso, with a per capita GNP of $300 per year. The coalition does not oppose these bills.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think that a better train service from places such as Sydney and perhaps even Melbourne&mdash;but especially Sydney&mdash;might mean that more parliamentarians would use a train option rather than an airline option. I think a lot of people would do that. That might create fewer problems for the government in relation to airport noise. I see no real reason for making aviation fuel cheaper. Air travel is not an efficient form of transport in most cases. The greenhouse response strategy, which requires some reflection of damage to be included in price, should at least dictate that air transport does not get any extra advantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, I understand that the reduction of fuel oil tax which we support in relation to shipping will also be applicable to mining generators, something that also seems counter to energy use and environmental considerations. This is another example of the lack of integration of the supposed objectives of government and one of the reasons greenhouse strategies have little credibility. It seems that whenever there is conflict, the environment and environment policy loses. </PARA>

So we will not formally oppose the bills but will note that this bill is spoiled by not considering energy use in a bill that will affect it. If I thought an amendment on this bill would have any chance of support, we would have put one to target the benefits to shipping and to exclude air travel and mining. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on behalf of the opposition and its veterans' affairs spokesman, Mr Wilson Tuckey, on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). I am pleased to be able to speak on the bill because the provision of services for our veterans and their families has always been an area of great concern to me' going back to the years I spent as the opposition spokesman on veterans' affairs. It is especially appropriate this year, marking 50 years since the end of the Second World War with the Australia Remembers commemoration, although part of this bill deals with matters going back to the end of the First World War. It also deals with more contemporary issues such as service in Cambodia under the auspices of the UN peacekeeping efforts over the last few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill amply demonstrates the range of issues we have to consider when legislating on matters affecting the veteran community. It is a reflection of the length of time over which Australian service people have been putting their own lives on the line for this country. It is a reminder of the duty we have to ensure that those people who gave so much for their country are suitably catered for in the period following their active service. The provision of care and services through departments such as Veterans' Affairs is the very least we can do to repay our debt of gratitude to our fellow countrymen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn my attention first to the Anzac hostel. Under this bill, the legal and beneficial ownership of a property is vested in the Repatriation Commission. The hostel, located in Brighton in Melbourne, has an interesting history. It was established in 1918 through a gift of #25,000 from the Baillieu family to the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Fund. The purpose of the gift was to provide a hostel for totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen from the First World War, which was a terrible conflict in terms of the numbers of casualties suffered by our country and by others. It is always a moment for reflection on Anzac Day when the surviving veterans, fewer each year, take their place in Anzac Day marches around the country. The Brighton hostel was one of many Anzac hostels spread across the different states. I understand it is now the only remaining one. It has been described as a showpiece of Anzac hostels. So it is an important part of our heritage, not only for its physical qualities but also as a reminder of the Australian soldiers who have been housed and cared for there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment in this bill gives the legal and beneficial ownership of the property to the Repatriation Commission. It removes the trust covering use of the hostel which has restricted the options available to the Repatriation Commission for the provision of aged care facilities for veterans. It gives the commission more room to move over whether to retain or sell the hostel and, if the hostel is sold, how the proceeds of the sale can be applied. The original trust specified the way in which the sale proceeds must be disbursed in accordance with the original intentions of the donors back in 1918. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will allow the commission to sell the hostel and do as it deems best with the proceeds. I understand that the intention of the Repatriation Commission is to seek the preservation of the heritage value of the building and to allow the continued use of the site for the provision of care for ex-service men and women. The opposition has no problem with that. Obviously, circumstances have changed since the original gift was made and the donors could not have foreseen the needs of ex-service people further down the track. Indeed, the notion of a second world war two decades later would have been a complete surprise. After all, the war that these First World War soldiers fought was described as `the war to end all wars'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intended that the Repatriation Commission will consult with ex-service organisations and health groups for the continued use of the Anzac hostel as a care facility. Again, the opposition has no problem with that. The Repatriation Commission must have the ability to manage the hostel in the best way possible and, if this amendment gives the commission that ability, well and good. However, I would add a note of caution. Whatever course of action the commission decides to follow, it must keep the best interests of veterans in mind. This amendment gives the commission the ability to exercise its own judgment on the future of the hostel, and it must do so wisely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes a number of other amendments to the 1986 act. They include obligations on recipients to provide information or to request the person to appear before a DVA officer. This information can be requested under existing law, but it only provides for criminal penalties if there is a failure to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new clause, which will duplicate the existing clause, replaces the previous criminal penalties with an authority to cancel or suspend pensions for failure to comply with an order to supply information. That is a welcome change. It is highly inappropriate for a department such as Veterans' Affairs, given the nature of its constituency, to have the power to resort to criminal sanctions to get information from benefit recipients. Dealing with any government department can be an intimidating experience for those of us unaccustomed to the workings of bureaucracy, and the old and frail are particularly vulnerable. The threat of a criminal penalty only worsens the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are amendments also which maintain the `voluntary quotation' status of the tax file number scheme. The amendments change the way in which the provisions affect a person who does not have a tax file number. If a person who applies for a service pension or allowance&mdash;which are dependent upon an income test&mdash;does not have a tax file number, the secretary to the department will, in future, have the power to request that person to apply to the Commissioner of Taxation to get one. The secretary may not compel the production of a tax file number. However, the reality is that a person who fails to comply with such a request will have their pension or benefits cancelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also an amendment which will align the Department of Veterans' Affairs with what happens in Social Security in terms of the use of documents as evidence. The amendments will provide that a signed official departmental document is prima facie evidence of the facts and will allow the Repatriation Commission to prepare a statement of the total benefits paid to a person for any given period. That replaces the previous time consuming process which required that any statement concerning the amount of pension, benefit or allowance paid to a person must contain an itemised list of the payments made each fortnight before it can be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to spend some time now addressing one amendment which has caused some concern. This is the amendment which sets out the final date for Cambodia as an operational area. It is an important issue, because it is the category of operational area which affects the level of entitlements to which any member of the ADF who went to Cambodia might be entitled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An operational area is a warlike situation. This bill sets the cessation date for Cambodian service as an operational area, or warlike situation, as 7 October 1993. That date is the official date of the UN cease-fire, but, as anyone who has paid even the slightest attention to the Cambodian situation over the last 12 months would be well aware, that does not mean peace has finally broken out in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the dangers to Australians in Cambodia, both service personnel and civilians, are in many ways as great as ever. The Khmer Rouge, in particular, has continued its campaign against the Cambodian government and foreigners in the country. There have been a couple of tragic cases involving Australians in Cambodia. We all know of Kelly Wilkinson and David Wilson who were kidnapped and killed along with other foreigners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Khmer Rouge was making ransom demands to help it continue fighting the Cambodian government, and has issued chilling threats against foreign military personnel providing non-lethal military assistance to the Cambodian armed forces.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have been threatened, and only a few days ago the Khmer Rouge was telling US military advisers to get out of the country or face retribution. The warning was to the effect that, `If America does not abide by this warning, the Cambodian people will crush your heads. This is a right of self-defence of Cambodian people.' So the message went, as monitored on Khmer Rouge radio. It was almost identical to the threat issued earlier against Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These were issues that I raised late last year, when I called on the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to spell out clearly the government's strategy for dealing with Cambodia. That followed comments by the Thai military chief that the provision of non-lethal aid to Cambodia would increase the risk of escalating the fighting between Khmer Rouge and government forces. These matters are highly relevant to the bill under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it stands, any Australian personnel serving in Cambodia now or in the future are deemed to be in a `hazardous' area rather than an `operational' or warlike area. I would suggest, on the basis of the nature of the threats made against Australians and the obvious willingness of Khmer Rouge members to carry them out, even against innocent and unarmed civilians like Kelly Wilkinson and David Wilson, that Cambodia is more than just a hazardous situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is something we will have to monitor very closely, especially given the fluid state of affairs and the sudden changes that can occur in that part of the world. I remind the Senate of the masses and masses of landmines that are still spread indiscriminately around that country, by which any of our servicemen as well as civilian visitors could be injured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that this amendment ensures that service personnel who do go to Cambodia are entitled to the kind of assistance which reflects the dangerousness of the situation in which they serve. We should not let the overly confident judgments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, obscure the reality of the military situation in Cambodia and, as a result, diminish the entitlements to which service people would be eligible further down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports this bill, which is mostly composed of housekeeping measures which we hope will result in better outcomes for our veteran community. I close, however, with a warning to the government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of its difficulties is that the ADB's geographic boundaries are expanding all the time. For example, membership stretches from tiny Pacific states such as the Marshall Islands, to Micronesia and Indonesia; also to China, India, Afghanistan and Mongolia, to name a select few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have always been tensions in the bank. Its current philosophy is tending to promote development that not only alleviates poverty but also lays the groundwork for market forces to operate within Asian regions. The bank is now developing much more of a social consciousness than it did in the past. It is true to say that there is less agreement today on whether the bank should remain as a big spender in physical terms, or whether the issues of health, environmental resources and human resources will take a more prominent role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of the Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill 1994 which is before us is that this bill sends a clear and positive message to the rest of the world, and particularly to the region, that Australia is shouldering its share of responsibilities for lifting the living standards of the people of Asia and of the Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we must acknowledge that the bank's contribution, in the overall terms of meeting the demand, is a very small one. The fact that Australia does hold 102,370 shares in the Asian Development Bank is important. Although the holding represents only six per cent of the total subscribed capital, it is nevertheless the fourth largest regional shareholder of the Asian Development Bank and it is an important part of Australia's multilateral development program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is not a very long one, merely a couple of pages. However, within those pages, it allows the Treasurer&mdash;who, incidentally, is a member of the Board of Governors&mdash;to make the necessary agreement with the Asian Development Bank for Australia to purchase its further entitlement of 2,047 additional paid-up shares and 100,323 additional callable shares of its capital stock in the market. This purchase will enable the bank to develop programs and to assist in improving the standard of living in many countries of the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I wish to name a few of the bank's achievements since 1966. It has had 173 irrigation and rural development projects; 89 fisheries, livestock and forestry projects; 118 projects for industrial crops; and 169 power projects. It has been heavily involved in the production of gas and coal. In the social infrastructure, there have been 82 water supply and sanitation projects which have benefited something like 100 million people. There have been 71 education projects which have rehabilitated people. They are just a few of the very positive things that the bank has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To bring it more up to date, the Asian Development Bank gave a high priority to a highway project which was estimated to cost $US18.6 million, linking Bangkok via Phnom Penh to Vung Tau just north of Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. Furthermore, the bank initiated the cooperation between Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam in 1993 and coordinated meetings up to the most recent undertaking. The Asian Development Bank's goal is to use existing infrastructure and to upgrade it instead of building new roads. Other upgrade projects earmarked for early implementation include the east-west corridor project from Thailand through Laos to Vietnam, estimated to cost almost $US50 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By purchasing these shares, the benefits will not only be seen in the Asia-Pacific region but also in our country. Australia will benefit from the activities of the Asian Development Bank as major procurements from Australia by the Asian Development Bank cover goods, related services, civil works and consultancy services, which benefit Australian farmers, Australian workers and, most importantly, Australian jobs. The ability to provide a reciprocal benefit to Australia as well as to foreign aid projects is undoubtedly a move in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank is governed by a board of governors which only meets once a year. However, its day-to-day activities are actually governed by a board of 12 directors who are full time in that area. The opposition does not oppose the bill but we wish to bring to the government's attention the 102,370 shares that Australia owns in the Asian Development Bank. The amount that has already been paid is $168.8 million and the remaining $1.237 billion is subject to call. As yet, a call on the balance of those funds has not been made due to the bank's prudent financial policies and heavy levels of reserves. Some people have criticised that its lending policy has not been liberal enough given the adequacy of those reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a major player in the Asian Development Bank, Australia should take up the opportunity to increase its shareholdings at this stage. However, even though there are good reasons for being involved in the Asian Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank has been seen to be using a considerable amount of its funds on administration. Perhaps the greatest benefit that Australia could provide to this bank is to seek the assistance of some of the major Australian banks such as the National Australia Bank or a consortium of Australian banks which have world class expertise in cost minimisation programs through the use of electronic facilities. The cost of administration is a major concern to the coalition and to a number of other member contributors from the west. We believe not enough attention has been focused on getting on top of cost containment. There has been a degree of lavishness in the construction of the headquarters of the Manila bank. In fact, it was reported by the Hyundai company&mdash;the major contractor on that headquarters&mdash;that at one stage it received on average something like seven major changes to the design plans of that bank each working week which added considerably to the blow-out of the cost and also to the time that it took to construct the new headquarters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have to acknowledge that during the 1980s in some ways the Asian Development Bank really did lose its way. Its methods and its missions were frequently called into question. So the challenges of the 1990s are really going to be in mediating what I term a balance between public and private sector development and developing more of a social conscience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be fair, and a lot of its critics do not acknowledge this, the bank does have a soft lending sector. The bank, with its headquarters in Manila, is at the centre of the fastest growing region of the world, where both west and east have major strategic and economic and other interests. With this scenario, it is not surprising that amongst the various members there is a bit of a push-pull type of mentality. There is some concern in some quarters about the influence of Japan on the bank's activities, particularly with the previous head who was seen to be surrounding himself too much with Japanese advisers to the exclusion of people from the rest of the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question also has to be asked as to whether a number of the other&mdash;what I might term&mdash;economic Asian tigers that have had very high rates of growth in recent times are actually pulling their weight sufficiently in relation to the bank's activities. Some of the critics have said that because of Japan's involvement it has been a major beneficiary, perhaps more so than a number of the other contributing countries, in terms of the consequences or flow-on effects of its particular programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties that is going to be facing many of these countries that are emerging from difficulties&mdash;and I refer to Vietnam and Mongolia, and even Afghanistan, India and China&mdash;is that the reason for the success of some of the so-called Asian tigers of the past has been that the rest of the world has given these countries fairly open access for their exports. The question remains: are we tending to move to blocs which may tend to restrict access to the goods of some of these newly emerging countries that really do need to export to raise the standard of living of their people? The challenge will really be whether the rest of the world will provide the degree of open access that in the past enabled the success of countries like Taiwan, Korea and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the criticism of the bank has surrounded its lending policies. For many years there was a difficulty in terms of China, India and Vietnam. It does not seem to be any coincidence that the opening up of lending by the bank to those particular countries coincided with or followed very closely behind Japan's policy of lending directly to those particular countries. That initially met some resistance from countries such as the United States of America, but fortunately that has tended to pass in more recent times. Some of the bank's Western donors, particularly the United States, have questioned the value of some of its loans. As I have said, they seemed to benefit principally the Japanese contractors more than the borrowers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further criticism is that the bank is not nearly tough enough in linking loans policy to policy reforms. If one compares the Asian Development Bank with the World Bank, then clearly the Asian Development Bank falls well behind in this regard. It is a sensitive point, but on the other hand we have got to acknowledge that the Asian Development Bank does not have the financial or political clout of some of the bigger lenders like the IMF or the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further doubts surround the quality of the project management ability of the Asian Development Bank, in terms of its ability to properly evaluate the project loans it makes and to oversee the project management. In recent times, of the 54 projects which the bank's in-house team evaluated in one particular year, only 18 were deemed to be a success. I mentioned earlier the mismanagement of the construction of its own headquarters a number of years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been argument about the bank's lending policies and whether it should really be attaching conditions to loans, particularly to countries such as China and India. Some of the shareholders of the bank have believed that the bank should have stipulations that the lending should be directed more towards social problems, and that has not always been well received by some of the recipient countries such as India and, in particular, China. But there are other associated problems, because the Chinese wanted access to soft loans which were available from the Asian development fund, which is controlled by the bank. Such a request is also complicated by the fact that when China gets soft loans, India wants the same access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not an easy area for management, because it is continually beset by problems. There are some notorious failures, and I think it would be remiss of us not to draw attention to those, too. For example, in Nepal there was a paper mill in an area where there was no pulp available. The success rate of projects is perhaps not increasing. In fact, according to a number of observers it might even be going in the other direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned the scope of the problem in terms of geographical dimension, but increasingly the bank is venturing into more difficult terrain. Mention has been made of Cambodia or Kurdistan and it is certainly harder to work there than, for example, in relatively developed places like Indonesia and Thailand. But at the same time, the private sector capital flows are increasingly into infrastructure, so the bank's philosophies are tending to change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps, given the limited amount of time available, I should indicate that the bank is supposed to be about developing and about alleviating and overcoming poverty. The question is frequently asked in Australia: is the Asian Development Bank a worthwhile recipient of part of our aid budget? I think we have got to be somewhat careful because currently circulating within the parliament is a letter directed to the IMF and other institutional lenders requesting a greater priority on social issues. We have got to approach such letters with some degree of caution, because while this might be desirable we must not jeopardise the economic wellbeing of such banks. In many areas the bank has been regarded as a soft touch. When we look at their record of bad debts or slow payments, the question of bringing those to account is a further worry. Despite economic factors there is undoubtedly a need for proper projects directed to health, education, environment and enhancing the role of women as part of a development bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social needs are great but the problem that I am raising is that it is often very hard to make such lending profitable. Whether we should be developing other arms or other institutions to fulfil grand social objectives does need to be asked. What I am saying is this: let us not have an uncritical approach to this lending, particularly at a time of economic stringency in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I briefly give the Greens' position on the Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill 1994, I wish to mention a couple of points that Senator Watson has brought up. He mentioned that we have got to be concerned, if we look at the social values that we apply to our support or otherwise of the Asian Development Bank, not to jeopardise the economic viability of the region. I really do not think there is any evidence at all, from looking at projects which are regionally based or community based, or from looking at the benefits to women in the community, that those kinds of projects are less viable or are going to bring fewer economic benefits to the region than projects which are largely imposed from on high. In fact, there is quite clear evidence that the ability of people to pay back loans is much greater when the proposals are community based than when they are imposed from on high in sometimes unaffordable projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I recognise that the Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill is non-controversial in this place, because it has the support of at least both major parties, I would like it to be noted on record that the Greens (WA) oppose this bill. The reason we oppose this is that the Asian Development Bank, the ADB, operates on the pretext of being foreign development aid. It is included in the foreign aid budget as `multilateral aid'. Yet it is one of the fairly suspect aid agencies that appear to be imposing social and economic policies on other nations in the interest of supposedly improving their economic environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am horrified by Senator Watson's comments that the Asian Development Bank is a soft touch, is not tough enough and is falling behind the IMF and the World Bank in enforcing such things as structural development. There is a huge amount of growing criticism of the IMF and the World Bank and, if the Asian Development Bank were to get any worse in that direction, I would be even more horrified that Australian money was being used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these structural adjustment programs do not work for the people of a nation, but, instead, work to make them poorer, reduce access to education and health, and often open them to international exploitation. If senators do not think that is true, ask some of the people in New Guinea who have had their so-called free education increased 400 per cent and are now required to pay 400 kina. This is a requirement of an international aid agency such as the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this respect, the Asian Development Bank is very similar to, and works in conjunction with, the World Bank and the IMF. It is not foreign aid. The fact that Australian interests in the ADB are represented by Treasury rather than Foreign Affairs and Trade or the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Islander Affairs (Mr Bilney) is indicative of the real agenda of this organisation. We suspect it also means that Australia, through the Treasury, is pushing for just the sort of structural adjustment regimes that are creating the mounting criticisms of these organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Asian Development Bank is also strongly involved in several specific projects to which we object. Among the worst is support for major dams, such as the Thuen Hinban Dam, to be built in Laos across the Mekong, the Sekong and their tributaries. Most people who have studied even casually the record of international development will have some understanding of why we are questioning these projects. The record on dam projects has generally been atrocious. Often projects are poorly conceived, having huge technical problems within years. It is no wonder money cannot always be paid back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dams often have huge biological impacts, not only in terms of general ecological considerations but also through things like the spread of schistosomiasis to human populations and other unforeseen health impacts. Then there are the well-documented impacts on communities, on occasions relocated at gunpoint to shanty towns, if they are lucky, or simply abandoned to make their way as landless poor to the slums around big cities. While awareness of these problems has raised them to international prominence, it has not stopped international development banks from supporting them directly and indirectly, with devastating consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Laos over a dozen large dams are proposed for the Mekong-Sekong area. Virtually all of them are to provide power for Thailand. The Mekong-Sekong river system is, to freshwater biologists, what the Amazon is for terrestrial biologists. For example, while there are only 27 freshwater fish species in Australia, the Mekong River Basin is estimated to have over 1,000 species. It is an incredibly diverse aquatic and jungle ecology. The rainforest there is a largely pristine habitat for the largest populations of wildlife in Indochina, including tigers, leopards, elephants, guar, bantang, Asiatic black bears, gibbons, and other rare mammal species, as well as tens or hundreds of thousands of plants, insect, bird and reptile species, many of which are rare or endangered. Yet the plan is to fill the area with dams, with 12 on the Sekong alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Thuen Hinban Dam has been identified as having a serious impact on important wildlife habitat immediately upstream. The Nam Kading forest, in the most important of 17 identified forest reserves, is immediately downstream. I understand that the Asian Development Bank has already given a $60 million subloan to this project. While the Asian Development Bank is not always directly contributing to all of the dams, neither has it considered the total impact of so many dam projects in such a small area. These include the Nam Cham project and the already heavily criticised Nam Theun 2 Dam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is the power from the dams mainly going to Thailand rather than Laos, but so are the trees. An entire industrial estate is being built in Thailand to process the logs from the operation. Coincidentally, this is just across the wonderful new bridge we built, and, also coincidentally, many of the dams are being built by Australian companies such as John Holland, Transfield, and HEC Enterprises, the company that was to have built the Franklin Dam in Tasmania. Of course, Thailand needs the trees now that it is not so easy to get access to Cambodian forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Asian Development Bank is also involved with support of various sorts for the Salween Dam in Burma, again to supply Thailand with power; and the Martaban Gas pipeline between Thailand and Burma. It thus continues to assist Thai de facto support for SLORC. The deal is basically that Thailand gets Burmese teak, gas and power, while SLORC gets much needed capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our opinion, the Asian Development Bank is neither a socially nor an environmentally responsible organisation.

Australia played a very important role in the development of the bank, and it is one of the major shareholders. The bank has always been one of those world regional banks with which we have had, as a country, the closest association. The bank has grown over time and it now has 55 member countries, of which 37 are members from the region. Of its members, 33 were classified as developing countries in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support very much the remarks of my colleague Senator Watson in the debate today in saying that the ADB has had a bit of a mixed track record. There have been some projects that have not gone as well as we would have liked. There has been disputation, from time to time, over the prioritisation of its funds, the determination of the projects with which it should be associated, and which of those projects it should fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that, in the comments made by Senator Margetts, she was placing a little too much reliance on just one aspect of the bank's project work; in particular, she paid attention to the development of dams. The ADB is, of course, a much more broadly based bank in terms of its activities than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the ADB has been a success, but there is room for improvement. It can be fairly criticised&mdash;as Senator Watson did&mdash;in terms of top heaviness in some of its administrative structures, and there is certainly scope for improvement. Australia has a very important role in the bank. We are an important player in the region, and we have a very positive opportunity to play an increasing part there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank is, of course, in that sense, a major institution in Australia's multilateral development program. We hold six per cent of the bank's capital, which is valued at $US1.4 billion. Of that amount, $US168.8 million has been paid to the bank and the remainder is subject to call.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1994, the ADB Board of Governors approved the resolution to double the general capital of the bank to $US48.8 billion. That is what this bill is about. Under that arrangement Australia will be entitled to another 102,370 shares. Only two per cent of those will be paid up. The remainder are callable, in line with our pre-existing situation. Australia has supported the increased ADB capital proposal. We on the coalition side support that expansion in the capital of the bank.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the comments made by senators in the debate. In 1989 I was a member of the subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade looking at Australia's overseas aid program. We took extensive evidence from Australians who previously worked at the Asian Development Bank, and to say that we received a sorry tale of maladministration would be an understatement. I think our report reflected that at the time when it was tabled. As a member of that subcommittee I was one of those people who expressed strong comments and criticism similar to what other senators have expressed here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that in those days the bank was top-heavy in administration, and though there has been considerable improvement I think it still is. The issue of salaries, conditions and perks paid to the permanent staff is somewhat obscene compared with the issues they are trying to address in helping the very poorest in developing countries get a better deal in the world. I want to point out to senators that the government is aware of this criticism. Recently Australia voted against salary increases for the staff and executive directors of the ADB and the World Bank, and abstained from a recent ADB vote on the administrative budget to demonstrate our displeasure at the salary decisions previously approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appointment as our representative at the Asian Development Bank of Peter McCawley, the former deputy head of AIDAB&mdash;a man with a development background&mdash;was a very welcome move indeed. Again, one of the criticisms of our 1988 report was that we had always been appointing people from Treasury. Commendable and as experienced as they were in Treasury matters and matters of international finance, their experience in development matters was much more limited. I support strongly the view of the committee that the ADB is a development organisation and not a banking institution, and our representatives should reflect those skills on the development side. As I understand it, Peter McCawley was the first non-Treasury officer to be appointed as our permanent representative for a term of office, and as such I think his appointment was welcome indeed. As one who knows Peter personally, I suspect he would have taken some pleasure in voting against the salary increases and the perks that go with it at the Asian Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that from 1989 to 1993 Australian procurement from the ADB exceeded the contribution by Australia to the ADB by $170 million. One of the criticisms that we had in the late 1980s was that Australian organisations were not getting a proportionate share of the contracts compared with our contribution. Most people believe the ratio should basically be one to one. I think we have seen a big improvement since then. Australian organisations are now getting a higher proportion, not because we are rigging the process but because we have actually got the skills in our organisations&mdash;the business community, aid agencies and so on&mdash;to know how to put forward the best proposals to meet the changing needs for aid in the developing world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always&mdash;and I think others have too&mdash;had a view that the organisations of the Asian Development Bank can be easily criticised. I have made it clear that the government has accepted that. It is reflected by some of the things we have done recently. However, the Asian Development Bank is a multilateral aid agency where governments are represented. It is the best we have got going in the region in conjunction with the World Bank and it is therefore supported. We have always taken up every demand on a call since 1966 and that means we are now the sixth biggest shareholder. We have always accepted that responsibility. Though, at times, there have been criticisms that the money could have been better spent elsewhere in the aid budget, we have stuck with the Asian Development Bank. We have called consistently for reform and improvement and will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We note that the Asian Development Bank is slowly moving, probably not as fast as some of us would like, towards programs of social benefit for communities. That is very necessary. I have always felt that the bank should get closer to programs such as the success, for example, of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. It is a bank that is aimed at providing small loans to very poor women in villages in particular. It gives them access to very small amounts of money, maybe no more than $200 or $300, to start a small business. The bank has had an extraordinary success rate at that sort of level of contribution. I think the repayment rate has been over 90 per cent. It has empowered women in the very poorest of circumstances to break through the poverty barrier. Those are the sorts of programs I think the Asian Development Bank has got to support. It must provide the funds for such national institutions as the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. </PARA>

On behalf of the government, I can assure the senators present that we will continue to keep the pressure up on the performance of this bank, particularly on its management terms, its conditions, the salaries that are paid to its staff and also the evaluation of its projects to make sure there is proper transparency.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer the minister to yesterday's appalling current account deficit of $2.3 billion and to many market economists' prediction that Australia is heading towards a current account deficit a further $2 billion higher at $28 billion than the government's already $8 billion higher revised forecast of $26 billion or six per cent of GDP. In light of the higher revisions to earlier months deficits and the new market forecast, does the minister support the need for the government to review its recent forecast? Does the minister concur with the sentiments of the chief economist of Schroders, Mr Brett Allender, that `If we're not worried about that'&mdash;that is, a 6 per cent of GDP deficit in the balance of payments&mdash;`I'm sure international investors will start worrying about it as the year goes on'? What action does the government propose to take to correct this appalling situation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that the net income deficit component of the current account is expected to rise in line with increases in world interest rates and increased profitability of foreign firms that are operating in Australia. The balance of payments figures released yesterday, including the upward revisions to the net income deficit component, are consistent with the government's revised forecasts that were released by the Treasurer on 31 January 1995. That much was said yesterday by Treasurer Willis and I am certainly comfortable in confirming that today. The improving international economic outlook&mdash;there is no question that it is improving&mdash;is expected to increase demand for our exports which, combined with higher commodity prices and, of course, the breaking of the drought, will help offset the impact of a rising net income deficit on the current account deficit in the year ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>

For the second day in a row the Leader of the Government in the Senate has shown not one clue as to the underlying problems facing us as a result of this balance of payments crisis. In pointing out that the government has made much of its policy measures to improve our external prospects, is the minister aware of the fact that over the past year the trend in exports has been almost flat whilst during the 1993 election campaign Prime Minister Keating said that exports were going gangbusters.

As I said, the improving international economic outlook is expected to increase the demand for our exports right across the spectrum.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. Minister, you would be aware of media reports of a survey by Fleet Systems which shows that fleet maintenance costs and fuel consumption for the latest models of Australian cars are falling. Australian models, in fact, appear to compare favourably with similar imported vehicles. Can the minister advise what the implications are for the Australian industry and this improved quality and cost competitiveness?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of the improvements in fuel economy, efficiency and price in the Australian automotive industry. It is a good reason why Australians should buy Australian when it comes to motor vehicles and any other manufactured goods or services that this country produces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These days, Australia is increasingly recognised as producing goods and services which are invariably better than foreign imports. As a nation we are competitive on cost, on the quality of the products that we produce and on the design input that we insert into those products, and we are better, too, in services and backup. While that is a trend that many Australians recognise&mdash;and increasingly that is the case; I think some 73 per cent recognise that buying Australian is buying quality&mdash;there are, nonetheless, some who still think that buying foreign is good. Of course, that is not so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A manufacturer of washing machines in Australia tells me that their product in Taiwan is regarded by the consumers in Taiwan as high quality&mdash;better than Scandinavian, better than European and better than North American products. They look for the `Australian Made' logo when they try to assess quality and make the choice. Of course, while some Australians think that buying foreign goods might be more exotic, the truth is that a lot of foreigners think buying Australian goods is best. What goes around comes around and, of course, if you buy Australian goods, you create work in Australia, you help Australian companies grow and you help secure long-term job prospects for the next generation of young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question was about the view of the car fleet industry on the fuel efficiency and quality of Australian cars. Fleet Systems is one of Australia's largest car fleet management companies. It has in its stables some 93,000 cars. Its chief executive officer, speaking about the quality of the Australian-made Ford Falcon and the Australian-made Commodore, said, `They are both'&mdash;that is, the Falcon and the Commodore&mdash;`really fantastic motor cars and I guess we could rightly claim they are world class.' He is in a position, of course, to know. You could equally say that is true of the Australian-built Toyotas and the Australian-built Mitsubishi cars. They, too, are equally fantastic motor vehicles and are of world class.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the challenge for all of us is to encourage Australian consumers to recognise the inherent qualities of the Australian product. The government does this through its support of the Australian made campaign. The campaign encourages Australian consumers to take into account the great advances in quality and competitiveness made by Australian manufacturers in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the campaign started, the government has contributed $15 million and the private sector has supported the campaign with funding of $22 million, and this includes licence fees. The campaign, according to a recent consumer survey, means that 73 per cent of customers in this country consider that locally made products are generally better quality than comparable imported products, and the 2,600 licensees who use the `Australian Made' logo employ over half a million Australians and generate $4 billion in sales annually. The research commissioned by the government indicates that an additional $185 million to $350 million per year in sales is generated as a consequence. I commend the buy Australian campaign to the Senate and to Australia.</PARA>

That will teach him to re-write the questions that are prepared by me! The second part of the question that Senator Carr has asked is very important. This Sunday will be the sixth national Clean Up Australia Day. As the federal environment minister, I take this opportunity to congratulate Ian Kiernan and the organisers of Clean Up Australia Day for the important contribution that they continue to make to changing people's attitudes to the environment. Clean Up Australia Day really does bring the community together. It encourages positive action for the environment, and it also obviously improves environmental awareness in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since its inception in 1989, Clean Up Australia Day has grown enormously. From a clean-up of Sydney Harbour which involved 40,000 people, Clean Up Australia Day 1994 was an event with half a million people participating from 700 towns and cities across Australia. In the past six years, more than two million Australians have dedicated the first Sunday in March to retrieving rubbish from the country's streets, roadsides and waterways. This is evidence that individuals can make a huge contribution towards protecting the environment, starting with their own immediate environment, their own local area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Protection of the environment is now a very important long-term issue on our nation's agenda, and I believe it is becoming a more important priority for Australians every day. There are a large number of Australians who recognise that the state of our environment directly impacts on our quality of life as well as on the quality of life of future generations. Clean Up Australia Day is one of those occasions that really does offer Australians an opportunity to demonstrate the commitment to the environment that is broadly held in the community, and hopefully many others will join in.</PARA>

I refer to a Federal Court judgment of 16 December last year which rejected the definition of `Made in Australia' in the government's origin labelling bill, which I note has disappeared without trace after being passed by the House of Representatives. Firstly, does the minister now admit that this is the third Federal Court judgment since 1988 which calls for a stronger definition of `Made in Australia' than the one in the bill? Secondly, will the minister now admit that the Minister for Consumer Affairs misled parliament in claiming that her definition of `Made in Australia' was the same as the Federal Court's?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say at the outset that it is a bit rich for Senator Lees to be raising this issue in this way. I also say that she is wrong. She is wrong about the initial statement she made that the Federal Court has rejected the definition. The Federal Court did not reject the definition. It stuck with the definition. I am saying this in the context that the Federal Court is still hearing this matter on appeal and I cannot go into the facts in great depth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no disputing that the Federal Court accepted the public understanding of the term `Made in Australia' as meaning that the product had its essential quality of character made in Australia. That comes out in Justice Davies' decision. Justice Davies went on to find that the koalas in question actually acquired their essential characteristic here, whereas the contention was that they acquired that characteristic overseas. So the definition is not rejected, and our understanding is not rejected; it is just an interpretation of the facts in respect of that legal  definition. I suppose that in this sort of area we are used to a degree of a campaign of misinformation, particularly by those on the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not often agree with Senator Vanstone, but she understands the morass to which Senator Lees and other Democrats, Senator Boswell and others in the opposition have led themselves into in this area. When one starts to play with definitions and words in this area, it becomes senseless and confusing. I share those words with Senator Vanstone. Her description of the behaviour of the Democrats and some of her colleagues is senseless and confusing. It is senseless and confusing because we are trying to stick to a term that is acknowledged and understood here and internationally as part of the world trade situation that we are operating within.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition of Senator Lees, Senator Boswell and some other mavericks on the opposition leads to nothing but confusion for consumers and the trade in question. She talks about time delays. There have been time delays in this area. Many, if not all, of those time delays have occurred because it has taken so long to get a consistent line from the other side. Changing shadow ministers and positions are reasons for this. The shifting sands of the other side cannot really give us a solid position to basically respond to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian government very warmly welcomes the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission findings on the 12 January killings in Liquica in East Timor. The full report of the commission has not yet been released, but it announced its basic findings yesterday. In short, the commission found that the six had been shot unlawfully, torture had been used and that they were unarmed civilians. It did not find conclusive evidence that the six were Fretilin supporters, as had been claimed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important recognition from inside Indonesia that the human rights situation in East Timor remains far from satisfactory. It lends support to the view that the overall situation there has deteriorated since late last year. The Liquica killings are also the subject of an investigation by a military investigative team, which has reportedly concluded that, while soldiers had violated procedures, two of those killed were Fretilin members and the other four were members of a network supporting Fretilin. A recently appointed Military Honour Council, as the terminology goes, is yet to consider the military team's findings. It is not known when it will announce its decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More generally, the human rights commission role in relation to the Liquica killings is also welcome evidence that there is now greater scope within Indonesia for public expression of alternative views on sensitive issues. It has independently found common ground with some of the concerns that the Australian government has been expressing publicly and privately about the deteriorating situation in East Timor. It may take time for more liberal attitudes to prevail. But, as I have constantly said, Indonesia is a society in transition. We should acknowledge those positive trends as well as be quick to react to the less positive ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We obviously hope that the Indonesian government will take the commission's conclusions fully into account when it considers its response to the killings, in particular the issue of whether those killed were unarmed civilians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I say again more generally that we hope these findings will encourage the Indonesian government to reconsider its whole approach in East Timor. As I said just a few days ago in Jakarta in my talks with Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas, a process of reconciliation in East Timor is more necessary now than ever. That needs to involve a massive reduction in the military presence there, as has already been promised by the Indonesian government; recognition of East Timor's distinctive cultural identity; some sensitive economic development which has regard to the distinctive character of the place; and, hopefully, some greater degree of political autonomy as well. A `security approach' will not solve the problems in East Timor. The application of that kind of approach to date has quite an unenviable track record of human rights abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The human rights situation in East Timor is currently under scrutiny at the annual session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, which does afford an opportunity to highlight the continuing international concern about the situation there. I hope it may be possible for a consensus resolution to be produced out of the UNCHR meeting. We will just have to await the course of events there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission findings are encouraging. I think they ought to be given due recognition and acknowledgment by those people who are so quick to criticise everything that happens in the country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction. I draw the minister's attention to a report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> about a joint union-employer formed company receiving a government grant to finance training programs for the construction industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Mr Free, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, and I were able to participate in a ceremony with the Australian construction industry; namely, the union&mdash;CFMEU&mdash;and the Master Builders Association of Australia. They had come together to form a joint company called Building Employment and Training Australia, or BETA, to look at ways of improving training opportunities for young people joining the construction industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objective of the joint company is to have 1,000 new traineeships by the end of 1995. As a result of its proposal, the government was able to provide by NETTFORCE $100,000 to fund the joint venture company. The government was very pleased to see this example of an industry which, despite the fact that only a few years ago it was bedevilled by confrontation and antagonism, can now have both employers and employees working together for the good of the industry itself and which, above all else, is creating employment opportunities for young people in Australia. This also reflects the general improvement in the construction industry in Australia in recent years and, in particular, the success of the reform strategy which this industry has entered into with the Australian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1991, with the formation of the Construction Industry Development Agency, known as CIDA, and the operation of the Construction Industry Development Council, we have seen many improvements in the way this industry has been organised and run. There has been major commitment to reform and, as a result, industrial disputes have been substantially reduced&mdash;in many cases to almost negligible proportions. We have seen innovation, new techniques of management, new techniques of building itself&mdash;all to make our construction industry a much more competitive industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the industry is now a successful exporter of its services and its techniques, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. That is why in the Working Nation statement of last year we funded the industry for the Asian consortium infrastructure program to a sum of $12 million to encourage Australian construction companies to form consortiums to bid for the big infrastructure programs of the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of yesterday's meeting of the Construction Industry Development Council to look at the post-CIDA arrangements which will come into effect when CIDA goes out of existence under the sunset clause legislation in June of this year, the industry agreed to form a new National Construction Industry Council made up of about 15 representatives selected from across the industry&mdash;people who will have experience, expertise and eminence in the industry&mdash;to look at how we can further progress the reform program in a voluntary and cooperative way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday was a major day in terms of the funding of BETA, the joint venture of the union and the Master Builders Association, and the creation of a new industry body, the National Construction Industry Council, and I will announce the members of that body in May of this year. This is another step forward in the improvement of what is now a major competitive industry in Australia, the construction industry, that will enable us to get a bigger share of export opportunities as well as providing real dynamic growth within Australia itself.</PARA>

Following moves by your ministerial colleague Mr Tickner to bring one of Florida's most notorious and feared inmates&mdash;three-time lifer, murderer and rapist, James Savage&mdash;back to Australia to reportedly serve in the medium security prison at Swan Hill, Victoria, I ask: what justifies the enormous expense and sheer effort of the department to bring this killer to Australia?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the two reports do reflect is that the structure of the Australian economy, and more particularly our export profile, is moving more towards the rapidly growing areas of world trade&mdash;that is, manufactures and services&mdash;and our reliance upon our traditional strengths in commodities is being reduced. It is not that we want to reduce our participation in that area, but we are trying to add this new element so that we can get closer to the areas of rapidly growing export. As our profile moves into that area we can take advantage of being, in geographic terms, in proximity to the fastest growing areas in world trade and also our economy will be participating in the fastest growing areas of economic activity. That is where the long-term solution to our serious balance of payments situation lies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of these events will turn it around overnight. But the opening up of Australia's economy to international competition in the early 1980s has had, over the succeeding period, dramatic impact upon our services sector, and services exports have been expanding at a greater rate than services imports. We have been improving our balance situation there and at a greater rate than global services exports&mdash;that is, our international market share in this areas has been improving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, for the first time in our history we had a trade surplus for services in the March quarter of 1992 and we are now still reflecting the fundamental change in the structure of our economy. We have dramatically reduced the deficit. It is down to $1.4 billion over the year 1993-94, as reflected in this report, which is down to less than half the size of the deficit of a decade earlier. More importantly, if the trends continue, and the expectation is that they will at this stage, the balance of the international services account will have shifted to surplus by 1995-96, contributing to a long-term solution to our balance of payments situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to move the goods and services element of our trade substantially into surplus because of the problem of significant net income deficit. Merely balancing our goods and services account will not be sufficient over the medium-term. That is why the emphasis is being shifted to these important areas of manufactures and services, so that when prices improve in our commodities&mdash;and, as Senator Evans indicated earlier, the expectations are that they will&mdash;we will have improving strengths in our traditional areas of economic activity but also capacity to add to them in elaborately transformed manufactures and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The improvement in services is widespread. The greatest strength comes from tourism, but there are some other significant areas to note which are important for jobs in Australia and for quality jobs in Australia&mdash;the boom in our education exports from virtually zero to $1.4 billion by 1992. The information technology and telecommunications sector, which has increased tenfold over the last decade in its exports, has set itself an ambitious target of improving fourfold again, to $10 billion by the year 2000. So this report is an important signpost along the road to restructuring the Australian economy and shows significant positive elements. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The government's continual condoning of the illegal and improper activities of the Prime Minister's piggery group while Mr Keating was a half owner seems to go on and on. I detailed the latest example in a notice of motion I gave this morning. There has not been one word of apology or admonition from the Prime Minister or his ministers about these repeated breaches of the law while the Prime Minister was a half owner of this piggery. There has not been any criticism by the Prime Minister of his former company's involvement in this latest conspiracy with a Danish multi-national. This has allowed the Prime Minister to escape the humiliation of his half owned piggery, at the time, being found guilty of polluting the upper reaches of the Scone water supply. The Prime Minister has already misled the parliament over his piggery's polluting practices which were admitted by the company during the New South Wales government's commission of inquiry into its expansion plans about 15 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it too much to ask the Prime Minister to stop his hypocrisy and come out and condemn what this piggery has repeatedly done? Otherwise, Mr Keating's professed concerns about the environment will be exposed as simply dishonest. He will not allow pollution unless he is the polluter. That is the simple consequence of what has been happening now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt about the facts of this latest example of how the Prime Minister's former company has got around the law. There are plenty of instances where his companies did not get around the law. They were hit with penalties by the Australian Securities Commission for failure to meet the reporting requirements of the ASC. The fact that there were 13 penalties involved seemed to get very little attention in the media. I find that extraordinary. I bet if someone from the Liberal Party was involved in such a matter there would be volumes of headlines about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyway, there is no doubt about the facts of this present matter to which Senator Bolkus replied with his normal line of personal abuse of me. There was no attempt to address the issues of how the Corporations Law or its administration appear to be effectively got around by those people running the Prime Minister's companies, and about which the Prime Minister apparently feels totally content. He is not prepared to dissociate himself from those activities beyond saying, `Oh, I wasn't in charge of the running of it.' He was a half owner. He has condoned by his silence the dishonest and improper behaviour of this polluting piggery. There is no doubt about the facts. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is clearly an agenda. When you read this document you see that the agenda is not only Australian but also international. The sad thing is that the federal government, by sending the Lake Pedder issue to an inquiry, has in fact countenanced, in the true sense of the word, the draining. I hope that the government will decide in the end not to, but by sending it to an inquiry and not ruling it out it has in fact given comfort to those who would drain the lake. It should have ruled it out straightaway, instead of which it has put the member for Fraser, Mr Langmore, in charge of an inquiry, which is a bit like putting a child in charge of a lolly shop on an issue like this. His views on Lake Pedder have been put on the public record prior to the hearing and I would have thought this would have given him a conflict of interest. </PARA>

In the document are letters from people such as David Suzuki. He stated that he believes Pedder 2000 is ushering in a remarkable new era where we seek to actually restore and heal systems that have been damaged by human activity. Milo Dunphy says that draining Lake Pedder is the best possible start to preventing a Welcome Reef Dam, the raising of the Warragamba Dam, the ecological disaster of the Tully Millstream project in Queensland and a dam in New Zealand.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, it seems that he has trouble in a lot of areas when it comes to lakes. It seems that these people checked local air strips, transferred personnel, organised accommodation and made arrangements to travel hundreds of kilometres, so the cost and disruption to the people living in these areas has been absolutely enormous. I find it hard to understand the disgraceful actions of this government agency which has put so many people to so much trouble and expense only to have the meeting called off at the very last minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is two years since the people in this area first tried to have consultations with the world heritage agency after this government proposed the world heritage listing of Lake Eyre prior to the election in 1993. After two years, they eventually get the world heritage agency to come to the Lake Eyre region. The people there live in a very sparsely populated area. They get to the stage where they are going to meet these people and, at the very last minute and without any prior knowledge, the agency cancels the meeting, thus causing tremendous expense to the people involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people in the area naturally wondered why, at the last minute, these consultations would not take place. The reason given was that it was considered inappropriate to visit the area at present in the light of recent violence between opposing Aboriginal groups in Marree and the lodgment of a native title claim for Lake Eyre Basin. That is the reason given as to why, after the proposed world heritage listing, the world heritage agency would not even consult with the people in the Lake Eyre catchment area. The people involved have said that, having put this much time and effort into trying to talk to people from Canberra and trying to talk to the agency, if this is the best that the agency&mdash;part of Senator Faulkner's department&mdash;can do, what is the point of their going to the expense that they have gone to to try to have the consultations over the three-day period?

I do not know what it will be next week, but I am quite sure that Senator Faulkner has reached the stage where the portfolio that he is in charge of is now in charge of him. Unless we get some sensible answers, there is not going to be any cooperation from or consultation with these people. They are so far removed from Canberra and they are having their lives disrupted by agreements and arrangements which, at the very last minute, are put aside by people who show no cause and no care for people who otherwise have no opportunity to have any influence over what is happening in their area. </PARA>

At that stage, Senator Evans assured the Senate that the government was doing all it could to assist Mr Bowra. I must say that there was a letter written by Senator Evans, which I acknowledge and appreciate, on behalf of the government, seeking to assist Mr Robert Bowra. Of course, things have changed now. The court has upheld Mr Robert Bowra's appeal. His sentence has been reduced from 12 months to six months. That decision was given on 5 February this year.

It remains totally unsatisfactory that this man, who has a wife and children in Australia and a business, all of which have suffered tremendously as a result of this, remains in prison. Three weeks might not seem long, but it is an extremely long time to be in a foreign prison without seeing those close to you and without being able to run your business, which I believe in this case has all but totally collapsed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the statement.</PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the statement incorporated into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I rise to make a statement on behalf of the Minister representing the Minister for Transport about shipping in and around our unique national treasure, the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presently ships use two routes to traverse the Reef.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is known as the inner route travels from the Torres Strait in the north, to Gladstone in the south.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The alternative route&mdash;the outer route, commences in the Prince of Wales Channel, leaves the Torres Strait at Bligh Entrance, and continues southwards through the Coral Sea to Sandy Cape, just south of Gladstone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All ships entering and leaving the inner and outer routes have to cross the Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, pilotage is compulsory in the inner route between Cairns and the Torres Strait for all oil and chemical tankers and liquid natural gas carriers regardless of size and all other ships over 70 metres in length.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most hazardous parts of the reef to navigate are in the Torres Strait, and in the northern section of the inner passage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Narrow channels, strong tides and the presence of fishing boats all enhance the risk of a grounding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore in the case of the outer route the process of skirting the reef, and the largely uncharted waters pose a similar risk of grounding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With some 87 million tonnes of international trade&mdash;mostly Australian exports&mdash;shipped through the region annually, this ever present danger is a matter of great concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Altogether there are some 2100 local and international vessel movements annually, including 1700 through the inner route, 600 of which do not call at any Queensland port inside the reef. This leaves some 400 vessels using the outer route.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst pilotage in the inner route is, as I said, mandatory for all oil and chemical tankers, liquid natural gas carriers and other ships over 70 metres in length, it is not compulsory in the international waters of the Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each year 30 loaded oil tankers enter the Torres Strait and transit the inner route, while a similar number travel north along the inner route under ballast. Twenty tankers transit the outer route southward. The Government considers that there is no compelling reason for those 30 tankers to not join the 20 tankers using the outer route southward.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Few Australians would think of the Great Barrier Reef as a shipping lane. It is seen by most as a precious natural asset&mdash;and indeed it is. That is certainly the view of the Government, and that is why we are determined to take all reasonable steps to minimise the potential for shipping disaster. But in doing so we must strike a balance between protecting the natural environment, and maintaining viable shipping lanes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Already the Government has taken a number of significant steps to safeguard the Reef and to improve safety in shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last September I announced new administrative procedures for issuing single voyage permits to foreign vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This places an obligation on shippers to undertake thorough safety checks before chartering foreign vessels. This condition came into effect this week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, shippers applying for permits involving bulk carriers and all types of tankers must now certify vital information on the condition of the ship, as well as the qualifications of its crew.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the Government's response to the House of Representative's "Ships of Shame" Report targeted inspections have doubled and now more than one in two foreign flagged vessels are subject to inspection when they call in Australian ports. This rigorous inspection regime has unquestionably deterred substandard shippers from calling in Australia. Today we can boast the toughest inspection regime in the world. One in which monthly ship detention reports are published to bring sub-standard shipping to worldwide attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of the Reef itself, by introducing a regime of compulsory pilotage for the inner route in October 1991, Australia made this transit route one of the world's few recognised compulsory pilotage areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More recently in October 1993 the Government announced a detailed review of shipping in the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait. We did so to ensure that the management of shipping operations maximises environmental protection, and minimises the risk of accidents and pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This review has been conducted in conjunction with the Queensland Government. A wide range of interested parties, including the shipping industry and environmental groups have been consulted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report is presently being finalised and will be released by the government soon.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless today on behalf of the Minister representing the Minister for Transport I announce a number of initiatives that will improve the safety of shipping in the Great Barrier Reef and the Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initiatives involve&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">minimising shipping pressure in the inner route,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">additional steps to improve the safety of ships that use the inner route,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">improving navigational safety in the Torres Strait, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">improving the safety and reliability of the outer route.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are undertaking these initiatives in the knowledge that many vessels use the Great Barrier Reef inner route because of a lack of suitable charting for the outer route through the Coral Sea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to improve the charting of the outer reef the Government can today announce that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) will provide funding for the production of these charts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This task will involve surveying that begins at Bramble Cay in the eastern approaches to the Torres Strait, and goes down the Queensland coast to the end of the reef just north of Fraser island, a total distance of some 2000 kilometres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once this charting is done, those vessels not calling at Queensland ports that currently use the inner route, will, unless there are exceptional circumstances, have absolutely no reason to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Simultaneously with this charting, AMSA will proceed with the introduction of a mandatory ship reporting regime for the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMSA will also seek to implement a reporting system with the agreement of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and will aim to have the measures in place before the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government can assure the Senate that the Queensland Government has been cooperating with the Commonwealth in moving toward the introduction of a vessel traffic system to cover both the North East Channel and the Torres Strait. The Commonwealth is very grateful for the Queensland Government's assistance with this task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Together AMSA and the Queensland Government have been looking very closely at initiatives to improve maritime safety in northern waters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extensive studies by consultants of potential high-technology solutions to the navigational problems in the region have been completed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMSA and the Queensland Government are now negotiating joint ventures to ensure these initiatives can be introduced at the earliest time and in the most cost-effective way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the first stages of this cooperative approach will be the introduction of a vessel traffic system to cover the Torres Strait, the Great North East Channel route near Cape York, and the inner route.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extended coverage of this radar traffic system will provide accurate real time information and reduce the prospect of ship collisions and groundings. This will be a vast improvement on the present situation where authorities rely on positions radioed in from vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will provide cover of, and information relating to, the important `choke' points&mdash;where channels are narrow and the hazard to shipping is greatly increased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore it will assist the Australian and Queensland agencies involved in vessel traffic to enhance safety by monitoring vessel movements more closely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extension of the compulsory pilotage area in the northern part of the great Barrier Reef to cover the Torres Strait area would further reduce the risk of groundings and collision. After all human error is the greatest risk to safe shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Torres Strait is an important and busy international shipping lane and Australia must be cognisant of the role of our neighbour, Papua New Guinea, and the international maritime community in seeking ways to improve safety</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in this ecologically vulnerable region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Torres Strait is a recognised international waterway, the extension of compulsory pilotage will involve comprehensive international negotiations. A successful outcome to those negotiations will be far more difficult to achieve than for the Barrier Reef which lies totally within Australian waters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Transport has asked AMSA to pursue the question of compulsory pilotage in the Torres Strait. Indeed it will now become AMSA's highest international priority in negotiations through the IMO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is pleasing to note that around 70 per cent of ships transiting Torres Strait already use marine pilots on a voluntary basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet there are a number of foreign flag vessels who place commercial considerations before their environmental conscience. We now intend to seek international acceptance of the need to carry pilots in these waters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While insisting on the greater use of pilotage in the marine environments we recognise that technology is constantly offering new ways to improve safety. The latest Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS) offer improved navigational safety. With DGPS, positioning accuracy is better than 10 metres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This technology is now available and is being trialled successfully by AMSA in Bass Strait and off the Pilbara.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today the Government wants to announce the establishment of a new DGPS broadcasting station on Horn island in the Torres Strait. It will be opened by October this year and will greatly improve the accuracy of ship positioning and assist individual ships to navigate safely in these difficult waters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the establishment of this station AMSA will insist on the compulsory use by pilots of transportable global positioning equipment. This will ensure that all ships being piloted, do so with the benefit of the improved DGPS navigational services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next few years will see the introduction of computer-based charting systems that provide further improvements to all navigational systems, on all types of vessels. As of now, a large amount of work has already been completed on this tech nology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of such a system can and should have implications beyond just the Reef. It has the capacity to extend to all of our precious Australian coast line. That makes it a huge undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such technology is costly to develop but it is an investment that Australia must make in the interests of our marine environment, and the safety of shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this day shipping oil spills remain the greatest threat to our coast line. They are a constant threat over which we must be forever vigilant. Vigilance will help prevention, or in the event of an unavoidable spillage, the ability to minimise the damage to our marine environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government is in the process of negotiating a Memorandum of Understanding with Papua New Guinea on cooperation and assistance in the event of a marine pollution incident affecting either country. This is of particular relevance to the Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is already considerable co-operation with PNG involving AMSA providing significant assistance to the PNG Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following a major review of NATPLAN in 1993, some 30 recommendations were made to improve planning and the capacity to respond to a major spill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Twenty-six have now been implemented and the remaining four are to be completed by the end of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Actions relevant to the Great Barrier Reef include</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The positioning of additional equipment in north Queensland and training for its use,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Development of an MOU between AMSA, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) and Queensland for safe havens for disabled or damaged ships,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Priority for research funding going to a bioremediation proposal to be managed by the GBRMPA;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extension of the on scene spill model to cover the Ribbon Reefs area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REEFPLAN, the regional version of NATPLAN, is currently undergoing its own review, which will be completed in mid 1995. The emphasis will be on prevention, on planning and on a rapid response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When taken together as a package, all these Federal Government measures enhance shipping safety in this most sensitive of areas. We have a great responsibility to current and future generations to protect what is the world's biggest and most beautiful reef, one of the world's great ecological treasures. It gives the Government great pleasure to detail these important initiatives aimed at protecting what we all hold dear. They are balanced initiatives, yet initiatives with foresight.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, I and the shadow minister, Mr Sharp, were unable to get a copy of this statement until quite late in the piece before the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) made the statement. We have not had a chance to look at it in detail. It seems that Mr Brereton has today announced some good initiatives for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef from shipping. In his statement, the minister has announced some initiatives that involve minimising shipping pressure in the inner route, additional steps to improve the safety of ships that use the inner route, improving navigational safety in the Torres Strait and improving the safety and reliability of the outer reef.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's statement contains a lot of very interesting statistics on the shipping use of both the inner and outer routes of the Great Barrier Reef. The minister has today made some announcements in relation to shipping in the reef. I and Senator Ferguson, amongst others, were on a Senate committee investigating major disasters in Australia that reported towards the middle of last year. That committee also highlighted problems with shipping incidents in the Great Barrier Reef area and made some recommendations, which the minister has dealt with in his statement today. Those recommendations of the committee dealt generally with better signage and better navigational aids in the reef area and generally looked at Australia's preparedness for any incident along the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Disaster management</EMPHASIS>, which is dated June 1994, did recommend that the funding be upgraded for the Australian Hydrographic Service sufficient to allow for identification of reefs and production of a series of accurate national charts and sailing directions suitable for modern navigation along them. Funding increases should be such as to allow for a production rate of at least 25 charts per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also recommended that the Commonwealth government work internationally towards the acceptance of compulsory pilotage in sensitive areas while establishing a register of such areas around Australia's coast with a view to their promotion for this service. Today Mr Brereton announced that he will be pursuing along those lines the question of compulsory pilotage in the Torres Strait area. The Torres Strait is an international waterway and does require some international acceptance. I am pleased to see that the government is pursuing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister announced in his statement today that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority will provide funding for the production of the charts. As I said, they are the charts which the Senate standing committee was calling for. That task will involve surveying that begins at Bramble Cay in the eastern approaches to the Torres Strait and goes down the Queensland coast to the end of the reef just north of Fraser Island, a total distance of some 2,000 kilometres. Simultaneously with the charting AMSA will proceed with the introduction of a mandatory ship reporting regime in the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the first stages of the cooperative approach to these initiatives will be the introduction of a vessel traffic system to cover the Torres Strait, the great north-east channel route near Cape York and the inner route. Extension of compulsory pilotage in the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef to cover the Torres Strait area would further reduce the risk of groundings and collisions. As Mr Brereton points out, human error is the greatest risk to safe shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the coalition are supportive of anything that is done to protect the Great Barrier Reef. We are pleased to see the government at last concentrating on these real problems and providing some money to address them. It is a bit sad to see that the government often gets itself tied up in the peripheral issues. We had the great furore over the Oyster Point proposal, one of the purposes of which, according to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), was to protect the Great Barrier Reef. That development at Oyster Point posed no threat to the Great Barrier Reef. It is just a pity that some of the energy and enthusiasm that Senator Faulkner's department puts into those sorts of issues is not transferred into these real issues of concern to the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have lived in the area of the Great Barrier Reef for most of my life, I can assure the government that it is a part of Australia that all of those people living along the coastline feel very strongly about. They are very attached to it and have a very protective attitude towards that reef. It does provide recreation. It does provide by way of fishing a big economy to the North Queensland area. North Queenslanders would generally welcome any measures that go towards protection of that reef. We have been lucky that there have been no major disasters in the Great Barrier Reef area for many years. These new initiatives that the government has announced will hopefully make it even safer and put off further the prospect of any major disaster in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the minister's statement. The coalition will generally support the initiatives proposed and any other initiatives which will, in effect, lead to a safer route through the Great Barrier Reef area and the long-term and lasting protection of one of the seven wonders of the world. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="1299" SPEAKER="MacGibbon D.J." NAMEID="YH4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (3.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement made by Senator Gareth Evans on behalf of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) on the Great Barrier Reef is a simple political document. It is very deceptive and it sets out to dupe a gullible Australian public into believing that the government is concerned and is trying to do something constructive about the use of the Barrier Reef waterway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major recommendation of the report is highly dangerous; that is, that traffic prefer an eastern passage in the open ocean, rather than coming up the inner passageway between the Barrier Reef and the Australian coastline. The second major recommendation&mdash;that pilotage be compulsory in the Torres Strait area&mdash;is at best a pious hope and is at worst, again, a deception because you simply cannot enforce compulsory pilotage in an international waterway, which the Torres Strait is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of better navigation aids, principally the use of a differential GPS system, is well worth supporting but that is something for the future; it is something that will not come in straightaway. But the most glaring omission in this whole report is the protection of the achilles heel of AMSA; that is, the lowering of pilotage standards in the Barrier Reef waterway, which is a consequence of the AMSA administration. There is not a word in here about the professional standards of pilots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just looking at those points very briefly, the argument is superficially attractive. To say that it is a safer area east when you are going north or south around the Barrier Reef is really quite false because you are in the open ocean. You are beyond the continental shelf. If there is any problem with the ship at all, if there is any fault with the propulsion system or the steering system, the ship simply cannot anchor. It is in an open sea state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all remember some years ago when the bow fell off an oil tanker by the name of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> off the Western Australian coast. I think 30,000 tonnes of oil were adrift on the ocean as a consequence of the bow falling off. That is not likely to occur within sheltered waters if the inner passageway is used. If a ship is disabled east of the Barrier Reef, the certainty of it is that it will become a total loss when it is blown on to the reef itself, because in those waterways for at least 10 months of the year there is a 25-knot south-east or north-east trade wind blowing and any disabled ship must be washed up on the reef and become a total loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conversely, if it is using the inner passageway between the Barrier Reef and the coastline, first of all, it will have a mandatory pilot service on board. Secondly, it can anchor anywhere if it is disabled and it may even be able to get into quite a safe anchorage. Thirdly, it is unlikely to be blown up on the shore. Fourthly, if the ship does break up, which again is unlikely because it is a sheltered waterway, the oil will go onto the beach and, tragic though that would be for places like Mission Beach and the many other excellent beaches in North Queensland, I think most people would agree it is better to have oil on a beach and on a coastline than on the reef structure itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, all the oil containment and oil dispersion systems that we have&mdash;and it ought to be noted that those are really quite limited in extent and most of them are based in Brisbane, not where the Barrier Reef is&mdash;will only operate in the sheltered waters inside the reef. Once you get into the outer reef there is no way any of the oil pollution or containment systems will work in any way at all in the open ocean. So the strong and repeated exhortations in this statement, that the outer reef be preferred to the inner reef as a route, is based on a total misunderstanding of the marine conditions that apply in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was going through <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> because I last spoke on this subject in 1991. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 10 October 1991 shows that Senator Collins was the minister in the chamber at the time. We were talking about a marine freight bill, I think. Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the Great Barrier Reef is concerned, again I am forced into a position of agreeing with Senator MacGibbon&mdash;that is twice in one morning. Options were put to the Government to take ships outside the reef because it was asserted that this would be safer. In fact, it would be horrendously more dangerous to the reef to do so. As Senator MacGibbon has said, it is not only true that the weather conditions are atrocious outside the reef, but also the area outside the reef is largely uncharted and is therefore considerably more dangerous to shipping. The result, as Senator MacGibbon has pointed out, of a major accident outside the reef would be as disastrous to the reef as if it happened inside the reef because of prevailing winds and tides.</PARA>
<PARA>Now I come to the business of compulsory pilotage in the Torres Strait area. It would be highly desirable that every ship that transits that waterway have a pilot on board. But the fact of life is that the Torres Strait area is an international waterway and while, in time, the International Maritime Organisation, the IMO, which is the governing body internationally in this area, can make a recommendation that pilots be carried by all ships transiting the Torres Strait, and most ships would, the point is the people we want to catch&mdash;the people who present a risk to the integrity of the reef&mdash;are the fly-by-night operators, the people with low capitalisation of their shipping lines and with old equipment. They are the very last people who will conform to any voluntary standard. So, while it is desirable that we negotiate towards compulsory pilotage in the Torres Strait area, it simply will not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to come to the major concern that I have with the reef at the present time, and that relates to the professional standards of the pilots who serve in the area. Once upon a time, the pilot service was provided by a company known, if my memory is correct, as the Queensland Coastal and Torres Strait Pilot Service. There was a popular misconception that this was a monopoly that charged high monopolistic fees. In actual fact, anyone could qualify for a licence from the Queensland Harbours and Marine Authority&mdash;which was the licensing authority at the time&mdash;so long as they met the standards. Those standards were a masters ticket, experience in command plus an intimate knowledge of the reef. The pilot licence was open to anyone who met those qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty in a practical sense was that you just cannot set up to be a pilot. You have to have a shore station, an office to accept the bookings, a communications and radio network to talk to ships that might be approaching, and launches and helicopters to get pilots on and off ships. In effect, it came down to only the Queensland Coastal and Torres Strait Pilot Service providing the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a lot of controversy about the charges. The charges were never set by the pilots themselves. The pilotage fees were always set by the Queensland government. When the legislation was changed to make pilotage compulsory from somewhere near Booby Island or Prince of Wales Island at the northern end in Torres Strait to a position about 100 nautical miles north of Cairns&mdash;that could be made compulsory because it was within Australian territorial waters&mdash;the Queensland government gave up its licensing of the pilots and it passed to AMSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic rationalists in the Labor Party believe that competition is good. They thought that, if they set-up a competitive system for the Torres Strait pilot service, fees would come down. The pilotage fee, from memory, would be about $6,000. Given the fact that, in the sum total of things, it probably costs close to $200,000 just to put a ship alongside at one of the major Queensland ports, a pilotage fee of $6,000 is really chickenfeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyway, they went ahead with the competition, and a competitive organisation was set up to compete with the old established pilot service. The competitive service could not get off the ground because no-one was ready to join it, apart from maybe five pilots who had fallen out with the old pilot company. The answer that AMSA adopted was to lower the professional standards. It reduced the requirements. We then had a price war erupting on the Queensland coast, and the pilotage fees fell to probably half what they were before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the former pilots earned a good income. I do not know how much it was, but from the service they provided it was probably about $100,000 a year. They had an impeccable record of safety. They were really good professionals. The fact that over a period of about 100 years we did not have any ships lost in service with a pilot is testimony to their professional skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When competition came along, their salaries were cut by somewhere between 25 and 50 per cent and the standard of recruit dropped right off. The pilot service today, about 18 months into this competitive situation, faces the situation where it cannot attract pilots with the experience needed to provide a safe service. This is really at the heart of my concern about the minister's statement today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is need to regulate this service in some way so that we attract master mariners who are experienced, who have command experience, and who know the area and will enter the profession of providing pilots for the service. It is not happening at the present time. The standards have been lowered by AMSA. Unless this is corrected, we will find that we have accidents on that route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report No. 9, which looked at the reef, made the statement that statistically there was a 37 per cent risk, over any five-year period, of a major oil spill as a consequence of a collision or grounding in the Barrier Reef waterways. Mr Deputy President, I can tell you that no minister, Liberal or Labor, has the courage to have a ship go up on the reef at any point and dump 10,000, 50,000 or 100,000 tonnes of oil into the Queensland coastal waters. It is a risk that we cannot accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way to minimise that risk is to re-establish adequate standards within the pilot ranks, because they are at the heart of the problem. Without adequate professional pilots with proper professional standards, all the navaids in the world and all the talk of going east-about means nothing at all. The great majority of shipping will continue to use the inner waterway between the Great Barrier Reef and the coast. That is the most glaring deficiency in this report that is before us today from the minister. The deficiency is there because we have a policy that was set in place by AMSA&mdash;and it just will not admit that it made a major mistake in that area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I have some further information on the Bowra case which goes to the question I was asked by Senator Ellison today. This information, which I had been seeking about the current status of Mr Bowra's incarceration, came to hand after question time and, indeed, after Senator Ellison had sat down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is this: Ambassador Weemas, who is based in Riyadh, has sought a call on the President of the Diwan in the presidential court on 7 March. It is to be hoped that he will be able to make that call and make the representations accordingly. The reason for that date is essentially that that is the end of the Ramadan period and the subsequent Eid holiday. It has been the general understanding that, whatever the fairness or otherwise of this, it has been wholly unlikely that there would be any action on this case until the end of the Ramadan and Eid periods. We are certainly hoping that action will take place very quickly. But the Ambassador will be there to add his voice to that, if he is able to get this appointment on 7 March&mdash;which is the first possible date in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the possible intervention of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in this, I advise the Senate that the Prime Minister will be making a transit stop only in Dubai on 6 March between 1.40 p.m. and 3.10 p.m.&mdash;in other words, just an hour and a half. Not only has this got a bit of a problem with the holiday period and the obvious shortness of time, but it also ought to be noted that the stop is in Dubai rather than Abu Dhabi, where the actual problem is. The United Arab Emirates is very much a federal, perhaps even a confederal, system where there are different systems of justice applicable in each emirate. So it is wholly unlikely, I think, that any representation the Prime Minister could possibly make in Dubai would be of utility in Abu Dhabi. I will check that point further, however, to make sure that that is so.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (3.45 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement the government made today in relation to shipping transport on the Great Barrier Reef is useful and in some respects is to be welcomed. But I must make the point that this statement overlooks the most important threat to the ecology of the Great Barrier Reef&mdash;which surprisingly would not be through something dramatic like a ship running aground and spilling oil, which would be a catastrophe. The greatest threat to the ecology of the Great Barrier Reef, which is particularly fragile, lies in the discharge of ballast water.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ballast water can contain exotic species which could poison fish, introduce molluscs and maybe even destroy the reef itself because the reef is a very fragile ribbon of living organisms. If that reef is contaminated&mdash;for example, by exotic molluscs or by algae which are toxic to fish or toxic to the coral&mdash;what we will have is an ecological disaster which cannot be remedied. So, whilst I welcome some of the initiatives contained in this statement&mdash;I will get on to them later&mdash;it shocks me that this report is so half-hearted as to miss the importance of providing adequate protection for the Great Barrier Reef to prevent ballast water discharge damaging the ecology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point is this: the Great Barrier Reef contains most of the ports in Queensland. Certainly, it contains some of the most busy ports in Queensland because it contains ports such as Gladstone, Hay Point, Abbot Point, Townsville, South Johnston, Mourilyan and places like that where bulk carriers come in every day to take away coal, to take away alumina and to take away sugar. In every case, those bulk carriers come in under ballast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the government tabled a report earlier this week pursuant to return to order which stated that something in the vicinity of 121 million tonnes of ballast water was discharged in Australia from over 6,000 vessels in the 1991-92 period. That ballast water content has in fact increased in the two or three years since then, but nothing is being done. The government's own report&mdash;as I said, it was tabled earlier this week&mdash;is shocking in the admission of how little is being done to deal with the problem, for that report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government cannot unilaterally prescribe how and where non-Australian government flag ships may take on ballast water in foreign ports.</PARA>
<PARA>Correct. However, it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, Australia, as a Port State, could impose conditions specifying how ships are to de-ballast when in Australian ports, particularly if the ships had taken on ballast water in certain overseas ports whose water contained an organism known to be harmful. The Government has not taken any such measures at this point in time because its policy on solving international shipping problems is to adopt a multilateral approach, by working through relevant organisations such as the IMO, and to avoid taking unilateral measures.</PARA>
<PARA>That would be fine if every other country had an environment that is like the Great Barrier Reef and is as fragile as ours. The ecological imperative on Australia is far higher than the ecological imperative on some other country which does not have that fragile environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sit here wondering why it is that a country like Singapore can prescribe very strict requirements on the de-ballasting of ships which come into its harbour&mdash;and Singapore's environment is nowhere near as fragile as ours&mdash;yet here we have ports on the eastern seaboard of Australia, ports in very close proximity to the Great Barrier Reef, which are visited daily by ships coming in under ballast and the government refuses to do anything about it because it wants to have a multilateral solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many years do we have to wait until we get a multilateral solution? How many ships under ballast will visit the Great Barrier Reef and the reef ports while we wait? The government's ministerial statement today is interesting. It says that there are some 1,700 movements through the inner route of the reef, 600 of which do not call at any Queensland port inside the reef. So I assume there are 1,100 movements through the reef where ships do visit Queensland ports&mdash;1,100 ships, the overwhelming majority of them coming in under ballast. That means that there are 1,100 opportunities a year for the contamination of the Great Barrier Reef and nothing is done because the government wants to have a multilateral solution. If the government is fair dinkum about protecting the reef, then the government will impose a few unilateral conditions on de-ballasting and, if necessary, work with the states to ensure that provisions are made so that ships can de-ballast into tanks where the water can be treated before being discharged. That is the only way to protect against this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to the other matters contained in the statement, and they are the four initiatives outlined by the government. These include minimising shipping pressure on the inner route, additional steps to improve the safety of ships that use the inner route, improving navigational safety in the Torres Strait, and improving the safety and reliability of the outer reef. There is a lot to commend most of those initiatives. I share Senator MacGibbon's concerns, however, about blindly assuming that running ships down the outer channel or outside the reef will necessarily solve the problem. It is correct that if a ship comes into difficulties outside the reef it cannot anchor, because the continental shelf drops straight off. That is why we have a barrier reef&mdash;the geology underneath the water is such that the continental shelf drops straight off. A ship in deep water can be blown back onto the reef because of the currents and wind. That is something we have to concern ourselves with. So the blind assumption that you run ships down outside the barrier reef is, in and of itself, not a solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are parts of this statement that are good. It is appropriate that work be done to improve navigational safety in the Torres Strait and to improve the safety of ships using the inner route. That is important because any time you have ships moving in shallow waters you always have the risk of a ship running aground. Accidents can happen. We also need to pay attention to modelling the currents on the reef. The currents on the reef are of particular importance to minimise the potential impact of any spill that may occur on the reef and also, where there are minor spills onto the reef, to track down the culprit ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously if a tanker runs aground, it is holed and we see millions of gallons of oil spilled onto the reef, we know who is at fault, because the ship is on the reef. But it is entirely possible that a ship could spill oil into the water, still be perfectly seaworthy and blithely sail right out in the hope that nobody knows. So if we could improve the modelling of the currents on the Great Barrier Reef, then we could track down ships which have improperly allowed oil to spill out and therefore hold the masters and the owners of those ships responsible for the environmental damage which they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is another consequence from properly modelling the currents on the reef. In the event of a spill, we will have a very good idea where that oil is going to end up. It is a very complex task. We have an inordinately long coastline, we have a myriad of reefs, we have changing currents from month to month and we have different wind conditions and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very difficult task, but it is something we have to do because, if we are to be prepared for a spill&mdash;and we have to assume that a spill is going to happen&mdash;we must know where the oil is going to move. In that fashion you can get the equipment to the right place to ensure that you protect the reef from the oil spill. There is no use having all of the equipment in, say, Mackay, if the oil spill is not going to be on that section of the reef, if it is going to be 100 kilometres to the north. It takes time to move and deploy these things. The couple of hours in question may be the couple of hours in which the oil comes ashore or hits a reef and the damage is done. So that aspect, which is relegated to the very last page of the government's statement, should be taken more seriously. It is insufficient to say that it is just one of the things we have to look at. It has to be a very high priority. In terms of the issues addressed it should be one of the highest priorities. Unless we do that, we will be caught unprepared if an accident happens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens (WA) welcome the initiatives by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). As a number of speakers have already mentioned, they are certainly not sufficient as yet. It is pleasing to see that the government has acknowledged the importance of protecting Australia's coastlines. I trust that the shipping industry will also support these initiatives. Compulsory pilotage in the Torres Strait as well as on the inside route through the Great Barrier Reef is long overdue. The extent of reefs and islands and the narrow passage of the Torres Strait, combined with the strong tides and currents, create a climate that is just waiting for a major accident to happen. Hopefully, pilotage could substantially reduce that risk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals to improve the quality of navigation charts in the region, together with the increased use of global positioning system technology on land and on ships, will also go some way to reducing the risk in the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait shipping routes. In addition, the establishment of a radar traffic system is essential. I trust that the timetable for its implementation will be expedited. In the statement there was some mention of the standard of shipping but the mention indicates that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority is involved with more inspections. Yes it is, but as I have mentioned on a number of occasions, including on AMSA's annual reports, that does not mean there are more people to do those inspections; it is probably related to the fact that we have more single voyage permits every year and the standard of shipping internationally and around Australia's waters has not necessarily improved. So more inspections do not necessarily reflect a higher standard of shipping; they reflect the fact that we are in a very vulnerable position with Australia's very large area of coastline, added to the fact that there are more ships which should be inspected. So if there are more inspections and fewer staff it means that each inspection cannot necessarily be as effective as it might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some mention from Senator O'Chee with regard to ballast and I agree that there is a huge problem with ballast. The response the government has given so far in relation to its lack of desire for unilateral action reflects also its lack of desire to take unilateral actions with regard to a liability regime. That has been mentioned by me on previous occasions. The United States, for a start, has a liability regime which tries to make sure that, if there is a major accident, somebody is responsible for it. There is not much point in trying to get the money back from a fairly limited liability company, I suppose, if we are accepting more and more single voyage permits or flag of convenience carriers. But there needs to be some line of accountability. There is no point in Australia waiting, whether it is in relation to ballast water agreements or liability regimes, for everybody else in the world to agree; it is our country that is at risk, our environment and our very precious coastal ecosystems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of a liability regime that incorporates compensation for environmental harm and non-economic loss for marine-based oil pollution needs to be addressed. I have noted the government's comments in relation to this issue in a report that was provided to this parliament as a result of a Senate resolution late last year. I feel it is important that Australia pursue this issue in the international community, particularly given our isolation and consequent reliance on shipping, but it is not enough, as I said, that we pursue this as simply a multilateral action. If the international community will not act because of a desire to protect corporate profits, through lower costs of shipping and lower standards of shipping, then it is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I make a plea to the government on behalf of the environmental movement, the fishing industry and the tourism industry to establish some similar protection measures on the north-west coast. There is already an extensive oil industry in the North West Shelf area and it is in close proximity to the ecologically important Ningaloo Reef and the fishing grounds and tourist areas at Exmouth and Broome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a possibility that the risk in these areas could increase as a result of the measures taken to protect the Great Barrier Reef. It may actually mean that some ships will take that other route as a means of getting an easier passage. Many vessels have the option of travelling across the north of Australia to get to Sydney or Melbourne or of travelling the Western Australian coast and around the Great Australian Bight. If the cost of travel is, justifiably, increased due to the requirement for compulsory pilotage, some shipping companies will take the cheaper option and travel through these important areas of Western Australia. I trust that the government will give serious consideration to addressing these issues in Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a need to examine in detail the statement that was presented today. I compliment the government for at least making a start on what is a very important issue. I concur with most of what has been said by previous speakers in relation to this statement. I will read the statement in more detail and perhaps comment on it at another time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In January I was in Cairns to launch a report by the Cairns and Far North Environment Centre entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The ever present danger of an oil spill on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia</EMPHASIS>. At that launch I was involved with the director of the local tourist association who raised many of the same fears that were expressed by the environment centre. I will read from the report that was launched at that time because it provides a useful comment on what the government has done. I think the Environment Centre will be pleased with the start the government has made in meeting some of the concerns it has raised. It is interesting to note that the report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The International Maritime Organisations resolution A710(17) States: IMO recommends that ships of 70 metres and over and all tankers carrying oil, chemicals and liquefied gas to use the Australian Commonwealth licensed pilotage service when navigating the Torres Strait and the Great North East Channel between Booby Island and Bramble Cay. However 10% of all vehicles travelling through these two areas chose to ignore IMO's recommendations posing a huge risk to this sensitive area.</PARA>
<PARA>I notice in the government's statement that there is a slight difference in terms of the percentages, but I do not know that that really matters. I support the call of the environment centre in its report where it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We call for mandatory pilotage of all ships of 70 metres in length or more travelling through Torres Strait and the Great North East Channel.</PARA>
<PARA>I note what Senator MacGibbon said about the difficulty of doing this. I believe we as Australians, and certainly the Australian government, need to put all the pressure we possibly can on those ships that are not observing the resolution of the International Maritime Organisation to adhere to that recommendation. It is critical. Another recommendation in the Environment Centre's report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We call for the Australian Government and AMSA to encourage other countries to establish tanker surveillance programmes. The Australian Government and AMSA must establish a programme whereby tanker standard and competence of crew on vessels are checked before entering Australian waters. Improper lashing of containers on vessels is currently a major concern.</PARA>
<PARA>Another recommendation which fits in very well with the government's statement, and one that I support, is the one that states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We call for a designated surveyed separation lane via the Coral Sea for all transit shipping. There must be a buffer zone between the separation lane and the reef.</PARA>
<PARA>It appears that the government's recommendation goes some of the way to satisfying that. Finally, the environmental report, endorsed by the tourist association in Cairns, reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We call for Establishment of DGPS&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>differential global positioning systems&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">service for Marine navigation purposes along the Great Barrier Reef, to increase navigational safety and minimise grounding and collisions.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to say that there seems to be a real coming together of various interests in this whole area of protection of the Great Barrier Reef. When tourist associations and environmental groups and groups like the various fishing organisations all agree, then obviously there is strong support for government action in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, I visited Cairns again with Dr Bob Morris, who is an internationally recognised marine scientist. I spent two days with him visiting the reef. I did a little bit of snorkelling. He did much more than I did because I am not really up to it. It was a very useful visit. I spent two days and he spent a week on the reef consulting with the Department of Environment and Heritage and other people and looking at various problem areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree to a certain extent with Senator O'Chee, whom I do not always agree with, that one of the problems is not just an oil spill but the dumping of bilge water. I looked at one problem at a place called Richters Creek near Yorkey's Knob where, before Christmas, 400,000 litres of liquid containing at least 25 per cent of highly polluting oil was dumped within 200 metres of the ocean; in other words, within 200 metres of the possibility of polluting the reef. So, it is not simply what ships might do; it is also the fact that liquid&mdash;it was mostly bilge water and other liquids from ships dumped on the shore&mdash;also has the potential to greatly damage the reef. Another concern which was drawn to our attention when we were in Cairns was the dumping of dredge material close to Trinity Outlet, again allowing very dangerous and polluting substances to leach into Trinity Bay and, therefore, to affect the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to what Senator Macdonald said, the marine scientist whom I took with me was also doing work on the Oyster Point, Port Hinchinbrook development. His opinion was that it is quite clearly a threat to the Great Barrier Reef, and his investigations confirm the dangers associated with the projected dredging of the Hinchinbrook Channel. When his detailed report is available to me, I will make that report available to the Senate and, of course, to the government. I close by commending this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak briefly on this ministerial statement and to observe, first of all, the inadequate time which is allowed for discussing very important documents such as this. I think it is a great pity that this document arrived on my fax machine only a very short time before the matter arose in the Senate chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which these matters are dealt with&mdash;namely, that we are expected pretty much to discuss them as soon as the statement has been tabled&mdash;is somewhat unsatisfactory, particularly in view of the great importance of the Great Barrier Reef. I think the previous speakers have drawn attention to that, and I think it would be an excellent idea if the Senate were to consider the availability of these ministerial statements a day or so before they actually came to be discussed in the chamber. Having said that, I draw attention to that part of the statement which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this day shipping oil spills remain the greatest threat to our coast line. They are a constant threat of which we must be forever vigilant. Vigilance will help prevention, or in the event of an unavoidable spillage, the ability to minimise the damage to our marine environment.</PARA>
<PARA>The point I make with respect to this is that, while we might improve the security of ships by pilotage, by ensuring we do not have rust buckets going up and down the coast or by perhaps putting more ships outside the reef, although I am not convinced in relation to this; nonetheless, all the evidence is that sooner or later we will have a major oil spill on the Barrier Reef and that very considerable damage will be done. The inadequacy of dealing with that oil spill, I think, is the thing to which the government needs to give a great deal more attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that Senator Ray is here in the chamber because he will know that on numerous previous occasions I have pointed to the value to Australia of buying the Canadair CL215 aircraft, which is an amphibious aircraft well capable of going to remote oil spills on the Barrier Reef and dealing with the spill either by way of dispersant or by way of landing on the water and putting out booms, something which cannot be done at the moment. We are still in the situation in which a major oil spill has to be tackled essentially from either end of that 1,000 kilometres of reef extending between Cairns and the Torres Strait. We do not have an ability to intervene quickly should a spill occur somewhere perhaps halfway along that stretch of reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This aircraft would be useful not only in that capacity but also in a whole range of other activities. It has particularly been developed for firefighting, picking up six tonnes of water in 10 seconds. It could be used for offshore surveillance, northern surveillance and a whole range of other things. I think it is a great pity that we have not bought a fleet of these aircraft and multi-tasked them so they could take on this whole range of activities, which would actually reduce the cost for each particular activity. It is quite true, as has often been said against these aircraft, that they are expensive at $25 million each. To keep them purely for northern surveillance or to keep them purely for firefighting individually would be too expensive. However, by multi-tasking them I think it would be an extremely reasonable purchase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I stress is that this stretch of 1,000 kilometres of Great Barrier Reef is still extremely vulnerable to an oil spill. We do not have adequate protection in place and sooner or later an oil spill will occur and we will deal with it totally inadequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I welcome this statement, I think we need to go further. We need to look particularly at how we can more adequately deal with oil spills. I think there is a technology by which we could do that more adequately and far better than we do at the present time. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last annual report to Parliament on the aid program, which my colleague the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs tabled at the end of 1993, the Government's approach to poverty alleviation through its aid program was set out. That report emphasised the importance of sustainable economic growth and social development proceeding in tandem.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report also covers the major achievements of the aid program over the past 12 months and I shall begin my comments by outlining some of the most important of these achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the need for continued budgetary restraint in order to consolidate the economic recovery in Australia, the Government demonstrated its commitment to international development by increasing Australia's aid program by 3.6 per cent in real terms. This meant that we were one of only four of the 21 OECD donors who increased their aid programs in the last year. As a result, Australia continues to remain above the average for donors in terms of aid to GNP ratio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aid volume apart, there have been significant changes in our region, not least in Indochina and the South Pacific. Further afield, the transition to democracy in South Africa will change the nature of economic relationships throughout Southern Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I will now draw attention to significant developments in Australia's relationship with the South Pacific. During the run-up to the South Pacific Forum, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs gave a speech to the Foreign Correspondents Association highlighting the need for policy reforms in the region. The overriding theme of his address was the need for the region's governments to develop improved national policies to encourage sustainable social and economic growth. I am pleased to say that this theme was taken on board by regional leaders and, as a result, the Forum generated an unprecedented level of commitment to improve economic and environmental policies, particularly in forestry. Just recently, a code of conduct on logging was signed by Forum Island Countries, and only last week a meeting of the region's Finance Ministers took place at which crucial policy issues were discussed, including fiscal, forestry and civil aviation matters, which have been identified as priorities by island leaders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Papua New Guinea we have agreed on a radical transformation of the program. By the end of the decade, the program will have completely moved from budget support to jointly-programmed project activities.</PARA>

In May 1994, we announced a four-year, $350 million package, targeted at the high-priority areas of health, infrastructure, education, human rights and the strengthening of legal institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most visible examples of the effectiveness of our development assistance is the Mekong River Friendship Bridge. It is the first road link between Laos and Thailand and will yield substantial economic benefits to both countries. Moreover, as one of the highest-profile aid projects undertaken by Australia in recent years&mdash;and, incidentally, a project completed ahead of schedule and under budget&mdash;the bridge is an invaluable showcase for Australian capabilities in major infrastructure design and technology transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to draw members' attention to the Government's response to the tragedy of Rwanda. The Government has so far contributed $35 million to support the relief effort there, a contribution matched by an extraordinary public response of over $30 million. Australia's response was one of the earliest and, from my observations, one of the most effectively targeted of all donors. At the same time, and despite our limited resources, we have begun an increased program to support the peaceful transition to majority rule in South Africa providing assistance of $30 million over three years. This program has been designed to meet the objectives of the Government of National Unity's Reconstruction and Development Program, including through building up capacity in areas such as planning, economic policy and the media.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have also been important developments in the sectoral focus of Australia's aid program. In particular, we have continued to expand environmental assistance, and in this financial year we will spend around $120 million on these activities. Amongst other things, this funding will cover the establishment of what we are calling `Green DIFF', part of the highly successful Development Import Finance Facility which has been the catalyst for many Australian companies to become involved in the region. Green DIFF will help to finance environmental projects in areas such as pollution control and energy efficiency, gaining wider exposure for Australia's environmental expertise. The last budget also heralded an Australian contribution of nearly $43 million to replenish the Global Environment Facility, as well as an increase in support for the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A vibrant private sector is an essential part of the development process. Initiatives such as the Private Sector Linkages Program, which has seen its budget double to $10 million, are targeted at this sector. In addition, the informal sector is now recognised as a fundamental resource for social and economic development. Australia's aid program is reflecting this with an increased allocation of funds to micro-enterprise development with a two-year, $1.3 million package for development in the South Pacific and South East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change in the role of the private sector in development is just one example of the way that the aid program has adapted to remain relevant and effective. Another excellent example is provided by this year's launch of the policy document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a Sustainable Future: Ecologically Sustainable Development through Australia's Development Cooperation Program</EMPHASIS>. Australia's policy in this area fully takes into account the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio by defining the importance of integrating the economic, social and ecological dimensions of development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The past year has also seen the Government continue to pursue policies on human rights and good governance through the aid program. On human rights, Australia's policy is to maintain a consistent and principled stand against abuses, while stressing the importance of continued engagement through dialogue and institution-building. On good governance, Australia's policy encourages the effective management of social and economic resources in developing countries in a manner that is open, transparent, accountable, and equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you can see, over the past year we have continued a process of review and adaptation which will ensure that Australia's aid program continues to be of the highest quality, responsive to the needs of developing countries and appropriate to Australia's place in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like now to turn to new developments in our overseas assistance in the social sector. The Government's policy framework for poverty reduction has three components:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">encouraging sustainable economic growth;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">investment in human resources through education, health, capacity building and social sector development; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">provision of safety nets and poverty targeting, including humanitarian relief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The social sector provides a crucial contribution to sustainable social and economic development. Recent World Bank reports have highlighted the major role that government commitment to social sector development, particularly in education, has played in the rapid growth of many Asian economies. Reflecting this importance, the past two budgets have seen a significant upgrading of the already high priority given to the social sector in the aid program through the introduction of major population and health initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1993-94 budget, we trebled expenditure on the population sector with a four-year $130 million initiative. To ensure the effectiveness of this initiative, the Government commissioned an independent inquiry into the links between population and development. This was one of the most comprehensive surveys of population and development issues ever undertaken, and its conclusions have been vital in highlighting the complex links between population and development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The results of this inquiry have helped AIDAB to develop a range of principles which now guide the aid program's population activities. Amongst the most important of these principles is that access to safe and effective family planning services is a fundamental right; and that women should have access to a wide range of reproductive health services and should participate fully in defining the services they need. Above all&mdash;and I emphasise this most emphatically&mdash;coercion has no place in Australian aid program's family planning activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The priority which the aid program affords population issues was reflected in the major role that Australia played at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in September 1994. Helped by our efforts, the Conference adopted a ground-breaking program of action for the empowerment of women, and called for major increases in global resources for family planning and health activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would also like to refer to the significant developments in the nature of our assistance to the health sector. Funding for health was given a major boost in the 1994-95 aid budget with the introduction of a four-year initiative targeting four priority areas&mdash;malaria, polio, neonatal tetanus, and HIV/AIDS. The initiative involves additional funding of $110 million over four years nearly doubling Australia's current spending on health under the aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with assistance for population activities, AIDAB has developed a set of principles which will guide this new funding. These principles state that improvements in health are best achieved through an integrated approach which tackles the causes of poverty and improves the status and well being of vulnerable groups, particularly women and children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes are also afoot in Australia's program of assistance to education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assistance to the education sector has always been a large part of the aid program. At present, the sector receives an allocation of around 20% of the total budget. The majority of this funding goes towards assistance at the tertiary level. We are now reviewing our assistance in the sector, with a view to diversifying the kinds of assistance to include increased support for basic, technical and vocational education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt of the social, economic, health and population gains that are derived from basic education. At the same time, the primary responsibility for the provision of basic education lies with the recipient government&mdash;aid should not substitute for that responsibility. That means that our assistance to the education sector must be carefully targeted to assist and strengthen, rather than replace or duplicate, the efforts of national governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Mr President, I would like to talk about developments in the humanitarian relief program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most tragic features of the past few years has been the continued increase in the frequency and impact of international emergencies. In the past five years over 300 million people have been affected by natural disasters and civil strife. Over the past 20 years, the numbers of refugees rose from an estimated 3 million to 23 million, half of whom are children and most of whom are from developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a huge cost in human terms. It is also a huge financial cost. Just to give you an example; the annual expenditure of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has risen from US$450 million in the mid eighties to US$1.1 billion in 1993 and the cost of UN peace keeping operations has risen from under $1 billion in 1991 to over US$4 billion in 1993. This trend shows no sign of slowing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The forces driving this situation are highly complex, demanding an equally complex international response. Factors such as the link between poverty and vulnerability, the increase in political volatility since the end of the Cold War, and the proliferation of humanitarian relief agencies, have to be taken into account in providing a coordinated response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was against this backdrop of increasing complexity and growing demand for assistance that, early last year, AIDAB undertook an extensive review of its refugee and relief program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The results of this review are helping the Government to update Australia's response to international humanitarian emergencies. The review found that Australia's spending on humanitarian relief had not followed the rapid increase of other donors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This relative decline in funding for humanitarian emergencies is in stark contrast to the clear wishes of the Australian public, which has repeatedly demonstrated that it wants its Government to respond generously to such humanitarian tragedies as those witnessed in Rwanda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDAB is already responding to the recommendations of the review and is also exploring opportunities for increasing funds for humanitarian relief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Australia improves its aid response to international humanitarian emergencies, we also share a responsibility with the international community to do more to prevent disasters and complex emergencies from happening in the first place. This is a priority that requires a range of strategies addressing the underlying causes of dispute and conflict. We require improvements in prevention and response strategy through arrangements which minimise threats to security, promote confidence and trust, and create frameworks for dialogue and cooperation. We must also develop peace-building activities to ensure that conflict does not arise in the first place, or if it does, to ensure that it does not recur. That involves strategies which encourage economic and social development, environmental protection, human rights and good governance. Australia will be doing as much as possible through the aid program to support these activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the years ahead, I am confident that Australia will continue to deliver a compassionate and effective aid program that has a real impact on the lives of millions of people throughout the developing world. Australia's future, and the Australian people, demand nothing less.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This statement about new directions in Australia's overseas aid program is an important one. It is apparently made about once a year by the minister who is responsible for Australia's development assistance. It is a rather brief statement, and it appeals to values that are well accepted on both sides of the chamber and, indeed, by the Australian public. There is one reference to humanitarian relief which indicates that the Australian government is self-critical for not giving humanitarian assistance to the extent that it appears the Australian public would want the Australian government to give it. I welcome the candour that the government has shown in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government is right. When the Australian public is touched by children dying in Rwanda and the chaos arising from a tragic civil war, they give to non-government organisations&mdash;even though that giving is to an extent subsidised by tax deductibility offered by the Australian government&mdash;and this compassion of the Australian public leads to large subscriptions of money and throws into a shadow the assistance that the Australian government is directly giving, despite it being some $35 million for Rwanda so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that we in this parliament do need to encourage the Australian government to respond to those expressions of compassion and of justice, and to ensure that children in the world, refugees and others displaced by war and natural calamities, are given resources to meet their urgent human needs. That is especially so having regard to an affluent country like Australia, where we have more than a handful of suits to wear, swimming pools, backyards, too many cars on the roads and every manner of convenience. I think that development assistance is an area that, from time to time, grabs the full attention of the Australian public, and it ought to grab more of the attention of the Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is a reference at the beginning of the statement that is rather self-congratulatory which says that Australia has increased its aid program over the last 12 months by 3.6 per cent in real terms. It says that this is a greater degree of increase than for most of the OECD donor countries, and it remains above average for donor countries from the OECD in terms of it being a proportion of GNP. They are minor badges of merit that the Australian government gives itself and gives all Australia. Frankly, it is way below the UN standard, which is the objective that the Labor Party has accepted as appropriate and that the coalition has accepted as appropriate. It is only half of that amount. I do not believe that any of us can congratulate ourselves for giving an appropriate proportion of our gross national product to overseas aid. </PARA>

Before the last election and the one before that, the Liberal and National parties were too honest in setting forth our policy of keeping that objective but implementing some cuts, especially in multilateral aid. We were given heaps by the Labor Party for that honesty, yet it did the same thing in government and did not live up to its own precise commitments with regard to development assistance. All I am saying is that on the first page of this statement by the minister a few badges are awarded, but not the ones that matter. We need a lack of hypocrisy in the competition we have at election time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is reference to some special developments in the South Pacific with regard to Papua New Guinea, Indochina and Rwanda. I have read these paragraphs and welcome them all. The Australian initiative with regard to forestry in the South Pacific is important. When we back it up with some cash to gain agreement in the South Pacific forum, it will be a good thing. It is long overdue that by the end of the 1990s we reach the target in Papua New Guinea of transforming our very substantial aid from budget support to jointly programmed project activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to Indochina. I am very glad to see that a $350 million package over a four-year period is directed especially at the high priority areas of health, infrastructure, education, human rights and the strengthening of legal institutions. Justice Michael Kirby has met with parliamentarians as the UN's special raconteur on human rights in Cambodia. In his observations, he has called for this kind of assistance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is probably done for propaganda purposes to try to get more support in the community for increased development assistance. That can be done in a number of ways. But, when you are talking about a document that is tabled before the parliament, the minister should know that there are a few hardheads in the parliament who are going to have a look at it to see just where the new directions are and what directions are going to fit and be tested against separate criteria in terms of their effectiveness. Unfortunately, this document does not do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 1 talks in rather glowing terms about the  achievement of the government of a real increase in the size of Australia's overseas aid effort by 3.6 per cent. What we have to realise is that it has not kept pace with GDP. The document does acknowledge that. It says, `Oh well, it hasn't kept pace; Australia was one of only four OECD donors to achieve an increase in aid volume in 1993.' It then talks about its current aid standing at 0.33 per cent of GNP, which is substantially better than the 0.30 per cent of OECD donors combined. So what! We are responsible for seeing that the amount is not only increased but increased more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into great detail as Senator Margetts may well want to say something briefly.

As I have said in the estimates committee time and time again, I believe we have not played our role in the development assistance area in Africa as well as we should have. We are going to have to do something more than that which has already been done.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Egg production is associated in the minds of many people with the terrible image of hens crammed into battery cages. The practice of caging hens for egg production developed due to the belief that this enabled maximum productivity and economic efficiency. Whilst I am not saying that economic considerations are not important, they should not be the only factor used in assessing the suitability of our food production processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no good reason why, once an animal is identified as being suitable for the purposes of producing food for humans, all considerations for the welfare of that animal should disappear. Putting any bird or animal in a cage so small it cannot turn around would be quite rightly seen as inexcusable by most people if it were in a zoo or kept as a pet. The Democrats believe the same standard should apply when the animal is being used to produce food for us to consume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This general principle is one that is of great importance, as serious consideration is being given at the moment to greatly expanding the commercial use of native wildlife in Australia for food production and other commercial uses. But if the use of kangaroos, emus, possums, bandicoots, crocodiles and other Australian wildlife becomes common place, it is likely that the same disregard for their welfare will occur. This is something the Democrats would strongly oppose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a lot of work from many people concerned about the problem of battery cages, there have been some moves to more easily enable the sale of eggs which are clearly labelled as being free range. Whilst this sort of consumer driven demand for reform is vital in the food industry, I believe the industry must also consider basic ethical standards and work harder to improve the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, minimum cage sizes were agreed to by the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand, ARMCANZ, which is made up of primary industry ministers from all states and territories and chaired by the federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it is good that minimum cage sizes will become regulatory and enforceable across Australia from the start of 1996, it is unfortunate that it was accompanied by a reversal of a 1992 code of practice which gave hens more space. The actual size allowed and the slowness of moves away from caging birds are matters of great concern to the Australian Democrats. The minimum floor space allowable for each bird is 450 square centimetres, which is less than the size of an A4 page.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wheat Board report for 1993-94 has been around for quite some time, and I am sure it has been read by almost every senator in this place. However, this gives me an opportunity to address something else concerning the Wheat Board, the Grains Council of Australia and the allied industry generally. I refer to the report of the strategic planning unit commissioned by the Grains Council of Australia and paid for, in the order of $2 million, by the Grains Research and Development Corporation of Australia&mdash;commonly known as the SPU report. That $2 million enabled the report to go virtually from seed and fertiliser right through to the bread on the table, but it was long on narration and very short on recommendations. I believe that the report, to a certain extent, simply provides the Wheat Board with a self-fulfilling prophecy rather than spelling out the situation facing the Wheat Board and what sort of marketing&mdash;say, single desk marketing&mdash;we will have in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I would like to address more in my limited time&mdash;and, incidentally, I thought it was 10 minutes for each speaker but obviously it is five; so I will have to cut my remarks rather short, unless some kind person on the other side will move that my time be extended&mdash;is the wheat industry fund. It is no secret that I have been trying to get an inquiry into the wheat industry fund for quite some time in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, it came about that in 1989, with the Wheat Marketing Act, virtually two per cent of all wheat sales was to go into a fund to provide a guaranteed underwriting for when the government underwriting will disappear from that act in about 1999. At the present moment the fund has $200 million&mdash;and, incidentally, nearly half of that comes from Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have no definition of direction. That is why I am looking for an inquiry to be undertaken into what that fund has been used for. When Booz, Allen and Associates brought out that report&mdash;actually, there were three reports&mdash;one of the consultants, Sam Hill, on delivering his findings in Western Australia, picked up the point of the wheat industry fund. Very little mention had been made of it in the written report. However, when he was delivering his findings, he was rather vicious in his attack on the way the wheat industry fund might be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sam Hill identified that the wheat industry fund had three facets: firstly, as providing a guarantee for borrowings, and that is what we passed legislation on; secondly, as a strategic investment fund actively working to lift returns to growers; and, thirdly, as a retirement fund for grain growers who believe that they will get their money back. He went on to say that the fund cannot cover all three of these functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I remind you that the fund was established in the beginning to provide a guarantee for borrowings. The Wheat Board and the Grains Council of Australia in their wisdom think they can use this fund, gathered from growers, for purposes they think fit, but which may not necessarily be in the interests of wheat growers in Australia, and the wheat growers of Western Australia in particular. I will certainly be pushing much harder to come to get this inquiry. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be speaking today on only one of this group of reports&mdash;that is, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cultivating the human factor: employment and skills in Australia's rural industries</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and I will be seeking leave to continue my remarks later. What I see here is a series of failures of vision and understanding. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cultivating the human factor</EMPHASIS> is part of the title of this report, but is that what it is really about? It is about the rural sector in relation to competing in the global economy. We have seen again and again that, in relation to the rural sector&mdash;especially agricultural industries&mdash;both major parties are interested in promoting global competitiveness and think the way to do this is through restructuring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the World Trade Organisation debate last year, we heard that the citrus industry and other industries would have to restructure. It was clear that this meant the end of small and medium business and the consolidation of farms and orchards. That is what the small growers saw, and that is what the big growers saw. The way things are going, small producers are doomed. Big producers can survive because by owning large acreage and employing people on a minimal outlay on an as needed basis they can get by, whereas family farms working on a smaller holding have a hard time because they have to support themselves continually. That is what we are told. In light of that, I cannot understand why any surprise is expressed, as it has been here, at the difficulties of attracting young people into the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy to plug into the jargon. On page 21 we see talk of inappropriate labour and characteristics of the situation as being partly inappropriate and/or inadequate on-the-job training and partly a problem of developing attractive career paths, especially for young people. Attractive career paths? We have to be kidding! Employers are under stress to pay workers less to compete internationally with nations like Brazil and the banana republics. So we have some people who might, if they cannot find a real job, lob in and pick fruit for a few weeks on marginal wages or, if they are lucky, pick for a few months. Usually they can camp out in tents or sleep in their cars so that they can minimise their costs and low wages are not so important. Besides, that is liable to be more fun than hanging around without work or money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there will be a labour force, but it is stupid to talk about career paths. It is a young person's job when they cannot find anything else to do, and it is a job for the sort of people who find themselves going mad when shut up inside. It is short-term, both in job security and in relation to the period of one's life when they follow such a path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said there is no vision here. Following the path of international competitiveness will not fix anything. If the government is really serious about small and medium business in rural communities, it will have to broaden its vision. It cannot largely concentrate on jobs in monoculture, agriculture, forestry and mining. What amazes me is that I see nothing here&mdash;not a subject heading, not a statistic&mdash;that indicates there is a tourism or hospitality sector, agricultural value added industries, or services in rural communities. Yet the most vital small rural towns have a high level of these activities as well as businesses that work in well, such as cultural businesses, furniture making, artisan work and art businesses&mdash;places like Maleny which have other sophisticated industries. Under growing rural enterprises we again get the song and dance about international export. There is life inside the global economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of agriculture, monoculture is a problem&mdash;not a solution. Sales and markets, even international sales and markets, could be addressed through things like producers' cooperatives that would allow smaller farms to compete. There is no mention of training for this. It would also allow farms to move more in the direction of diversification. That would be an advantage both in terms of markets where prices are unreliable and in terms of a nation where weather is unreliable. We see government elsewhere talking about the need for restructuring agriculture to deal with drought and climate change. Surely diversification is one way, yet nothing is said about how to make diversification work. Perhaps some training in this and in setting up growers' co-ops, which are a fine old agricultural tradition, would be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the whole issue of looking at establishing and working in local and regional markets, instead of global ones, and managing farms in a more integrated way. We have  community after community&mdash;certainly in Western Australia&mdash;where the primary activity is agri-pastoral activity, and yet food is imported from Perth, other capital cities or even overseas. What about employment schemes and small business assistance in providing local food markets? These can be as simple as providing a parking lot or school verandah once a week where farmers can bring produce. I have a great deal more to say on this issue.

<PARA>We have seen over the last few weeks an absolute debacle in communications policy. We have a minister who has failed an extremely simple test of ministerial competence. We have recently seen the West Indies series of cricket tests, which many Australians love to watch, absolutely destroyed by the debacle caused by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). Quite simply what has happened is that the minister has created a list of programs that should be on free-to-air TV. That means, of course, that it cannot be siphoned off&mdash;to use the expressions used&mdash;to the pay TV networks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During a period of about eight months we have had ample opportunity to put this new system in place. But what we have seen happen in the last few weeks is the minister flip-flopping from side to side, being totally indecisive over how this matter should be resolved. We are now seven days away from the cricket series. Fans in Australia are about to miss out and the West Indies cricket board is about to lose an enormous amount of money because of the way this has been handled by this minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a rare and isolated event; this is part of a long series of policy gaffs by the minister for communications. What this minister is all about is show. What we saw yesterday was the release of the report on the information superhighway and multimedia services from the Broadband Services Expert Group. We have had a look at this report. It is an absolutely excellent report, top rate&mdash;but it is a little late. What we have seen over the last few years is the various media operators in this very dynamic communications industry work out how to position themselves well to take advantage of the booming communications industry. What the government has decided to do, after a lot of these operations are getting well under way, is to call for a report on what it should do in terms of a legislative framework to control these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The horse has bolted. The system is operating out there. The very dynamic communications market is off and running. Billions of dollars have been involved in rolling out the information superhighway. Tens of millions of dollars are involved in developing various products and all of this is happening within a communications vacuum. We have the situation&mdash;with converging technologies of television, computers and telephones&mdash;of a great need, as I have said before in this place, for a uniform system where we have one converging technology legislative framework that takes into account the operation of people on television, telephones and computers as these industries merge and as the products move between those different types of mediums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the minister doing? He called for a report. We have a report. Where is the legislative base? When are we going to get that? It has taken several years to get this report. Let us hope for the sake of Australian communications that it does not take several years to get the proper legislative base. That is not the only problem we have had with this minister in terms of the sorts of things he has been doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a huge problem also in recent weeks with cross-media ownership rules. The government again is flip-flopping, dillydallying and trying to decide which way it should go in terms of cross-media ownership rules. Are we going to have greater foreign ownership of the media industry in our country? Are we going to allow greater concentration of the media industry? Both sound like undesirable outcomes to me. But because the system has been set up in a dynamic, changing industry we have the government again caught flat-footed with its policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have recently&mdash;and it is still currently under inquiry&mdash;the ABC. The ABC has been shown to be moving in the range of new directions with very little external audit control. The ABC inquiry that is currently under way has revealed quite a lot of things that it will be reporting to the Senate on fairly soon. All this shows a minister who is very much just paddling around and not really keeping a hand on the department that he is the minister for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me back to the major problem we are now facing. This anti-siphoning list is a test for the minister. It is a pretty simple test. One fears for the future of the communications industry, the nature of which I have just described, if this minister cannot get this very simple situation right. Let me describe the nature of the task to show how simple the task initially was and how much of a muddle he has got it into. All he had to do was come up with an anti-siphoning list. These were products, programs, that people frequently watch&mdash;like the West Indies test cricket series. He had to put these things on a list. He produced a list but, like a lot of what this minister has done, the problem has arisen because what he did was far too late. He did not anticipate what was going to happen in a dynamic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was happening out in the dynamic market was that Australis, one of the main pay TV operators that operates Galaxy, had shot off with no regulatory regime in place&mdash;so there was nothing saying it could not do this&mdash;and decided it would buy the rights to this West Indies cricket series. It has done that; it has bought the rights. And then the minister comes out with a list, which more or less says you cannot buy the rights. He brought this list out months ago. Fairly obviously, the decision had to go one way or the other. Either he stuck by his list or he did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would wonder why it has taken five or six months for this minister to work out what his problem was and come up with some sort of solution. He has not come up with a solution. He started out taking the line that he would protect his anti-siphoning list. Then he went into some negotiations with Channel Nine and Galaxy and decided that Galaxy could have it 24 hours later. Then he decided that maybe 12 hours would be better. This is a classic case of policy on the run, of a minister again caught totally flat-footed in a dynamic, changing market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is going to be the outcome of all this? The outcome is, if Galaxy gets its way, that probably a few hundred people will watch the West Indies cricket series. Galaxy has on its books at the moment under 2,000 people for subscription television. That is in total. It is not 2,000 cricket fans&mdash;it is 2,000 viewers. They want to watch it live. There is one little brake on it. First of all, you have to be prepared to sit up between midnight and dawn to watch. That will cut a few of them out. The other thing is that the 2,000 are not all cricket fans. My guess is that probably about 200 or 300 people might watch this. Isn't that a disgrace? We have a nation of cricket lovers here and because of the government's incompetence in handling this fairly simple matter, we have to come to a point where a few hundred people might watch the game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has to come to a decision very quickly. He has to stop buck-passing. He has to make a decision. If he makes the wrong decision he has to explain to the West Indies why they are going to lose an enormous amount of money out of what he has to do. But the main thing is that the minister must keep his promise that viewers will not be forced to pay to watch the major sporting events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what anti-siphoning is all about. You should not be forced to pay for these particular events. Minister Lee and the ABA must settle this dispute between the parties so that the free to air and pay TV operators have very clear rules to abide by. What we have at the moment is the law of the jungle&mdash;will they do this or will they do that. They are out there brawling publicly about whether it will be winner take all or some sort of compromise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The free to air television channels involved in this matter are really digging in and I think they have good reason to dig in. They do not want this test case with Galaxy siphoning off, against the anti-siphoning list, a major event like the West Indies cricket series because they fear that if it succeeds it will happen with a lot of other major cricket series and other sporting events in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian television consumer is outraged by this outcome of ALP government incompetence. What the government must do as we count down to day 7, day 6 and day 5 is come up with a situation where this test actually gets to the majority of viewers. In other words, the government must come up with a situation where it sticks by its rules in the anti-siphoning legislation. That is the initial position the minister took. Now he has done a backflip and gone over to the pay TV operator side. If you make a set of rules you should stick by them. As I said earlier, I fear for not only the future of the pay television and television industry in this country but also the future of the whole communications industry in this country if they are guided by a totally inadequate legislative framework and a totally incompetent minister. </PARA>

<PARA>understand it because that is traditionally my position. What we are hearing from the opposition is that the market has failed and the government should step in and somehow or other direct Channel 9 to broadcast this test. What hypocrisy and humbug from the great free enterprise coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where Senator Tierney has indicated his extraordinary and amazing ignorance of this area of government policy. What we clearly have is a case where there has been a gross misrepresentation of the facts to the Senate. We have a clear case where one company, a pay TV company, purchased the rights to broadcast a test in the West Indies before the siphoning list was declared by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). The facts are that it purchased the rights to this test before the government acted. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the opposition's line of argument, the government is somehow or other supposed to retrospectively change the rules and say that the list that was declared on 31 May 1994 should be backdated to when the company bought the rights on 27 May. These are clearly matters that are subject to action before the Australian Broadcasting Authority. We as a parliament are presumably, if we follow the logic of the opposition's line of argument, supposed to say, `Blow all that. You must broadcast this test despite the fact that the laws did not come into effect, according to submissions put to the ABA, until three days after the purchase of these rights.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that Senator Tierney has information that I do not have. It may be the case that, in fact, the ABA has been misled. It may be that the minister has been misled. It may be that, in fact, the rights were purchased after the declaration of that anti-siphoning list. If that is the case, we have different circumstances altogether. But that is clearly not what the companies are saying at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABA has written to Australis Media asking it to put its case. Those opposite will recall, of course, that it was Australis Media that claimed to have the ownership of the rights. It was not pointed out to the ABA until 22 December 1994 that there had been the purchase of these rights by a junior company of Australis Media. When this matter came before the Senate select committee and the principals of Galaxy were asked about this, they explained, `Look, we are a very small company. We didn't really have all the infrastructure necessary to get our paperwork clear and right. What we had was our chief executive running around the world buying up shows wherever he could get them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now discover that the ABA is looking at the facts to establish whether or not these rights were purchased when the company claims they were purchased. We have then a motion before the Senate which, essentially, is based on that fundamental failing in logic. A proposition is being put to the Senate that somehow or other the minister has been involved in some sort of debacle, that he has had eight months to get this right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This simple proposition of the date on which these rights were bought is quite fundamental. We do not hear anything about it from the opposition. We hear a lot about flip-flopping, and I would like to hear a fair bit more about the flip-flopping opposition. I would like to hear, for instance, when the question of the anti-siphoning laws was debated. I would like to hear what its policy was. You never hear much about what the opposition policy really is but, occasionally, you get a glimpse of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, on 20 May 1994, an edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Australia</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Senator Richard Alston, also warned that ensuring wide-spread free-to-air access to sporting events could be to the detriment of the developing pay-tv industry.</PARA>
<PARA>He says it could be of detriment to the pay TV industry if we have an anti-siphoning regime. He said that it would be a travesty if the list was so far reaching that it undermined the viability of the fledgling pay TV industry. That is really at the nub of all of this, isn't it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is a case where the opposition wants the government to interfere in the commercial negotiations between the pay TV company and Channel 9. What you are expecting us to do is to say, `We'll pick the winner in terms of the arrangements that you enter into about the broadcast of the test series.' The government makes it very clear that it wants to see this test broadcast. It makes it very clear that Australis and the Nine Network have to reach an agreement and a sensible accommodation which would permit the free to air broadcast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the government has to recognise that the attitude of Channel 9, as expressed by David Leckie on the ABC and before the Senate select committee, was a disappointment. What he said was difficult to understand. `After all,' he said, `Channel 9 had met all the financial demands made upon it by Australis.' He said that the whole issue was a question of whether or not there be simultaneous broadcasting. What I find particularly odd is that Australis is able to reach agreements with the SBS over simultaneous broadcasting of the English FA Cup, with the ABC over simultaneous broadcasting of the netball world championship and, I understand, also with Nine over the US Masters golf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose there might be some debate about what simultaneous means in those circumstances. It was suggested by Channel 9 that simultaneous could, in fact, mean a delay of one minute. All of these things strike me as particularly odd. If there were a bit more goodwill around these issues, I do not see why there could not be an agreement reached in the case of the cricket. What strikes me as particularly interesting is the history of this matter in regard, for instance, to the New Zealand cricket test&mdash;where again we saw all this fracas. Of course, just before crunch time we saw a settlement. What we have here is two companies engaged in commercial negotiations: a free to air service company with a very large audience and a pay TV company with, I think, 3,000 subscribers.

It also says that if they fail to do that there are mechanisms to reduce the size of that list. So it is an incentive for them as Channel 9 or the free to air service broadcaster, whoever it might be, to somehow make sure they make an agreement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion addresses one of the burning questions of the moment: will sports fans get to see the test cricket series between Australia and the West Indies when it starts in a week's time? The clock is ticking and there is a time bomb attached to it. If this impasse between Nine and Australis is not resolved satisfactorily, there will be a lot of angry sports fans out there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has stepped in now with a timely motion which seeks to lay the blame entirely at the feet of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), and there is no doubt that the minister must take a large slice of the responsibility for what has gone wrong. We warned him last year that there were problems which needed to be rectified, but very little has been done to address those. It is quite clear that the licence conditions in the act invite the sort of manipulation which the Nine Network now appears to be indulging in. I have to ask whether the Australian Broadcasting Authority has dealt with this dispute in an even-handed manner. It seems to us that the early signals sent to Nine encouraged it to play hard ball on this. The government has now changed its position, which has created an impression of indecision all around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is not the only culprit. The Nine Network has taken a very boots-and-all approach, which makes one wonder who its public relations advisers are. Prime International and Australis Media have done their bit by giving out conflicting information about exactly who acquired the rights and when they acquired them. Having considered the evidence given to last Thursday's committee hearing on this issue, we have come to the view that the solution to this problem lies in the hands of the Nine Network. We can see no justification for Nine's insistence on an exclusive live broadcast. It was never envisaged that the free to air broadcasters would use the act to degrade coverage on pay television, but that is what has happened in this case, or potentially is about to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The available evidence is that Nine actually knocked back the rights in May of last year, having been offered them by Trans World International acting for the West Indies Cricket Board of Control. The board appears to have been insisting on more money than it got from Nine in 1991 to avoid making a large loss on the tour, as happened in that year. Nine, according to Trans World International, said no. Australis then stepped in and said yes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There appears to have been prior discussion between TWI and Australis, and this may well have influenced the asking price which Nine knocked back. Nine then sought to use its anti-siphoning privileges to obtain the free to air rights at a lower price than the price knocked back originally. Going by some press reports, the price that has been offered may be lower than it paid in 1991. Given that it did knock back the rights that first time, you have to ask yourself how serious Nine was about screening the tour in the first place. Did it decide that it was not a priority at that price given the lack of interest in the 1991 tour, even though it could have cut its costs by on-selling those rights to pay TV? Did it only change its mind when it found it would be screened on pay television? They are interesting questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving them aside, we now have a situation where Nine could buy the rights at a reasonable price and show the series now. It has so far refused to do so unless it gets exclusive rights to the entire series on the ground. We do not believe that that is reasonable. Live broadcasts on pay television should not be a threat to Nine's revenue base or anyone else's. If they were to make a small but significant impact in the longer run, the price of free to air rights would adjust to reflect that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nine has argued that to allow live broadcasts on pay TV is like asking it to accept simultaneous broadcasts on Channel 7. That completely ignores the fact that Australis, unlike Seven, is not a free service. Nine has a strong cost advantage. It has no basis for demanding exclusive live coverage. That is where the minister has only belatedly got it right. He should have come to this position much earlier. It should have been the message last year, not this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened to the other networks? Why have they not bought rights to the series? We appear to be seeing a very convenient agreement at work here which is giving Nine a very large negotiating advantage. It is high time that the Trade Practices Commission took a long hard look at the reluctance of other networks to get involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion calls on the minister to act. But he appears to be running out of options. The only hope is that Nine will finally see reason or that another network will buck that system and take the broadcast. The minister can pile on the pressure, but he cannot do much else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He could have unravelled this mess much earlier. Had he accepted our suggestion late last year to allow pay TV licensees to buy pay rights to listed events, Nine would have had no way of enforcing a demand for exclusive live rights overall. It would have had to play with a straight bat. That is no longer an option because time is running out. But the Broadcasting Services Act must be amended to prevent this from happening again. A change to the licence conditions to allow the independent purchase of pay TV rights would certainly help. But there needs to be safeguards against the risk that Prime or Australis, for example, would then refuse to on-sell free to air rights to listed events at a realistic price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are proposing that the minister establish an arbitration system to handle claims by the free to air networks that this is happening. We believe that the ABA and the TPC should both be involved. If they determine that an unfair asking price is being asked, the minister should have the power to prevent pay TV from screening the event in</PARA>
<PARA>question. But, in the meantime, we can only say again that Nine or, failing it, any other free to air network should take the rights as offered and screen the series. If they deny the public this event, they will all seriously undermine the very privileges they now enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pay television is here to stay. It is time that we all learned to live with it. However, I am sure that Nine would have come to an accommodation had the pay TV licensee been Optus Vision instead of Australis. I wonder whether its tactics have as much to do with buying time for Optus Vision as protecting its free to air interests. I am sure that we will face real problems with siphoning once Optus Vision is up and running. We should fix them right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the motion makes some very valid points but that it has two main weaknesses. Firstly, it reads as though the series has already started. It is premature to say that the minister has failed because a final judgment is yet to be passed. Secondly, it lacks the courage to criticise the bloody-mindedness of some networks, especially Nine. There is more than one cook spoiling this broth. </PARA>

I was very pleased to see the new champion of free enterprise, Senator Carr, who I have never heard in quite such a vein before, getting very excited about this prospect of free enterprise. He is about the only one who is getting excited in Australia. Not too many cricket fans are getting excited. All they see is the prospect of the West Indies cricket tour taking place and their being unable to watch any of it on television.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I think of the current impasse, it is interesting to note that Senator Murphy and Senator Sherry are here. Unless this is resolved, they will not have a chance to see it, because pay TV will not be reaching Tasmania for some time. We have one of those rare occasions when we have two Tasmanians in the cricket side to go to the West Indies. I am quite sure that Tasmanians everywhere will be very disappointed if this impasse is not resolved and they do not get the chance to see David Boon and Ricky Ponting in action. Senator Denman is here as well. I am sorry that I missed her. We already have half of Tasmania here. Senator Calvert is in the chair. I had no idea that there were so many Tasmanians here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that we have reached such an impasse is not that the market has failed; it is that the minister has failed. The minister has failed to provide Australians with the opportunity. Anti-siphoning is the minister's idea. It is the minister's own creation. The fact that these events were not on the list&mdash;the list came out too late&mdash;is not the fault of anybody else but the government and the minister. If that list was in place at the right time, we would not find ourselves in the current impasse where it appears as though nobody will be able to get live coverage of that test tour in the West Indies. That tour has now become one of the most popular throughout the cricketing world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a fact that the market has got things wrong. It is a fact that the government has got things wrong due to its own mismanagement. It promised Australians that there would be free to air coverage of all of those major sporting events which were on that list. We understand the difficulties facing the West Indies Cricket Board of Control. A letter and a submission to a committee here last Friday from the West Indies Cricket Board of Control is a pretty unusual measure. You do not very often see somebody from outside Australia putting in a submission to a committee which is having a public hearing on legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board stated quite clearly that if this area of the world, which is not very wealthy and which relies heavily on this sporting event to provide it with income by way of television rights, does not get these television rights and the dollars that it expects to come from it, it will find it very difficult to survive through this tour. It runs at a loss of about half a million dollars with every tour because of the economic conditions within those areas. It is only television rights&mdash;whether they be from Australia or the United Kingdom&mdash;that make these visits to the West Indies by touring teams profitable events. That money helps those young people who are less privileged than those in Australia to be able to start out in sporting careers. Without it they would not be able to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the low income earners in Australia? Now that we know that Senator Carr is a champion of free enterprise, it looks as though we are the only ones that will try to make sure that something happens for the low income earners who rely entirely on free to air television to be able to provide them with the sporting coverage that they are entitled to get and which was promised to them by this government. If we reach the situation that currently exists where only some 2,000-odd people will be hooked up to pay TV and able to watch it through Galaxy&mdash;I guess if it is going to be on from midnight till seven in the morning you will probably be lucky if 200 of those 2,000 will watch the cricket all through the night&mdash;it is a very small percentage of Australians who will have any opportunity to watch this unless something is done very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard senators opposite say, `Yes, but we're acting as though the event has already started.' All we are doing is alerting you to the fact that, unless something is done very quickly, people will not be able to see it. It is a very short time before the first match is due to be telecast. It is a great pity that we have got to this stage where, in the week prior to this major event starting, we still do not know whether the events will be telecast. On current indications they will not be. A couple of weeks ago the minister supported the Nine Network's position that only it should have live television coverage. Now the minister is on the other side of the fence. He is adopting the position of the pay operator, Australis, which wants live coverage. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is no sensible reason why the majority of Australians cannot see this cricket, except that there is dispute between two companies and it is totally commercial.

I think that is a contradiction of your policy; that is, if you have a policy about anything, but it is a direct contradiction of your policy about free enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing in the government's policy that prevents the showing of the series. I know Senator Carr has made these points already but I am going to make them again because it seems as though it takes a long time for them to sink in for those on the other side of the chamber. This matter involves the commercial decision of broadcasters; it is not the government's decision.

<PARA>Obviously, you have not read it. It talks about the crisis which is before Australian viewers at this time. It is not good enough for government senators to stand up in here just seven or eight days before the start of the series and say, `I believe this matter will be resolved.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr came in here and demanded to know our policy. We very strongly supported the television anti-siphoning provisions. That is where the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) has failed. He has not delivered on his own policy. That is why we have the situation which we have now. It is going to spread far beyond Tasmania, which was mentioned. It is going to spread beyond those people who cannot afford pay TV. It is going to spread into the outback of this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the importance of this particular motion and the fact that it is highlighting this situation, we hear people on the other side saying that there are far more important things for us to be dealing with.

But, certainly, communications and recreation opportunities that Australians get through watching events of this nature are also very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chamber is the proper place to highlight the incompetence and lack of action that has occurred and the changing of the particular positions. We have here the product of a failed policy position and activity by a minister of the current government; that is the problem that we have. As I said earlier on, had this issue not be raised by the likes of Senator Tierney and others on this side the chamber, it could well have dragged on only for us to find in a week or so that we had no broadcasting of cricket. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do want to add some words to those which have already been said. I think Senator Tierney, Senator Ferguson and Senator Crane should be congratulated for wanting to get the Australia and West Indies cricket series televised out here. Indeed, that is no doubt what everybody would want. But the interesting thing about the motion is that those opposite condemn the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) for not doing something about it. If we look at item (d) in Senator Tierney's motion, it says that it:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . calls on the Minister to stop his monumental buck-passing and accept that he, as Minister, and not the television networks, is wholly responsible for this West Indies cricket coverage fiasco . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose we on this side must make something of this motion. I think the only thing that can come from this motion is this: that three very senior members of the coalition have brought this motion forward, and they blame the government and the minister for not making available the cricket from the West Indies when it is played. The only thing we can deduce from that is that it must be the policy of those opposite that the government must ensure that this happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose we on this side would not make the same deduction because, as is clearly apparent from this, we will not, as it were, force Channel 9 or pay TV stations to take certain action. But it would seem that the only way we could get the cricket to be shown out here is to force these stations to broadcast it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose what comes from that is&mdash;I should imagine there would be some sympathy for this around the country&mdash;that, if the coalition were in government, it would pass laws forcing Channel 9 to program the cricket. Perhaps Senator Tierney could confirm or deny that at the end of my short address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem to me that the only way the government could ensure the cricket was made available would be for it to take over&mdash;commandeer and nationalise&mdash;the pay TV stations and make sure it gets the cricket out to Australia. I am sure Senator Sherry would agree with me that in the motion it is not the station that the opposition says should be condemned; it says that the government must do these things. The whole thrust behind this motion is that government is responsible for getting cricket here. The only way it would seem open for that to happen is if the government were to take over the station&mdash;I suppose only for the duration of the test cricket and for the duration of the games being played. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you believe that that approach of taking over a particular station&mdash;Channel 9 in this case, or a pay TV station, depending on which one you want to broadcast on&mdash;is reasonable, then you can say that the minister is passing the buck by putting it on to the station. If I understand the thrust of this motion, the opposition is saying that the minister should ensure that the station does what the opposition says it should be doing. It thinks the minister should march in there and tell Channel 9, Channel 7 or Channel 10 what to do about things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the chamber say that ownership should be respected; that there should be freedom of expression; that television owners should have the right to be able to program their particular day in the way they choose, subject, of course, to the laws that protect people against pornography and things like that. But this suggestion made by Senator Tierney&mdash;a very responsible person, as we all know&mdash;that it is not a matter of banning things but a matter of, in a positive way, making stations show particular programs is an interesting extension of the sort of philosophy that has been put in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The select committee into pay television, of which I believe he is a member, seems to be a very interesting committee. It is interesting to note the initiatives that have been taken apparently by the committee and by Senator Tierney, who I think heads that committee. I might be wrong about that, but I believe that is the case. He certainly shows a lot of interest in it if he is not. Whether he is head of the committee or not, it is interesting to note his initiative of suggesting that government take over private stations. If the television stations cannot do it, perhaps you ought to take over a radio station, Senator Tierney. Perhaps you can explain that when you give your answer in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I can speak on behalf of the government&mdash;as I said, I am not a member of the government; I am a member of the government party&mdash;and say that the government will not be taking over television stations and the companies that own them and forcing them to show particular programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the opposition's position, I can understand why it uses the terms it does in this particular motion&mdash;why it condemns the government; why it says that there has been monumental buck passing; why it says that the government is wholly responsible and that the television networks are in no way responsible; and why it says that this is a coverage fiasco and that the minister is incompetent. But if, on the other hand, those opposite took the minister's approach&mdash;I simply ask them to put themselves in that position for a minute for the purposes of this exercise&mdash;and said that he is not and should not be obliged to take over television stations, they would perhaps see that their motion is a little harsh on him. Minister Lee is a person who respects the rights of property, and he respects the right of media people to run their own ship. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Schacht very much for his contribution. Senator Carr went on to make a number of rather silly points relating to this matter. He kept saying, and a number of government members have repeated these refrains, that `this will be solved', `we can still fix it' and `I have confidence that it still can be fixed.' I believe Senator Bourne of the Australians Democrats has a similar view. I call on particularly Senator Bourne to consider the fact that there are seven more days to this test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have obvious evidence from both Australis, which operates Galaxy, and Channel 9 that they are digging in on their position. We have a very even-handed minister handling all this. He first supported Channel 9. He did that for about eight or nine days. Then he decided he would support Galaxy. So that is being very even-handed. Then he had a shot at supporting the free to air networks, and then he had a shot at supporting the pay TV people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we wish the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) would do is support the cricket fans of Australia. He can support the cricket fans of Australia by allowing cricket games to be seen on free to air television. It should not be too hard for the minister to do that because that is the government policy. All we are asking the minister to do is resolve this in the way in which it was intended to be resolved: people with low incomes having the opportunity to see important games&mdash;games that have wide coverage, games that are watched&mdash;without having to pay for that right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we support the government's policy on anti-siphoning. We think it is a great policy. We believe a lot of the important sporting events in Australia should be left on free to air television. We are just calling on the minister to implement his own policy. I have great fears for the communications industry in this country&mdash;it is one of the great growth sectors of the future&mdash;because this is the tip of the iceberg that shows that this minister cannot run the very complex communications department if he cannot get the cricket scores right. </PARA>

The Thai communities, including extensive grassroots organisations such as the Buddhist development networks, are also threatened by the intrusion of transnational influence, and the astronomically growing power of economic elites in their own nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relocation of villages at gunpoint is also known in Thailand and, in spite of laws and principles on deforestation, Thailand's active environment movement fights clearing of so-called degraded forest for use as blue-gum plantation feeding the Japanese pulp industry, and clearing even of areas like the last indigenous pine forests near Chang Mai, having three unique Thai species. This was heavily protested by environmentalists, and the local Karen and Lanna-Thai population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 14 we see a mention of a visit to the Mae Moh lignite mine, a project supported by AIDAB and feeding directly into the neighbouring power station. A few references give clues to the cognoscenti who know that the Mae Moh power plant has been a running environmental disaster, polluting the air and water to an extent where the communities that were worse affected raised the issue through extremely militant civil action. I leave to your imagination what is referred to with the phrase, `water supply and environmental problems and their solutions', and the implications of the phrase, `relocation of villages'. Is this an example of our `clean coal' technology?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is most distressing is that, while the dams in Laos are briefly mentioned, more attention being given to the state of the Chancery building, the sentence in paragraph 131 on page 23 seems to imply that the delegation not only was not willing to report on some of the social or environmental implications of the dams, but instead seemed to be presenting the dams as an opportunity for Australian business. Indeed, they are, and several Australian businesses are already involved. One wonders how that fits into a code of conduct for businesses in South-East Asia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on this report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women, elections and parliament</EMPHASIS> with regard to the progress that is being made in identifying and encouraging women to stand for parliament. I noted with interest what I suppose is an official response in this month's committee bulletin which referred to the `SNAP decision', the decision made by the SNAPs, the sensitive new age politicians on the hill. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps this indicates what's to come&mdash;quick, understandable responses to speed up equality in the House.</PARA>
<PARA>In so far as the committee recommended that the minister authorises the committee to monitor developments in the area of participation by women in the electoral process and to report on this matter from time to time, I do not regard that as a quick moving response. The coalition would perhaps have liked a more positive report. In looking at the numbers of women in politics the first thing to be said is that, if we are serious about the goal of getting more women in parliament, we will need to work a great deal harder than we do at present. The number of women in parliament has been increasing but it would be hard to call the response brilliant. At present I think we are in a holding pattern, and that probably goes for all parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of factors work against greater numbers of women entering politics. In part, the low number of female politicians is linked with women's lower economic standing and over-representation in lower socio-economic groups generally. There are logistical constraints associated with women's family responsibilities and the demands of a parliamentary career, particularly in federal politics. It is very hard to balance the rearing of small children with the long hours and frequent travel associated with a career in politics. Some women would see the confrontational style and atmosphere of male dominated parliaments and unsympathetic treatment of female parliamentarians by the media as a disincentive to run for parliament, but probably some males find this a disincentive also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given these constraints, what strategies are in place or could be utilised to entice more women into the political arena? Should we change the system and make it more appealing to women, such as lessening the sitting hours, providing more travel allowance, and providing creches and tutors for the children of parliamentarians? Should we implement a quota system, as the ALP has done, and force parties to preselect a certain number of women in a given time frame? Should we try educating young women at school to be more aggressive and assertive so that the confrontationist style of federal parliament, or indeed state parliament, would not appear threatening? Should we encourage more women to stand for preselection and be more supportive of those who do, so that in time there will be so many to choose from that no-one could ever say, `But there were simply not enough women of substance to choose from'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment on the quota system implemented by the Labor Party. Labor's quota system, with an aim of 35 per cent female representation by the year 2002, has so far failed to jump the intransigent hurdle of factional dealings. Many seats that should have been given to women, had the party machinery been serious about selecting more women, turned into factional warfare with principles of gender equity lost in battle. </PARA>

Perhaps one of the most derisory examples of the way the ALP factional system works is the slipping down to an unwinnable third spot on the ALP's Western Australia ticket for a half Senate election.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quota has not proved popular in the electorate, as numerous statistics would attest to. A news poll in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 12 October revealed that nine in 10 people did not support a quota system, although a clear majority of them believed there should be more women in politics. At a Women in the Workplace Conference in Sydney in October, it was reported, again in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, that about 90 per cent of women present voted against quotas.

<PARA>The most recent ALP idea is to create a fund to woo women into parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By definition, political life will never appeal to everyone. I was interested to read a comment by Steve Vizard&mdash;a television personality in Melbourne&mdash;who, the media reported, was also approached to stand for the Victorian federal seat of Kooyong. He was somewhat stunned that he was approached to stand for that seat. He said he was interested in issue-driven politics and he was interested in party politics. He told the media and the people who suggested he enter politics that he was looking forward to leaving his family, his home, his beach house, his farm, his business and his life so he could go to Canberra&mdash;that international city of fun&mdash;and have journalists write demeaning articles about him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I have also found that many people in the community could not ever imagine themselves running for political office. To me, it is with a degree of sadness that I contemplate there is not a bigger pool of people from which to draw future parliamentarians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak on the report of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee to express my appreciation, and no doubt that of the members and participating members of the committee, for the extraordinary way in which the public and interested organisations responded at short notice to requests for submissions. I also want to place on the record my appreciation, and I am sure that of all other honourable senators who participated in the meetings of the committee, of the work of the staff in bringing together the various views that were placed before the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a number of complaints from a number of people that they did not have time made available to them to make submissions. That is one of the things that the Senate needs to give further consideration to in respect of the committees that are considering the various pieces of legislation that come before this chamber. It is unfortunate that so many organisations and people who are interested in and concerned with this legislation were unable to make submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, with very short notice we did get rather substantial submissions from a number of organisations. Those organisations are listed in an appendix on page 28 of the report. I think there was only one letter which actually supported the legislation. The submissions overwhelmingly opposed the legislation. The legislation which is the subject of this report is the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). The legislation has two operative sections. On page 1 of the majority report it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">clause 2</EMPHASIS> which contains the proposed subsections 36(3) and (4) will exclude certain persons who might otherwise possess membership of a `particular social groups' from claiming refugee status due to their membership of a `particular social group' based on the fertility control policies of any country. The proposed subsection 36(4) mentions the fertility control policies of the People's Republic of China (`PRC') as a specific example of a foreign government's fertility control policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Bill addresses the issue of a refugee applicant making repeat or multiple applications for refugee status.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not cover the matters in respect of the session. All those people who gave submissions and presented their case to the committee condemned this bill. Even the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees stated that the legislative approach was not the approach to adopt. He has since publicly branded the bill as unusual, unfortunate and without precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was denounced by the Law Council of Australia, Amnesty International, the Catholic Bishops of Australia, the Bar Association of New South Wales, prominent feminists, researchers Dr Renate Klein and Dr Lynette Dumble, FECCA, the Refugee Council of Australia and the Australian Law Reform Commission. Some excerpts of their opposition are to be found in the minority report that I have presented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report was signed only by the government members and, if you read between the lines, it is less than enthusiastic for the legislation. It is not for me to justify the majority report. There were dissenting reports by the opposition senators&mdash;Senator Ellison, Senator O'Chee and Senator Abetz. There was a further dissenting report from Senator Spindler and a dissenting report from me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, if enacted, would tarnish Australia's international reputation as a leading defender of human rights; would legislatively restrict Australia's obligations under the refugee convention in a manner likely to be injurious to the principle of non-refoulement, which is not handing back refugees to their persecutors; would be a confused and completely unnecessary response to a decision of the refugee tribunal as held by the Federal Court; and, most importantly, would send a message to the PRC government which it would interpret as condoning its fertility control policies involving forced abortions, coerced sterilisations, crippling fines, anti-worker penalties and other punishments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of fear has been engendered about the refugee situation. There is a lot of confusion that this is the same sort of bill as the No. 2 bill, which dealt with the Sino-Vietnamese situation. Let me make it perfectly clear that, in order to achieve refugee status, an asylum seeker must overcome two hurdles. The refugee convention requires that they must establish a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to their country. That fear must be on the ground of a convention&mdash;race, religion, nationality, political opinion or social group. If you cannot jump both hurdles, you are not accepted. Even if you can prove persecution, you are still not accepted unless that persecution is on the ground the convention grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are the fertility control policies of the PRC on the grounds of race? No. Colour? No. Race or religion? No. Nationality? No. Political opinion? No. They are against a particular social group, and that particular social group is defined by a consideration of how it is perceived by the rulers. That is the essence of the judgment of the independent Refugee Review Tribunal and the judgment of the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So you could have a situation where asylum seekers in Australia could have a real fear, a well-established and reasonable fear, that they are to face coerced abortion or sterilisation. They will not be able to jump that second hurdle if the government continues with the legislation and instructs the courts and the refugee tribunal to disregard the policies of the People's Republic of China in this matter. I appeal to senators to read this particular report thoroughly before they come to their conclusion, and I particularly ask the government senators to do just that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I appreciate your cooperation in giving me the opportunity to spend a few minutes addressing some remarks on the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995. I want to address some of the comments made by Senator Harradine, the speaker who preceded me in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine mentioned a timetable for submissions. I agree with him on that matter&mdash;and I suggest that it is probably one of the few matters in his comments that I do agree with&mdash;but I do think that, if legislation committees are going to work and work properly, more time has to be made available to take submissions and for the public to attend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular bill was referred to the committee, I believe, on the Tuesday when we first sat&mdash;I think it was 31 January. The committee met on the Friday, 3 February&mdash;a matter of a few days. It was not possible for me to beat up a bandwagon back in my own state of Western Australia in order to get submissions to the committee, but I am sure I could have matched the numbers that came in who were in opposition to the legislation, with perhaps a hundredfold of those constituents of my state who are exceptionally concerned about this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If my home telephone over the Christmas period is any indication of this, there is enormous concern in the community of Western Australia. My colleague Senator Panizza, who is sitting in the chamber, had cause to agree with me when I was addressing some remarks to this matter in the chamber some weeks ago. I think we do have to look at Friday committees and perhaps use this as an opportunity for the community to make comment on matters of high importance such as those that this legislation addresses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I want to comment on is the reference Senator Harradine made to the Australia-New Zealand South Pacific representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Pierre-Michel Fontaine, and some of the remarks that are reported in the media attributed to Mr Fontaine. Those remarks concern me greatly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fontaine gave evidence to the committee, and that evidence is in the record of the committee's deliberations. I have seen, since then, conflicting remarks attributed to Mr Fontaine that do not in any way match the comments that he, as the official representative of the UNHCR, gave to this Senate committee. I will give him the benefit of the doubt because from time to time the media in Australia does not get things right. As a matter of fact, at the National Immigration and Population Outlook Conference held by the Bureau of Immigration Research in Adelaide of last week, his comments were reported by two newspapers and the two reports conflicted. It just shows how far it can go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am making further investigations on the matter. I have sought a copy of his speech to that conference, and I will follow that through. I am concerned that a person of his stature, with such responsibility in Australia, has not corrected the record in relation to those conflicting remarks&mdash;maybe he has tried. The record I will stand with is that of the comments he directly gave to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the signing of the report. I am a signatory to the report of that under the signature of Senator Cooney, the chairman of the committee. I stand by everything that is said in that report. I agree with Senator Harradine in that some comments in the report may be seen by some as not all that complimentary of government action in this regard. Because I do not have the report in front of me, I refer to the use of ministerial discretion, which is something that we in government have to address in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very surprised when I received my copy of the report last evening to note that the dissenting report was signed by Senators Abetz, Ellison and O'Chee. I was amazed to find that Senator Short had not signed it. Senator Short is the opposition spokesperson on immigration. I fully expected him, as one of the leaders in his political party and indeed in the coalition, to attach his signature to the dissenting report. It is not as if Senator Short had not seen the dissenting report. On Tuesday evening during the legal and constitutional committee hearing on the Racial Hatred Bill, I sat beside Senator Short as he proofread and corrected the draft of the dissenting report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Senator Short has seen and made contributions to the report, but he has not put his signature to it. I wonder why that is the case. Perhaps it is to save him the embarrassment that he has gone through over the Migration Legislation Amendment (No. 3), which deals with compensation through legal action for persons unlawfully in Australia. Last year the Senate rejected that bill. The opposition, after opposing the bill last year, has done a huge backflip by supporting it on Tuesday of this week in the House of Representatives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) put out a press release in relation to the report that we are now debating; in particular in relation to the dissenting report by coalition senators, my colleagues Senator Ellison, Senator O'Chee and Senator Abetz. Senator Bolkus made several quite wild assertions in that statement. They are misleading, confused and inaccurate assertions and I will take this opportunity to refute them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I have refuted them in the form of a press release which I put out an hour or so ago. Given the content of Senator Bolkus's statement I could think of no more appropriate title for my press release than `Has Bolkus gone bonkers?' One would have to think that he has gone bonkers if one looks at his press release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His statement was prompted by the dissenting report by the coalition senators. He said that the coalition senators have opposed the bill. Wrong! The coalition senators have not opposed the bill. What my colleagues have said is that the bill has several major deficiencies and its consideration by the parliament should be deferred until the minister attempts to resolve those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister says that I expressed my support on 30 December 1994 for measures to present the undermining of Australia's refugee-humanitarian program and to protect our borders from illegal immigration. What I actually said was that whilst I welcomed the belated statement on that day about these matters from the minister, the coalition would&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">need to see the detail of the Government's proposed new legislation before taking a final decision on it. However, the Coalition agrees with the intent of the legislation and will take a sympathetic approach to it.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what I said on 30 December and that remains the case. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with the spirit of my 30 December statement the coalition supported the expeditious passage of Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 which provided for the return to China of the several hundred Sino-Vietnamese illegal boat people who arrived in Australia from around mid-November 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the bill that the Senate reported on yesterday is acknowledged by everyone, including the minister's own department, to be very seriously flawed. It has many flaws to it, as my colleagues on the Senate committee have so ably pointed out in their dissenting report. They were not alone in this criticism. This bill has attracted criticism from the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Law Reform Commission, the Catholic Bishops of Australia, the Bar Association of NSW, the Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia, Amnesty International, the Refugee Council of Australia and many other organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister also said in his press release today that he had already discussed with me amendments `which may clarify and give certainty to the legislation'. I raise two points about that. First of all, that was wrong. The fact is that, during the Senate committee hearings, there was general agreement not only by non-governmental witnesses but by the minister's own department that amendments would be required. Three hours after the minister made his statement, some amendments were faxed through. But at the time of making his statement, there had been no amendments. The minister had had no discussion at all with me about amendments, other than a passing conversation which I initiated with one of his advisers yesterday, saying, `Where on earth are the amendments that you know full well you need?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has been absolutely misleading, for whatever reason&mdash;and Senator McKiernan picked that up today and followed the same line, regrettably&mdash;in his interpretation of the whole situation. All I can say to the Senate is that this bill has many serious difficulties. It is not necessarily irretrievable but it does need some major amendments. We will be considering our final position with respect to the bill in the next few days, following the normal due processes. I find the assertions and allegations that have been made, both by the minister today and regrettably by Senator McKiernan, who is in the chamber, regrettable because they are so totally inaccurate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing that needs to be understood is that the evidence before the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee was overwhelmingly opposed to the legislation as it is currently drafted. For the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), Senator McKiernan and others to assert otherwise would be incorrect. The shadow minister, Senator Short, has indicated a number of organisations that oppose the legislation. It would be very helpful if we also heard from Sir Ronald Wilson, a former judge of the High Court of Australia and President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This is what he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coerced sterilisation or abortion is a flagrant disregard of a fundamental human right. In my submission, it is wrong for the Government to ask the Parliament and people of this country to condone the exclusion of asylum seekers from refugee status based on a well founded fear of that kind of persecution.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the committee heard evidence in camera from witnesses from China as to some of the barbaric procedures that are implemented in pursuit of the so-called fertility control policies. Some people, unfortunately, refer to them as one-child policies, but in certain areas of the People's Republic of China, if you do not have a licence to have a child, you are not allowed to have one. That is then enforced by compulsion in certain areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government wants to go on public record as a fighter for human rights and give credence to that sort of behaviour by the People's Republic of China, let it do so, but let it do so openly, honestly and without the sort of obfuscation that the minister tried to engaged in during the debate today. His scandalous press release was clearly incorrect. He asserted that he spoke to the shadow minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, which he clearly has not done. Clearly, the government is realising that it is in a very difficult position; it cannot get out, so what does it do? The best form of defence is to attack, so it sought to attack Senator Jim Short in a press release and also in this parliament just a few moments ago. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Herron</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I write in response to your Committee's Inquiry into the Validation of CAM and SAM Funding of Nursing Homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to emphasise the considerable importance this Government places on the nursing home validation program. The validation program is an accountability program which helps protect frail elderly nursing home residents by checking that funds allocated to nursing homes to care for their residents is actually spent on residents' care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reference was initially made to the Committee by the Senate on 30 September 1993. In December 1993 the Committee sought comments on the Terms of reference from all nursing homes. There were public hearings in June 1994, and the Committee tabled its report on 16 November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to note that after such a comprehensive canvassing of all nursing homes, the Committee's report did not find major systemic problems with the validation program. The report usefully identified some areas where we can improve our administration of the program, and I welcome those recommendations which focus on the need for more timely processes (recommendation 1), more training (recommendations 2 and 3), clearer and simpler information, and consultation and training for nursing home proprietors and staff (recommendations 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to be able to report that considerable work is being undertaken in each of these areas, for example:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The Department has asked the Australian Law Reform Commission to help redraft legislation to make it simpler and clearer;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Government initiated a major consultation of nursing home accountability and regulations, chaired by Sir William Keys. Within a fortnight of becoming Minister, I approved all of his recommendations;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Department is committed to improving timeliness of the validation process&mdash;all of 1986-87 validations are completed and more than 70% of 1987-88 are completed. A risk management approach will be adopted in the validation program, which will enhance the timeliness of the process and enable the program to be brought up to date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.currently a major consultancy is underway to improve the information the Department sends to nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to both the protection of frail aged residents of nursing homes and to a streamlined and efficient administration and regulation system. In responding to the Committee's report the Government is concerned to maintain that balance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is on this basis that the Government cannot agree to recommendation 6 of the majority report. Professor Gregory's first report on the structure of nursing home funding noted that option 2 would minimise flexibility and profitability for nursing homes. I should make clear however that following Professor Gregory's second report, the Government is considering more relevant changes to nursing home funding arrangements. I note that a Dissenting Report by four of the eight Committee members disagrees with the majority report recommendation number 6 while supporting all of the other recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's response to each of the recommendations is attached. I will be tabling this letter in Parliament in the week commencing 27 February 1995 as the Government's response to the References Committee's report.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key component in completing outstanding validations will be the successful adoption of a risk management approach to scheduling and conducting validations. This initiative is part of the recently introduced quality assurance strategy in the nursing home program. A risk management approach to validation started in October 1994. This approach still means that all nursing homes are subject to validation, but it means homes most at risk of not spending care funds on residents' care will be visited earlier and more frequently, and that all financial records may not be validated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The resulting schedule is a rolling program of validation visits based on homes' performance against a range of factors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department is unable to give a detailed schedule of the program for completing outstanding validations as the validation program will now be constructed to deal progressively with homes which indicate the highest level of risk against a range of indicators. As one of these indicators is length of time since last validated then homes not validated for earlier years are likely to be visited first.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the beginning of 1994-95, there were 5000 outstanding validations. The Department proposes a risk management strategy based on validation of 75% of outstanding home-years on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, some 3500 of the outstanding years are likely to be validated. The department will have a capacity to perform at least 1500 validations a year which would see the program brought up to date, within existing legislative parameters, by the end of 1996/97. This enables validation responsibilities to be met under the new benefit payment scheme, effective from 1 July 1993, which requires a fee to be set within three years of the end of the year of funding.</PARA>

This will be available for use by Departmental staff and the nursing home industry in March 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other measures which will maximise consistency include regular management and staff conferences and improved management information systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures will ensure staff are able to provide clear statements of requirements to nursing home proprietors. Validators will for example provide improved information to new proprietors, facilitate industry information seminars, implement a nationally consistent validation methodology for all homes based on risk management and improve communication with homes on the validation process.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has considered carefully the recommendation and views of both the majority and the minority report. It is the Government's view that the advantages of the majority report recommendation are countered by the disadvantages. In particular: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.importantly, as was noted by both the majority and the minority reports, the proposed system would reduce safeguards for residents' care;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.most homes use contract services, the cost of which would have to be divided into labour and non-labour components. This would require the Government to validate both labour and non-labour costs incurred by contractors, as well as labour costs incurred by nursing home proprietors. Currently only labour costs incurred by proprietors need to be validated. Therefore as well as simplifying some aspects this would also add complexity;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.while the proposed system would make it easier for nursing homes to use staff part-time on SAM (infrastructure funding including profit) and part-time on CAM (care funding), it would make it harder to share SAM staff between the nursing home and an attached hostel or other care facility;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.as was noted in the majority report the proposed system would actually reduce the incentives for efficiency, since efficiency savings in labour, a large component of SAM, would reduce profitability; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the change would require that the amount of SAM be split into SAM labour and SAM non-labour, in a situation where the Government is unlikely to have reliable information  on which to base the split, and where a "wrong" decision could substantially affect the viability of many homes. Even a "correct" decision would cause considerable disruption, since it would provide significantly less funding than many homes currently use for non-labour costs, and significantly more than many other homes use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not therefore propose to adopt the recommendation of the majority report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the government's response to the report of the Senate's Community Affairs References Committee on the validation of CAM and SAM funding to nursing homes. Validation has been a problem for a long time. The validation process, particularly the delays on the part of the Department of Human Services and Health, have been criticised by all sectors of the nursing home industry&mdash;proprietors and their industry representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has raised concerns about this issue on numerous occasions. I have spoken about it many times in this chamber. The Auditor-General has tabled a damning report on validations, highlighting some of the systematic problems in this validation process. When it was obvious that the situation was reaching crisis point and the government was doing nothing to rectify the situation, the coalition moved a motion to have the validation of CAM and SAM funding of nursing homes referred to a Senate committee for inquiry. That was on 30 September 1993. The report of that committee was tabled on 16 November 1994. Today we are discussing the government's response to that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout all this period, the Department of Human Services and Health continued to be criticised for delays in the validation process. Even after the department realised in 1990 that there was an urgent need to speed up the validation process, it took another four years for all the 1986-87 data to be processed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her response, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) emphasises the importance of validation as an accountability program which helps protect frail elderly nursing home residents by checking the funds allocated to nursing homes to care for residents and to make sure that they are actually spent on the care of those residents. This view is supported by the Auditor-General and is a view with which the coalition concurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I deal with the government's response to each recommendation, I would like to say that the minister misrepresents the situation when she says in her covering letter to the report that `all of the 1986-87 validations are completed'. I believe that that statement is not correct. When the Auditor-General brought out his report, it indicated that a number of the validations for that period had not been completed. In addition, in estimates committees only a few weeks ago, we asked the department again. We did not get an absolutely clear answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that the validations have been done&mdash;that is, the validators have been there&mdash;but I am not absolutely sure whether all the exit interviews have been done and all the nursing homes have been told whether they owe money as a result of that validation process. I am sure that Senator Woods will speak about a number of cases which he has been alerted to where that process has not been completed. I would like the minister to be more clear when she addresses this issue. If she wants to say that the 1986-87 validations have been completed in the sense that the validators have been into the nursing homes, that is fine; let her say that. But if she means that they have been completed in the sense that all the nursing homes know exactly where they stand in terms of the amount of money they owe for that period, there is some doubt about that. I would really like to see it clarified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended that the Department of Human Services and Health provide a detailed schedule to the committee outlining its proposed program for completing outstanding validations. The government has admitted that it is unacceptable that there should be such delays in the validation process and that to complete the outstanding validations&mdash;there were 5,000 of them at the beginning of 1994-95&mdash;it will adopt a risk management approach to scheduling and conducting validations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not before time. One can only ask why it has taken a Senate committee report for the government to accept responsibility for the debacle of this area of administration and to take some action to rectify it. It is just ridiculous to expect that a business should have to wait for years before it knows whether it owes money to the department. It impinges on how it engages in financial planning. Another problem with validations is that nursing homes could be repeating the same mistake, some of them unwittingly and some, albeit few of them, wittingly. Some of them were repeating the error. If they were not validated, they could continue to do that for ensuing years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another two recommendations of the committee are that the Department of Human Services and Health improve its training program for validators to ensure an optimum level of consistency in the validation process and that the validators should have formal accountancy qualifications or other appropriate training. The government's response is that it agrees in principle that the validators should have training. In 1992-93, only 50 per cent of the validators had appropriate formal training. In 1994-95, 60 per cent of people have formal qualifications. It is obvious to me and some of my colleagues on this side of the chamber that there are problems in the area of training and the qualifications of validators. It has taken endless criticism, a Senate inquiry and a critical Auditor-General report before the government would even listen, let alone take any action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation made was that the Department of Human Services and Health publish a document, expunged of confidential internal departmental information, that would provide guidance to nursing homes on the validation process, that this should be widely distributed and should form the basis of validations for that year. So the document is issued and then you would refer to the validations for that year in the relevant document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was happening was that the goalposts kept changing. There were guidelines and the nursing homes carried out their business on the basis of those guidelines. Then, when the department got a bit more experience with the system, it changed the guidelines and validated the back years on the basis of the new guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot actually do that. That is unfair. The guidelines were not clear. I believe that many of the nursing homes were not fully informed. It may have been an error on their part, but the department could have been more pro-active in ensuring that the nursing homes were very clear about what constituted CAM activities and what constituted SAM activities. There were enormous complaints about that. Hopefully, there will be very clear directions and those problems will be overcome as a result of the government responding to that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other recommendations was that the government introduce a funding system for nursing homes based on a system of acquitting labour costs and providing a non-acquittable grant for non-labour costs based broadly on the system proposed in option 2 of the Gregory report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the structure of nursing home funding arrangements: stage 1.</EMPHASIS> Of course the government would not agree to this. There was a minority report. We argue that the government ought to take these recommendations into serious consideration. I ask the government to look at it again because I do not think that the minister's response is adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation was that the Department of Human Services and Health improve its consultative mechanisms within the industry in general, and in particular consult widely with the industry and industry organisations in the formulation of departmental circulars. This recommendation lies at the very heart of so many of the criticisms of the validation process. I am glad that the government has come to recognise this, even though it is very late in the day. A constant criticism on the part of proprietors and industry bodies has been the failure of the department to consult, the plethora of circulars and the lack of appropriate communication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation was that the Department of Human Services and Health in future distribute departmental circulars to both proprietors of nursing homes and to directors of nursing to improve the overall access to information&mdash;a very simple thing. If it had actually talked to the industry, it would have found out that this would have made things easier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the number of circulars, and given that nursing homes are busy looking after their residents rather than doing unnecessary administration, it is absolutely important for the director of nursing and for the management to have a copy of those circulars. It is going to do this in a form that is able to be put into loose-leaf folders so that the circulars can be kept in some sort of order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 9 was that the Department of Human Services and Health ensure that the NH20 form or documentation on the structure and format of the form is made available to nursing homes at least one month prior to the beginning of each financial year. Nursing homes were gathering data, then getting the form and having to try to make their data fit the form. There seemed to be no good reason given to us on the committee why that form could not be given out as the year began. The government has agreed to that. One of the other areas of recommendation was that there be more adequate training for nursing home staff. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee on CAM and SAM funding to nursing homes, and in particular as one of four signatories to the dissenting report disagreeing with the majority report recommendation 6, I have a few matters to raise. The dissenting report contains the crux of the reason why we as a government cannot agree to recommendation 6 of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is committed to both the protection of frail aged residents of nursing homes and to a streamlined and efficient administration and regulation system. The government is very concerned that this balance be maintained. It is imperative that the scales not fall to one side. It is a true balancing act that would be destroyed if recommendation 6 were adopted. I am happy to say it will not be, but in my view the recommendation should not have been made in the first place. It defied commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dissenting report is about achieving a balance. In the view of the government, together with Senator Lees, the status quo should remain subject to better and more relevant changes being made to nursing home funding that is more sophisticated and fairer than option 2 supported under recommendation 6. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Gregory's first report on the structure of nursing home funding noted that option 2 would minimise flexibility and profitability for nursing homes. It should be made clear to this chamber that, in response to Professor Gregory's second report, changes will be considered. But I can assure you that any changes that are mooted will not be at the expense of care as supported by the majority report. The reason the status quo should remain is that the current standards monitoring system would fail as a tool under option 2 to adequately ensure the same quality of care that now exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What higher purpose could be met but that the funding be directly linked to the care that is provided by nursing homes, but the opposition wants to put that at risk. The risk of adopting a funding system based on acquitting labour costs and providing a non-acquittable grant for non-labour costs based on option 2 of the Gregory report has in my view spoiled what was a very constructive and worthy report. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What also puzzles me is that the opposition is always harking on about incentives for efficiency in funding programs across a myriad of areas, yet recommendation 6 would actually reduce the incentives for efficiency since efficiency savings in labour, a large component of SAM, would reduce profitability. </PARA>

The one recommendation which has not been accepted is recommendation 6, which relates to our restructuring of the CAM-SAM system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very sad because this is recommended by the government's own report, the Gregory report, where there is a recognition of the structural difficulties that the CAM-SAM system imposes upon directors of nursing, staff and proprietors in the nursing home industry. It is an arbitrary definition which leads to excess bureaucracy, which leads to time wasting, which leads to red tape and essentially diverts resources and funds which can be better used for the care of patients in determining whether in fact a particular task falls on one side or other of the arbitrary CAM-SAM boundary.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the biggest wastes of time in the nursing home industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Denman has raised a question of care. To all of us care is paramount. On our side, we believe that the issue of care would be enhanced by removing the waste of resources utilised in adapting to a CAM-SAM boundary which changes whenever the government bureaucrats decide it should be changed. The goal posts are changed regularly, and that is entirely inappropriate and makes life very difficult for providers of care in the nursing home industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gregory's option would have created flexibility which would have meant that there would be a more efficient use of resources not only generally but in particular in terms of those small nursing homes where multiskilling is vitally important. It is crazy that an employee who takes food from the kitchen through to a patient somewhere along that journey changes from being a CAM funded employee to being a SAM funded employee. This is a particular problem for small nursing homes. The Gregory option which we supported would have increased efficiency, reduced bureaucracy and red tape, and would have led to a better caring environment for those residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The artificiality of a CAM-SAM structure is something which surely should be got rid of. I wonder why the commission's reports are ignored the way the Gregory reports are ignored by the government. What is the point in commissioning reports if they are then ignored? The SAM funding should be reviewed, as is recommended in the Gregory report, but the government has no initiative, no purpose in terms of improving the quality of care offered to residents in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the increase in funding recommended by Gregory should be put in place as a matter of urgency. Yet the government really ignores a whole raft of reports. There have been two Gregory reports, there is a report by the Auditor-General, a report by the Ombudsman, the Keys report, and every single one of these reports is critical of the government in one way or another. Yet the government still does not fix up the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolute debacle that the government allows a structure like this, an inefficient structure, to continue. The problem is that the people who pay the price for this inefficient structure are not the proprietors or the staff so much as the residents in the nursing homes. It is care that suffers because time and resources are wasted in terms of looking after the requirements of the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that care would suffer under a changed CAM-SAM system is entirely inappropriate. The inspection system in the nursing home industry is probably greater than any other single industry. That in itself would take care of the importance of caring for the residents in their system. There are state and Commonwealth inspection teams coming out of your ears. I have no doubt at all that the care aspect, vitally important to everybody in the industry, is vitally crucial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should point out that there are inaccuracies in the report. The point saying that validations from 1986-87 have been completed is absolutely wrong. There are a list of eight or nine nursing homes that I am aware of where the validations have not been completed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a jacket on. It was the insignia that I have proudly on my chest. I wear it as a badge of honour, and I am proud to be associated with CARE Australia. My security was the badge that I have on my chest and it saved me on many occasions. I was absolutely appalled to see the attack made on this wonderful organisation by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program and Channel 9 last Sunday. I want to refute some of those allegations because I have had time to find out what they were about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was held up in Rwanda itself with a gun pointed at me because a vehicle broke down. It was a vehicle that we had purchased from an east German manufacturer, and it is relevant to the allegations that were made on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. What were those allegations? The first allegation was that there was fraudulent behaviour and misrepresentation. Most of the  former employees who made allegations of this type were not in positions where they would know the full facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other cases, they were completely unaware of the difficulties of field operations of the type that were undertaken and those field operations were governed by strict rules. Organisations such as the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees governed those actions. There was another allegation that there was an attempt to bribe the President of Kenya. In several cases set out by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, the existence of contract arrangements and negotiated budgets was ignored, as were the cases of acquittal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who made those allegations on that program? There was one Julian Fidge. I have before me a document signed by my friends who were with me at the time, and I left a month earlier than they did, and he followed me on. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We the undersigned employees of CARE Australia approve of and appreciate the decision of management to remove Julian Fidge from its operations in Zaire. We feel that his behaviour was unpredictable, unsafe and showed an unwillingness to work as part of a team. We would be unwilling to continue our work in Zaire with him as part of our team.</PARA>
<PARA>He was there seven days and then Channel 9 got him to appear on its program as an authority&mdash;seven days in the Kitale camp. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same Mr Fidge took an action and his case was heard on 11 October 1993. He was dismissed as an employee of the Caulfield pharmacy. The judgment of the Employee Relations Commission was that the pharmacy was entitled not to re-employ him, and why not&mdash;because they found that he acted unprofessionally and out of his area of expertise as a pharmacist. He lost the case&mdash;the man that Channel 9 produced as its expert. After seven to 10 days&mdash;I think he was there some days in Nairobi and they redeployed him there&mdash;that is the man who is the expert for Channel 9. It does not say so much about Fidge himself, but it says a lot about Channel 9. These are the experts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another man who made allegations is a Mr Mitchell. Mitchell lied about a photograph that was fabricated. I am not sure who fabricated it but it was a fabricated photograph. It is a paste-up that can be seen when you analyse the material. Mitchell said in the document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the ten convoys that I took part in and delivered some 100 tonnes of aid it was taken where it was needed and I thank CARE for putting me in charge of doing it. I would like to return to work for CARE again.</PARA>
<PARA>He was the man who lied about that photograph. It is enormously difficult for aid organisations to screen people who ring them. When I rang, there were 2,000 calls coming in. CARE was in a desperate situation and had to accept people at face value. Another person who made an allegation on that program was Alma Lovecic. I have a letter before me from the Australian-Bosnian Herzegovinian Community Association that says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within Sydney's Bosnian community Ms Lovecic has a reputation as a self-centred personality who divided the community, always for the sake of importance of her personal role in the community. Not only has she divided the community but she managed to destroy some opportunities to gather large quantities of medicines and money for Bosnian civilians here locally.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the three experts. The other allegations were four years old and were investigated by AIDAB and found to be incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to another allegation; and that was in relation to the trucks. Funds raised through the pursuit program have helped tremendously in the expansion of the existing CARE non-government organisation dedicated trucking fleet. What happened was that the funds raised were insufficient to buy trucks. As I mentioned at the very beginning, it was an impossibility to ship trucks over. It was with the agreement of the board of governors that that money was spent on another purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Staff have no knowledge of auditing and accounting procedures. It is not their role. I have not the faintest idea. I was grateful for the provision of supplies in the area I was in and for the opportunity to deliver the care that we were trying to deliver to the thousands who came up every day. A group of six of us attended to between 800 and 1,200 people, as well as 1,200 children; 300 of them with dysentery, AIDS, diarrhoea, tuberculosis and everything else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I think I have demonstrated to you the fact that the witnesses Channel 9 relied upon were not witnesses of credibility. CARE Australia believes that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program was biased and unprofessional. The objections are that it gave inadequate opportunity for CARE to respond; it would not allow CARE to go live; it did not check its facts and it failed to become familiar with the business issues involved in aid delivery and negotiated contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to announce that CARE Australia is suing Channel 9&mdash;and I hope that it sues it to its boots; because that program has defamed one of the most wonderful organisations that exists in this community, an organisation that is overwhelmingly supported by Australians throughout the community. That program maligned the Australian director and a former Prime Minister. Anybody who could impugn the motives of Malcolm Fraser or Ian Harris, the Director of CARE Australia, deserves the utmost condemnation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that legal action is successful and I hope it will teach the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program the lesson that it must never do such a thing again because of the damage it does to all non-government organisations and aid organisations in Australia. I conclude my remarks by thanking CARE Australia for giving me the opportunity to take part in an event that has changed my life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight, I wish to raise the matter of Eastlink, which is a proposed high voltage powerline between the Gatton region west of Brisbane and the Armidale area in northern New South Wales. The powerline will be around 400 kilometres in length and is intended to be part of a national electricity grid connecting the power systems of the two states. The imminent construction of an enormous electric powerline, with the inherent consequence of enabling increased electricity consumption, is extremely relevant, given the current agonising of the federal government over how it is going to live up to its commitment to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Senators will probably be aware that I have placed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> proposed terms of reference for an inquiry into the Eastlink proposal. I have sent that to the Economics References Committee for consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Democrat senator for Queensland, I have received many expressions of great concern about various aspects of Eastlink. Australian Democrat members at the community level in these areas have also had many people approach them to voice their disquiet. These concerns have come from people all throughout the regions surrounding the corridor of the powerline in Queensland, from Gatton and Laidley to Allora, Warwick and Stanthorpe. Similar concerns have been expressed to me by residents over the border in places such as Armidale and many other small rural communities in the Eastlink path. As an example, one submission from residents of Boonah and the surrounding towns of Kalbar and Aratula detailed a wide variety of concerns about Eastlink. It contains over 1,200 signatures from people objecting to the powerline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate this week received petitions from over 2,000 people from areas such as those I have mentioned, all asking for a Senate inquiry. For the benefit of the Senate, I will outline some of the concerns expressed by those who have signed the petition. The petitioners point out that Eastlink is contrary to a recommendation of a 1992 report of the Senate's industry, science and technology committee. After the changes made by the Senate last year, this committee no longer exists and the area has been taken up by the Economics References Committee, which is why I proposed that the matter be considered by that committee. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly is, Senator Panizza. The people who signed the petition are also concerned that there have been no proper comparisons made of other options for meeting future energy needs or of the impacts on rural productivity, economic, environmental, health, development or lifestyle issues. The petitioners also voiced a widespread concern at the complete absence of any meaningful consultation. Unfortunately, Eastlink is not the only project in Queensland about which this could be said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps most disconcerting of all is the possibility that this powerline will be only the start. I have been informed that a Queensland Electricity Commission representative has told the deputy mayor of the Stanthorpe shire that a second line will be needed within five to 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Liberal Party member for Groom, Mr Bill Taylor, and the National Party member for Maranoa, Mr Bruce Scott, have also received many expressions of concern from their constituents, and they are supportive of this Senate inquiry. Mr Scott spoke on Eastlink in the other chamber earlier this week, as did Mr Taylor, and I understand that other coalition senators, Senator Boswell and Senator Herron, have been approached by concerned residents. My hope is that all senators from all parties will recognise the need for an inquiry at least. Concern from residents has been sufficient for the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Mr Borbidge, who is from the National Party, to state that under a coalition government there will be no Eastlink, and that any land acquired by the state government would be given back to the people at no cost to those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I welcome the concerns expressed by Queensland members of the coalition, it should be pointed out that it is a coalition government in New South Wales which is pushing for Eastlink to go ahead. So there is some conflict there. The Senate may also be interested to know that former Queensland Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen has come out strongly against Eastlink. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will have to ask Joh. I must say that I would have thought he would at least approve of the Goss government's consultation techniques, having pioneered some of those techniques during his own time in office. I will leave senators to judge for themselves whether Sir Joh's stance strengthens or hinders the credibility of such a viewpoint, but I am very pleased&mdash;and I give testimony here tonight&mdash;that, after living in Queensland for most of my life, I have found something about which Joh and I agree. Perhaps this is Blessed Mary MacKillop's second miracle. Anyway, I place that on record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is arguable that, given the right circumstances, sharing power, as in the Eastlink proposal, can reduce the need to duplicate power generation infrastructure. This can provide major savings in infrastructure costs and in reducing consumption rates of fossil fuels and levels of atmospheric pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions. It is, however, far from clear that Eastlink fits the bill in this regard, or that other possible alternatives to constructing the powerline have been fully explored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not convinced that adequate consideration has been given to all aspects of Eastlink; and, more importantly, those residents who will be directly affected are also far from</PARA>
<PARA>convinced. It is unfortunate that so often state governments do not give adequate consideration to the people they are meant to serve. As Eastlink covers two states, and is intended to be part of the national electricity grid, it is certainly appropriate for the Senate to examine the proposal. I hope that when my motion comes before the Senate next Wednesday all senators will join the Democrats in giving their support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) surprised us all with a sudden burst of integrity that enabled him to repudiate and condemn the dishonest election tactics of the Australian Labor Party relating to preferences for independent candidates in the recent Australian Capital Territory election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While still imbued with this unusual, but politically convenient, spirit of integrity, the Prime Minister might also repudiate the dishonest and devious device used to protect his then half owned piggery company from prosecution for polluting the upper reaches of the Scone water supply in August 1993, as I outlined earlier today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is astonishing that Mr Keating has not, at any stage, apologised for, expressed any regret over or expressed any condemnation or mild criticism of the actions of his piggery group while he was its half owner. All he has said is, `Look, I was not in charge of running it. It is basically not my fault.' There was not one word of apology; not one word of condemnation; and not even mild criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actions of this company, while he half owned it, ranged from multiple breaches of the Australian Securities Commission's recommendations relating to its reporting rules to continual breaches of anti-pollution laws. I now ask Mr Keating&mdash;I know it is a waste of time, but I nonetheless do it&mdash;whether or not he supports the dishonest conspiracy his piggery group entered into with the Danish multinational company that has enabled him to escape the ignominy of his half owned company being found guilty of a pollution offence. As I said earlier today&mdash;I did not get a chance to complete it&mdash;the report of the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority revealed that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . on the morning of the court case. . . Brown and Hatton&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that was Mr Keating's half owned company&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">lawyers told the EPA that Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd had transferred the piggery and its assets to Hunter Valley Piggeries in May 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transfer has never been lodged with the Land Titles Office.</PARA>
<PARA>The EPA release then went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prosecution could be brought only against the company which operated the piggery at the time of the pollution incidents on site. Since this was not Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>despite the fact that this was the only name on the register&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the charges could not proceed.</PARA>
<PARA>I might add that not only was that the name on the register, but also payments to contractors working in the piggery had been provided by the Brown and Hatton Group&mdash;that is, of those contractors who were paid on time. Applications to expand which were made to the local council developmental authority were also in that name. In none of the activities&mdash;for example, before the New South Wales government commission of inquiry into proposed expansion, payments to contractors or development applications&mdash;was the name `Hunter Valley Piggery Pty Ltd' ever used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Shepherd from the EPA said that part of the reason legal action was commenced was to ensure that the environmental performance of the existing piggery was upgraded, particularly with regard to waste water treatment and effluent irrigation. No wonder it needed to be upgraded because the piggery itself had admitted in front of the  commission of inquiry that there were frequent breaches of the pollution laws as the arrangements were inadequate. Dr Shepherd went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will now be issuing legal notices to require the operators of the piggery to carry out these improvements designed to protect the local environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current operator can expect that our requirements will be precisely defined and the time frame for compliance will be closely monitored . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legal action will be considered if any pollution incidents are detected in future. Given recent events at the site, we would not exclude legal action against any individuals involved with such pollution incidents.</PARA>
<PARA>The legal action was for breaches&mdash;and I do not say `alleged breaches'; I say `breaches' because they were never at any stage disputed&mdash;of 8B(1) of the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 1989 by virtue of the provisions of section 16(1) of the Clean Waters Act 1970. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the pigs in this piggery are housed in 15 sheds. Their effluent is collected underneath the sheds in trenches where it is discharged to the waste water treatment system. The solid and liquid pig waste is flushed into two separate but identical systems that screen solids and then direct liquids to primary treating ponds, and thence by gravity to irrigation ponds, whence it is irrigated onto other areas of the property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been informed that management of these systems is poor. There have been a number of instances where effluent has run off the property and polluted local water courses. The disposal of effluent and the generation of odour from the premises have created constant complaints from residents and action groups, principally in regard to odour. But I have been informed by the New South Wales government that the piggery is not controlled by any pollution control, licence or approval. It has been able to get away with this because the piggery commenced operation years before these requirements were introduced; in other words, there were prior use arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While a half owner of this company, our Prime Minister was quite happy for it to have inadequate, inappropriate, improper pollution arrangements in place, without making any attempt to fix them during the three years he was its half owner. What a hypocrite, that this man should stand up and claim to be the leader of a government which has strong concerns about pollution!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One incident occurred on 10 August 1993 when excessive irrigation had led to effluent of fairly high BOD and nutrient levels escaping the property. The detailed facts are that the office of the EPA received a phone call from the Scone-Parkville environmental watch group&mdash;which, as I say, I commend strongly for the way it has consistently pointed out the continuing pollution from Mr Keating's then half owned company&mdash;that reported that red effluent was coming down a gully leading from an irrigation paddock at Parkville piggery and running into a property owned by a Mr Dick Smith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the way, the effluent flow on analysis showed BOD of 120 mg/l, ammonia of 130 mg/l and Ph&mdash;phosphorus, I suppose&mdash;of 7.9. The effluent flow was then followed upstream to a hinge joint fence line on the western boundary of a paddock that the piggery uses to dispose of effluent by spray irrigation. Effluent was coming out of a pool of effluent at the southern end of a rough bank system running along the fence line. The pools of effluent and the soggy ground led to an irrigation spray jet located in the general nor'-nor'-east direction. The irrigation spray was not in operation at that time, but the extent of the spray impact circle around the spray jet could clearly be seen. Further investigation determined that there were no other possible sources of pollution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another incident occurred during an unplanned visit to the piggery and again revealed poor management of the waste water treatment system and high nutrient run-off. This was on 19 October 1993 when Commissioner Cleland had requested that the EPA take a water sample. They saw that the northern gully was running with mid-brown coloured water and the middle and southern gullies were running with clear water. Clear details of continuing environmental problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A local environment watch group was formed through the concerns of local residents over the impacts and discomfort of odours and discharges of effluent emanating from the Parkville piggery. In the seven months preceding this offence, EPA officers attended the piggery on three occasions to take water samples following complaints of effluent run-off. It seems to me that this is just a non-stop situation where there is contempt for the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The offences must be considered in light of the history of the piggery. They are aggravated having regard to the history and the difficulties of getting the piggery to apply proper management practices. Despite numerous visits, it has proven difficult to get management to do anything. To some extent, this situation has not been helped by the commission of inquiry which has tended to put active measures on hold. However, the piggery is still operating and still causing problems and will continue to do so, whether or not the joint venture with Danpork goes ahead. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution to the adjournment debate tonight is to discuss the decision of the full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to overturn the decision of Commissioner Hodder of December 1994. Commissioner Hodder's decision ordered that the small non-union company Asahi Diamond Industrial Australia Pty Ltd `shall negotiate in good faith' with the Automotive, Food, Metal and Engineering Union. That order was made despite the fact that, firstly, not a single one of Asahi's employees belonged to a union, nor did they want to belong; secondly, the employees were not interested in negotiating an agreement because they were satisfied with their present arrangements; and, thirdly, not a single employee wanted the union to be representing their interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an outrageous decision of Commissioner Hodder. It was made more outrageous by the fact that the decision flowed from an outrageous law. Overnight, the Hodder decision had the potential to destabilise all those highly successful and productive non-unionised companies right around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For both the unions and the employees, this test case had important principles at stake. On the one hand, employers, particularly those with non-union workplaces, bitterly opposed an enterprise bargaining system that forced them to negotiate with unions. On the other hand, the unions feared a system in which they might be locked out of the non-union sector. Indeed, the ACTU assistant secretary, Tim Pallas, has stated that the non-union sector is `a system that is tantamount to industrial apartheid'. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ACTU cannot and will not condone as consistent with the accord agreement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that they struck with the Labor government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a formalised and collective process for the unionised sector and an unaccountable, informal and unilateralist system for employers should they choose&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the latter system&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as their preferred option.</PARA>
<PARA>The full bench decision is really a very big slap in the face to the union movement. The company at the heart of the dispute, Asahi, is a small engineering works that employs about 42 workers under the metal industry award. It is now well known that the employees and the employers of Asahi had come to a union-free agreement on how they wanted to work in order to achieve their mutual interests of improved productivity and higher wages. The enterprise bargaining arrangement which was sealed at Asahi saw employees and employers happy. It was an effective arrangement&mdash;that is, until the militant AFMEU foisted itself onto the Asahi company against the explicit wishes of every single employee who worked there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The confusion that subsequently emerged baffled workers, puzzled the employer and perplexed most Australians who followed the case each evening on TV and in the newspapers the following morning. So much publicity was generated about this one small company that Asahi placed large advertisements thanking the many thousands of Australians who lent their support to the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the Asahi decision comes on top of plans announced earlier this week by Mr Kelty, the Secretary of the ACTU, to expand union membership by 200,000 by the year 1997. It was widely reported at the end of last year that Australian workers were leaving unions in droves because they were failing to meet their members' needs. Indeed, former Labor Senator Jim McClelland is now on record as saying that he believes there is no longer a useful role for trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it appears that workers all around the country agree with that. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released in December, combined with the ACTU's own figures, display the real extent of the defections from the trade union movement. The ABS labour force figures indicate that since 1988 there has been an overall decline in union membership of approximately seven per cent. That is of course despite a growing population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU executive meeting in Melbourne in early December backed up these figures. The meeting in fact was warned that union membership affiliated with the ACTU had fallen over the last year by 400,000, leaving a total of 2.4 million members. Later that same week the New South Wales Labor secretary, Peter Sams, admitted the picture was more grim, with membership closer to two million; that is, union membership affiliated with the ACTU had fallen by 800,000 in a relatively short period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that Mr Kelty, in his membership drive, is targeting only a quarter of the membership lost over the past year. The decline in membership really says a lot about the way in which unions are representing Australian workers today. To have the unions complain bitterly that the loss in membership will reduce their power to lobby governments stretches the imagination as to what role the union movement actually plays for its membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure most union members would be horrified to think that the only thing unions are concerned about is their grab for power and allowing Bill Kelty to sit around the cabinet table in Canberra. The fact is that unions have been playing the tune for the Australian Labor Party and have been forgetting the workers that they are supposed to represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the workers are finding that out themselves, and that is why they are leaving, not only in their thousands or tens of thousands but in their hundreds of thousands. Clearly, the desire to conscript new members at Asahi was a significant motive behind the union's actions. It is therefore very rewarding to see that that proposed action by the union failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many unions have consistently failed to meet the needs of employees who are looking for service providers to help them be part of the workplace culture. Trade unions have enjoyed enormous institutional, legal and political privilege within the Australian industrial relations system. Despite that privilege, their membership has been declining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since many unions have had a guaranteed role in the system, and automatic membership thanks to compulsory unionism, the incentive to meet employees' needs was of course greatly diminished. I suggest to the ACTU that the only way unions will grow will be when they start listening to their members and meeting their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Asahi test case decision is very significant because the workers at Asahi rejected union interference in their workplace. Amongst other things, in its conclusion, the full bench said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission cannot order a person to negotiate. Such an order is beyond power.</PARA>
<PARA>From all the stories I have seen on this particular case, the workers at Asahi were more than happy with the deal they struck with their employer. With militant AMEFU demands, the workers at Asahi are probably relieved that they are not members of a union organisation, that their employer was not forced to negotiate with that union, and that they can continue with the arrangements that they had enjoyed for so many years to the mutual benefit of both the company and the workers. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Big Bill Neidji gives his apologies for his absence today. It is not unexpected his not being here. You see he was born in nineteen hundred and twelve. That makes him some 83 years old. For him to travel from Jabiru to Darwin some 300 kilometres would mean no small effort on his part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mere fact that he is a senior and a most distinguished and respected citizen of this nation, and held in high esteem by equally distinguished visitors from many countries does not automatically grant him the benefits and privileges that most of his age and status would be entitled to. And that sadly, so very few get to enjoy. At 83 years old Bill Neidji knows that he has to fight for his country yet again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is with reluctance that I speak, without him being at my side. Not because I lack the confidence in doing so, but because, perhaps to all of you, only his presence would perhaps validate to you the issue I am about to relate. I assure you however I am under his careful instructions, that I am obligated to do so. His absence does not diminish in any way the message that I carry from him.</PARA>

By this, I mean, he carries the authority formed by a culture indigenous to the very land that your feet walk on today. His authority has been created and shaped by many decades of obligation, of ceremony and learning from the Old People of many, many generations. His authority has been created by personal actions and deeds and by strength and by teaching, kindness and most of all, by immense dignity. He has written books and spoken many times and been filmed in documentaries, seeking always to educate all others about Aboriginal culture, land and responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Age does not always guarantee having learned in ones life time, for truly there are some will never learn.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority and values held by Big Bill Neidji should not to be taken lightly. For they are precious and so very important to myself and many, many others. But I fear that perhaps that too often, despite his efforts, these values have been trodden over, clearly misinterpreted by ignorance or with purpose or sometimes dismissed, as just too hard to deal with. They may at first appear too complex to those with English as a first language, but I assure, they are not.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Authority dictates to Big Bill Neidji that he must speak about his country.

The Greens (WA) welcome the government's moves to protect the enforcement of human rights in response to the decision of the High Court in Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. We are also gratified that the High Court has handed down such a decision which reinforces one of the few constitutional protections of human rights in Australia, the separation of powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The separation of powers embodied in the constitution ensures that non-judicial persons cannot exercise judicial power. The necessity for a separation of powers and the protection of judiciary from arbitrary influence can be seen in the response of Jeff Kennett in Victoria to the victory of the Koori people in the Northcote college case.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General has stated that there were 37 determinations which were made between the passage of the amendments and the handing down of the High Court's decision in the Brandy case. It is fortunate that the validity of those amendments was tested at such an early stage before the rights of more people were adversely affected through the passage of the invalid legislation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, this is not the point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is important is that it is now the responsibility of the government to establish an effective and constitutionally valid mechanism for the protection of Human Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the short term the government has stated that it will move to amend the relevant legislation to return to the situation to before the 1992 amendments. While there is obviously a need to act rapidly it is important that this only be a temporary measure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was the lack of enforcibility of determinations in the pre-1992 Acts which led the government to attempt to create an alternative process, which has subsequently been found to be unconstitutional by the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since it is clear that determinations by Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission cannot be used as an enforcement mechanism, a Court mechanism must now be established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Interest Advocacy Centre in Sydney has advocated the establishment of a "Human Rights Court". Without wishing to pre-empt the recommendations of the Basten Committee, the Greens (WA) would support the establishment of such a Court. This would give Human Rights, and their protection, the status that they require and which have been lacking to date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under both the pre and post 1992 schemes, persons whose Human Rights had been infringed could not go directly to the Federal Court for enforcement. They had to go through the conciliation and determination process conducted by HREOC. For many people this would be seen as further barriers to the enforcement of their Human Rights. While HREOC has an admirable record in conciliating disputes, it is essential that any future regime allows people direct access to a court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We understand the difficulties faced by persons seeking to enforce their Human Rights and the differentials in power and resources between the victims and perpetrators of human rights abuse.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They must also ensure that there is adequate legal aid and other support for people seeking to protect their Human Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation which this Parliament has enacted to protect Human Rights is a good first step. However, there have never been the necessary enforcement mechanisms put in place.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The National Forest Policy Statement establishes a co-operative approach between the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments to identify and protect old-growth forests of high conservation value. The objective is to put in place a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. The Statement acknowledges that some areas of old-growth forest which are not required for the reserve system, will be harvested for some years to come to meet timber needs of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Prime Minister announced on 2 February 1995, the Commonwealth has put in place a process for assessing the conservation values of the 509 coupes identified as requiring further consideration before logging proceeds. Consistent with this process I have identified 57 coupes which satisfy the criteria for logging to continue. The Government is also considering the release of additional coupes which will be required to avoid stand-downs of forest workers. Coupes to be released are those where forest conservation values do not exist or where those values are well represented in conservation reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remaining coupes will be assessed in accordance with the 8 week assessment process outlined in the Prime Minister's Statement. Export approval will not be granted for woodchips sourced from these coupes unless it is assessed that these coupes would not be required for a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Approval for the export of woodchips derived from timber harvested within native forests has followed detailed consideration of the applications to ensure protection of environmental values and included consideration of advice from the Australian Heritage Commission. In approving licences for 1994, the then Minister for Resources, on the advice of the then Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, did not approve export of woodchips from some areas proposed for logging and these were subsequently withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Successive Resource Ministers have consulted the Australian Heritage Commission prior to deciding whether to renew annual woodchip export licences. The advice of the Australian Heritage Commission is an integral part of the decision making process. Where there is no feasible and prudent alternative to carrying-out a proposed export woodchip operation that may have an adverse impact on the national estate, the Commonwealth relies upon the advice of the Australian Heritage Commission and State forest management agencies for ways to minimise those adverse impacts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian Forest Practices Code specifically recognises the need to consult with Aboriginal people in matters of Aboriginal heritage. All areas with a high potential to contain significant Aboriginal sites are surveyed prior to logging by accredited and trained staff. If significant sites are found they are excluded from logging if appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the Gunn's Kilndried F, C coupes in the Great Western Tiers region, Forestry Tasmania has advised that these coupes are on the Silver Plains property owned by North Forest Products. An archaeological survey was carried out on the property in June 1992, under the supervision of Forestry Tasmania's Senior Archaeologist and with assistance from the Aboriginal community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coupes approved for logging in 1994 are not in or adjacent to any identified Aboriginal heritage sites or sensitive areas. Logging operations in these coupes have therefore proceeded this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the NFI Lake Sorrell coupes Forestry Tasmania has advised that the property is owned by Boral Timber Tasmania. The forests on the property have been logged since the 1950s initially for sawlog only and more recently for sawlog and pulpwood by logging of the previously cutover forest. Virtually all of the property has been logged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994 logging has continued in coupes 86 C, D, E, G and H under ongoing Timber Harvesting Plans prepared in accordance with the Forest Practices Code. The code includes provisions for the identification and management of cultural heritage during planning and operation of timber harvesting. As part of this process a roadline survey for Aboriginal heritage has been conducted by Boral and nothing found. The areas being harvested are considered to be of low Aboriginal heritage sensitivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) In the National Forest Policy Statement it is agreed that until assessments are completed forest management agencies will avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of old-growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value. This does not mean that all old-growth forest is to be avoided pending assessment of their values but refers to those areas likely to have high conservation value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Government's objective on the export of woodchips was announced by the Prime Minister on 22 December 1994. By the year 2000 the Government will ban the export of woodchips from those areas of Australia's native forests which are not covered by Regional Forest Agreements incorporating a reserve system that comprehensively represents all forest types. The amount of woodchips exported from native forests where there has not been significant progress towards a Regional Forest Agreement will be reduced by about 20 per cent per year to nil by the year 2000.</PARA>
