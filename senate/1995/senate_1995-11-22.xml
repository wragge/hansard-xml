<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EMDG scheme is recognised as contributing significantly to the enhancement of an export culture in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our potential and emerging exporters are by their nature often small businesses with limited experience and resources. The government wishes to provide some guidance to these exporters while limiting public expenditure where support is least likely to have a chance of success. To this end this bill introduces the framework for a flexible grants entry test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also reduces the maximum annual grant from $250,000 to $200,000, providing for fairer distribution of the available funding amongst small and medium exporters, whilst continuing to provide a substantial grant to the larger claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effective management of risk to the public purse, accountability of all participants and a transparency of operation, are considerations to which government financial assistance schemes must have high regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill addresses a number of matters associated with these considerations as they apply to the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974. The Australian National Audit Office, which undertook in 1993/94 an extensive effectiveness and efficiency audit of the scheme, made a number of recommendations on issues of risk management and accountability. Austrade, the agency responsible for the administration of the scheme, had already commenced enhancing procedures in a number of related areas. The audit office's recommendations gave further focus and emphasis to the upgrading process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Raising the standard and accuracy of lodged claims benefits the client through faster processing and subsequent payment of grants, and benefits Austrade by facilitating the movement of resources away from routine administrative matters. By limiting the amount by which a claim for grant can be increased between the time of lodgement and its assessment, this bill reduces the scope for lodgement of ill prepared or ambit claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is currently no limit to the number of EMDG approved Joint Venture and Consortium (AJVC) of which a "person" may be a member. As the EMDG scheme is focused on small to medium size business, it is considered that the resources of these organisations could not reasonably support involvement in more than a limited number of AJVC, and maintain focus. Further, the potential for individual organisations to receive very large amounts of EMDG funding through multiple membership is significant. AJVC have no automatic right to access the EMDG scheme, and are provided with EMDG claimant status against ministerially approved guidelines. To provide flexibility in establishing the optimal maximum number of AJVC  membership, this bill provides for the limit to be set by ministerially approved guideline. Membership of a maximum of three AJVC is considered appropriate at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austrade has the power to cancel the status of an AJVC where it breaches the provisions of the act or ministerially approved guidelines, or specific conditions of its approval. However, regardless of the circumstances of the breach of conditions, Austrade does not have the power to deduct from a previously lodged but yet unassessed AJVC claim, the amount of grant generated by the breach of conditions. This bill allows that deduction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austrade is moving to minimise scope for fraudulent or dishonest behaviour under the EMDG scheme. Recent amendments prevent insolvent persons and persons convicted of certain offences from claiming EMDG. This bill excludes from eligibility claims prepared with the assistance of a consultant or other person convicted of fraud or dishonesty offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst disclosure requirements under the EMDG scheme would severely inhibit lodgement of a claim for the promotion of an illegal activity, the EMDG act does not specifically prevent the payment of grant in respect of expenditure which is related to illegal activities. The bill formalises this implied limitation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, except in limited specified circumstances, an `in house' expense such as the salary of a claimant's Australian based employee, is not claimable under the scheme. The wording of the legislation, however, does not preclude such a payment where it is made to an interposed company which, to all intents and purposes is a payment to a person ordinarily employed in australia by the claimant. This bill renders payments in these circumstances, ineligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first day of sitting of 1996, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Before giving leave, I ask the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) whether he could give us some indication as to the state of the program. What the minister is now seeking is extended sitting times. We started early yesterday to facilitate the government's program.

I also convened other meetings of senators to discuss the program. I would urge the opposition to cooperate as much as it can with the legislative program the government has before the chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, I have been here to listen with avid interest&mdash;I am sure I am the only Australian to have done so&mdash;to these matters that you have proposed before the chamber. I think in the extra sitting week of the Senate we had a matter of public importance or an urgency motion every single day. There have been a number of proposals to suspend standing orders. There was a suspension of standing orders in relation to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), and what I have tried to do is to work cooperatively with all the parties in the Senate to ensure that we maximise the amount of time we have to deal with the legislative program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do note that all minor parties, the government and independent senators were willing to sit on both Monday and Tuesday of the last two sitting weeks but, because Senator Hill was unable to make a decision on behalf of the opposition in relation to Monday, I made a decision, as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, not to force the issue and accept that in the spirit of trying to work these matters through cooperatively, we lost that sitting time on the Monday of last week between 12.30 p.m. and 2 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be proposing in relation to next week that we look at not only sitting at 12.30 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday but also the possibility of not dealing with general business on the Thursday and the possibility of suspending the sitting on Thursday and concluding the business of the Senate at 3.45 p.m. on Friday, 1 December. I also want to talk to senators in the chamber about the possibility of extending the sitting on Thursday evening. It is a possibility that I flagged with all senators, and there is a possibility of doing that on either the Monday or Tuesday of the next sitting week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of this comes as a surprise to any senator. I have talked about it at length to the whips.

I will be retaining that level of commitment, and I encourage the opposition to approach this task in the same spirit&mdash;not to waste time, not to filibuster, not to obstruct the government's legislative program, but to cooperate with the government in the good interests of progressing the substantial legislative program that we have before us. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill contains several important measures announced in the 1995 budget for the social security and veterans' affairs portfolios. The reforms will bring increased security and stability to customers while continuing the government's commitment to target assistance to those in our community who are most in need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A common thread throughout these initiatives is the simplification of existing policy and the elimination of excessively bureaucratic procedures. It is true that the scope and complexity of the Australian social security system, placing as it does considerable demands on administrators, has sometimes created procedures and rules that confuse and frustrate people. The government has made it a priority in recent times to examine ways in which the system may be simplified and made more user friendly. That work continues, with this bill marking a further step.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One major initiative in this bill arises directly from the recommendations on the pension income and assets tests contained in the independently commissioned report "Targeting for Equity". The report was based on extensive consultations with pensioners, retirement community groups and industry groups who supported simple and more predictable means testing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, there are many different and complex rules for assessing the income generated by financial investments. In some cases, the rules depend on when the investment was made. From 1 July 1996, all of these rules (including the rules for assessing unrealised capital growth on managed investments and shares) will be replaced with one set of rules for working out income from financial investments. These rules will apply to all social security and veterans' affairs pensions and allowances (with the exception of family payments).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments build on the successful bank deeming measure. They respond to the concerns of pensioners themselves about the complexity of investment rules, the frequent changes caused to pension payments and the effect on incentives to earn more from investments. The new rules are simpler, fairer and more predictable, and will encourage people to maximise their resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extended deeming rules will apply to bank, building society and credit union accounts, cash, term deposits, friendly society bonds and other managed investments, shares, loans and debentures. They will also apply to gifts of assets of more than the allowable limit. The rules will not apply to the principal home or its contents; cars, boats or caravans; antiques or stamp or coin collections; standard life insurance policies; or holiday homes, farms or other real estate. They also will not apply to income stream products such as superannuation pensions, allocated pensions, immediate annuities or allocated annuities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under extended deeming, the total value of a person's financial investments will be used to work out income from these investments. A deeming rate of 5 per cent will apply to the first $30,000 of the total for single people, to the first $50,000 (combined) for pensioner couples and to the first $25,000 for each member of a non-pensioner couple. A deeming rate of 7 per cent will apply to the value of investments over these thresholds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 5 per cent and 7 per cent deeming rates have been set so that they are easily achievable in safe investments. The deeming rates will be reviewed periodically to take into account movements in financial markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, people who earn more than the deeming rates will not have the extra counted as income and it will not reduce their payments. This significant change will encourage people to maximise their income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current rule assessing capital growth on certain managed investments when they are cashed in will be abolished from Royal Assent to this bill. This concession will allow people who wish to change their investments before July 1996 to do so, without their payments being adversely affected by past capital growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People will have plenty of time (until July 1996) to consider their situation and adjust their investments if they wish. They will be encouraged to use the free and significantly expanded Social Security Financial Information Service for information on whether they will be affected, and on the issues they could consider in making any investment changes. They could also get information from the National Information Centre on Retirement Investments, which has had its funding further increased in the 1995 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The simplifying and customer oriented changes to the Pension Loans Scheme will give social security and veterans' affairs pensioners more say in when and how they receive their pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Pension Loans Scheme is a scheme under which the assets of a pensioner whose pension would otherwise be reduced because of the assets test are disregarded so that they no longer have any effect on the pension. The difference between what the pension is under the scheme and what it should be under the assets test is the "loan". In return, the pensioner incurs a debt of the difference in the pension plus a specified rate of interest, but the debt is not recoverable until after the pensioner's death. The loan is secured by the disregarded assets. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Pension Loans Scheme will be made more attractive to age pensioners and their partners by relaxing or abolishing some of the current loan conditions. The fortnightly rate of the loan will be lifted to the maximum pension rate or a rate specified by the pensioner, whichever is the lower. Therefore, pensioners will be able to take maximum advantage of their assets under the scheme. However, to participate in the scheme, the pensioner would have to be entitled to some payment under either the income or assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Participants in the scheme will become entitled to withdraw from the arrangement at any time. If they do so, either the loan could be repaid immediately or the debt could be left to be recovered after death, although it continues to accrue interest until it has been repaid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To participate in the scheme, there is a current arbitrary rule that at least $100,000 must be left in a person's estate after the debt is repaid. This rule will be replaced with a new, more flexible one. Under the new rule, the pensioner may nominate a "guaranteed amount" to be left in the estate after the loan is repaid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The asset types to be used as security by the commonwealth will now be limited to real estate. Also, the interest rate used in the Pension Loans Scheme will now be expressed in compound interest terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of the difficulties faced by many older unemployed people in the labour market, mature age allowance was introduced in 1994, with a sunset clause of June 1996,. There are over 37,000 mature age allowance recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mature age allowance regime has proven so effective in providing appropriate support for older disadvantaged workers that the government has decided to remove the sunset clause. At the same time, other simplifying changes are being made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current requirement that recipients have 12 months' CES registration will be replaced with a requirement that they have no recent workforce experience. People transferring to mature age allowance from unemployment payments will now have to have nine months', rather than 12 months', history on income support. People who lose entitlement to other payments such as carer pension and parenting allowance will not have to establish any particular period of income support history to transfer to mature age allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although recipients will not be required to look for work, they may do so if they wish. If they do so, they may register with the CES and receive labour market program assistance. The allowance will be payable under social security benefit conditions (including benefit income and assets tests), although it will continue to be based on pension rates and carry pension-type concessions. However, existing recipients will continue to be paid under pension conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another major change brought into effect by this bill is the streamlining of payments for unemployed people into a single system which will tailor administrative requirements according to people's individual needs and circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current distinction between job search and newstart allowances is primarily based on CES registration for 12 months. This distinction once represented a move from one level of income support to a more active promotion of labour market and training opportunities. However, over the years, the distinction has become more blurred, with additional labour market help such as training programs and case management support now being based on the likelihood of becoming long term unemployed, rather than being in receipt of newstart allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From September 1996, the current two-tiered system will be replaced by a single payment called newstart allowance which will be available to people regardless of their period of unemployment. The simplified system will be coupled with an earlier review process in an intensive effort to prevent people from joining the ranks of the long term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be an intensive review of all those who have remained unemployed for nine months. Some of those will also be selected for an additional review. The existing three month review of all recipients will remain. This review will identify people at risk of becoming long term unemployed, so that they can be referred to appropriate services and assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, people whose job search efforts are already being closely monitored or who face particular hurdles such as age, will benefit from more flexible reporting requirements. Some people whose search for work is closely supervised via one-on-one case management will be given the option of submitting forms every four weeks. This option will also be available to people undertaking formal training, voluntary work or short courses. Anyone over 50 who is unemployed and is transferring to job search or newstart allowance after at least 12 months on a pension such as carer pension, will have the option of reporting every 12 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People to be offered the reduced reporting option will be carefully selected using a screening tool that will take into account factors such as age, length of time on income support, past record of compliance with reporting and other requirements and local labour market conditions. The measures will not relax the job search efforts required of unemployed people in return for their income support, but they will streamline those requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People in rural and remote areas will also have the option of making individual arrangements with their regional office about how and when they lodge their forms. For example, this may include lodging forms when visiting services are available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From March 1996, people receiving job search, newstart or youth training allowance who become temporarily incapacitated for work will no longer have to transfer to sickness allowance. Instead, they will remain on their usual allowance but will be exempt from job search activity while they are ill. People who become unemployed because of illness and those who suffer a potential loss of income due to illness will be paid the appropriate unemployment payment instead of sickness allowance. Sickness allowance will be paid only to those who will return to their jobs or study when they recover.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure makes much more sense administratively, and it will allow people who are ill to undertake part-time work if they are capable of it and to retain access to employment and education entry payments. They will also maintain continuity of unemployment history so that they are not disadvantaged later in relation to access to labour market programs, case management and job compact eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The allowance earnings credit scheme will be modified from March 1996 to eliminate some anomalies and to focus it more effectively on customers with casual or part-time earnings. An allowance recipient's earnings credit will accrue at a rate equal to the amount of the unused free area in any fortnight. The maximum amount of the earnings credit that can be used in any fortnight will be limited to $100.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lastly, the bill also contains two Protocols that amend the international social security agreement between Australia and New Zealand. The first Protocol provides for amendments mainly of a technical nature, while the second Protocol enables people being paid under the agreement to leave their country of residence for short periods of time without losing entitlement to their pensions. It also provides for reimbursement by the country of origin to continue during these absences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When negotiating the Protocols, it was Australia's objective to extend the temporary absence period for all pension types to 26 weeks (that is, not just for age pensions). New Zealand would not agree to this. We believe that 26 weeks is a fair period of time to allow for the continuation of pension payments for people moving temporarily between Australia and New Zealand. It is our intention to continue urging New Zealand to reconsider its position on this issue. Nevertheless the Protocols will improve the operation of the agreement for both countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (1995-96 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL (No. 2) 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the second Veterans' Affairs 1995-96 Budget Measures Bill. It gives effect to the remaining Government Budget initiatives that need legislation. Many of the measures in this bill address the particular needs of our older veterans, most of whom are now in their 70s and served in World War Two. In this year, while we have commemorated their achievements and sacrifices in that conflict, it is important that we continue to look at ways to improve our caring for their immediate and future needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initiatives in this bill, and other related measures that do not require legislation, demonstrate once again that the Department of Veterans' Affairs is at the cutting edge of aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before I address the specific items in this bill, I want to mention some of the Government's 1995-96 Budget initiatives that do not require legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First is the extension of the free advisory and referral services of the very successful Veterans' Home Maintenance Helpline. This Service will now be available to all veterans, war widows and war widowers. It provides a valuable support to those who own their own home, by providing advice on a broad range of matters, from replacing a fuse to installing a new bathroom. Wherever possible, the Helpline links the client to Government subsidised services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second valuable supporting initiative is the development of a program for discharge planning. This program will ensure appropriate care continues after an eligible veteran, war widow or war widower is discharged from hospital. The program recognises that attention to the special needs of patients in the post acute phase of an illness is important to their successful rehabilitation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People who provide full time care for our veterans play an invaluable role. They allow many veterans to continue to live in their own home or in the community when they would otherwise be unable to manage.  The carer's task is often a difficult one. The Department of Veterans' Affairs is continuing to look at ways to assist the carers. Recently the Minister for Veterans' Affairs launched a practical guide for carers of people with dementia. Other initiatives to provide practical assistance to carers are being developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part of the support for those providing care in the veteran community is through the provision of carer service pensions. This bill includes a number of measures that extend access to carer service pensions, and it also puts into place a number of changes that reflect the needs and situations of many carers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Carer service pensions are now available only to those who are caring for veterans who receive a service pension. The bill extends eligibility for a carer service pension to those who are caring for certain veterans who do not receive an income support payment from either the Department of Veterans' Affairs or the Department of Social Security.  If the carer meets other, existing eligibility criteria, a carer service pension will become payable to a person providing care for a veteran whose family income is less than $61 020, with assets of less than $559 250. These limits will rise in line with increases in the family payment income and assets tests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A similar extension of carer benefits will be made to war widows and war widowers who provide care for another person. These carers will be eligible for an income support supplement if the person under care does not receive a service pension from the Department of Veterans' Affairs or a pension or benefit from the Department of Social Security, but does meet the basic family payment income and assets tests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill removes the current requirement that allows a carer service pension to be paid only where the carer lives in the same house as the person receiving care, or adjacent to that house. As long as the person provides the necessary level of care, it will not matter where the carer lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another important Budget measure in this bill is the continuation of the carer service pension for 14 weeks after the veteran is admitted permanently to a nursing home or other institutionalised care. The carer service pension currently ceases as soon as the veteran permanently enters a nursing home. The continuation of the payment to the carer will allow that person time to adjust to changed responsibilities and to make arrangements for their future income and, possibly, a new place to live.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill ensures those receiving or providing community care are not financially disadvantaged by entering into that arrangement. If a person leaves their home to provide care for a veteran, the value of their home will be disregarded under the service pension assets test for two years. Similarly, if the veteran leaves his or her home to receive care in some other place in the community, the value of the veteran's home will not be included as an asset for two years. In addition, those leaving their home to provide or to receive care will be immediately eligible for rent assistance if they are paying rent for their new residence. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, in addition to the change in rent assistance I just mentioned, this bill contains a number of other rent assistance measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From March 1996, the maximum rates of rent assistance for families with children will be increased by $5 a fortnight. This increase reflects the higher cost often associated with renting private accommodation that meets the needs of families with children. The Government also recognises the extra costs incurred by a single pensioner raising a child and, in this bill, increases the rate of guardian allowance by $4 a fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill increases rent thresholds by $5 a fortnight to coincide with the March 1996 CPI increase. This increase ensures rent assistance continues to target pensioners who pay relatively higher rents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are currently a number of pensioners who retained eligibility for rent assistance, or for a beneficial rate of rent assistance, that they were receiving at the time of rent assistance reforms in 1989 and 1993. These people have continued to receive a higher rate of income support than others who are assessed under current provisions. The bill makes two specific provisions relating to these pensioners. First it ensures that those income support pensioners eligible for one of these retained rent assistance payments, who transfer back to the Department of Veterans' Affairs from the Department of Social Security, can continue to receive that payment. Second, the retained payments are to be gradually phased out. From March 1996, any CPI increase in the total service pension payments will be offset against those rent assistance payments until the total amount payable is equal to the total amount payable to others in the same circumstances. This change will achieve equity in income support payments without  reducing the total amount paid  to the pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the payment of a residential care allowance to certain pensioners in a nursing home or hostel. The allowance replaces any rent assistance now paid to these pensioners. It will be paid at the same rate and subject to the same threshold, indexation and all other provisions as are now applied to rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the bill also includes two measures to assist veterans and other income support beneficiaries under Veterans' Affairs legislation in the management of their living expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will allow certain specified classes of deductions to be made from service pensions at the request of the pensioner. This will allow payments, such as rent to government housing authorities, to be deducted and paid direct to the authority. This arrangement will provide a valuable service to veterans and other income support recipients, particularly our aged and infirm pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second measure will allow certain service pensioners access to an advance of their pension of up to $500 to assist them to meet unexpected living expenses. The Government recognises that many service pensioners have limited cash reserves and can have difficulty obtaining access to lump sum amounts to help them meet costs associated with, say emergency repairs and replacements. The lump sum advance of pension will have no interest or other charges. Repayments will be at a level the pensioner can afford, and can be spread out over 6 months. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget provided for an adjustment to be made to the bereavement payment to the partner of a person who was also receiving a war widow or war widower pension at the time of death. The adjustment removes the limitation on the amount of the war widow or war widower's income support pension from the calculation of the bereavement payment to the surviving partner.  The bill gives effect to this adjustment within a major re-write of the Veterans' Affairs legislation relating to bereavement payments. This re-write includes some minor policy changes to remove superfluous provisions or to correct inconsistencies. The new provisions significantly simplify what had become very complex legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes a number of minor changes to other acts. The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 is to be changed as a consequence of the introduction of the residential care allowance, and the re-write of the bereavement payment provisions in this bill. That act will also include changes that follow on previous Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Acts. These changes include the introduction of income support supplement, and the repeal of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940. There are also minor changes to the Fringe Benefits Tax (Application to the Commonwealth) Act 1986 as a result of the repeal of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940. The Social Security Act 1991 is to be amended to incorporate a provision relating to rent assistance to social security pensioners or beneficiaries that is now included in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, but is being repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In concluding, Mr President, I believe this bill provides sound and positive measures that respond to the changing needs of the veteran community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 (the Tariff Act) to incorporate into the Tariff Act Excise Tariff Proposals Nos. 1, 2 and 3 of 1995, which were tabled in the Parliament earlier in the year. In addition, this bill proposes to implement changes in the excise treatment of condensate and topped crude petroleum oil (topped crude).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal changes contained in the bill relate to: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)the exclusion of the rate of excise duty applicable to beer produced from "micro-breweries" and "U-brews" from indexation from 1 April 1994;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)the increase in excise duty on manufactured tobacco and tobacco products by 10 per cent from 10 May 1995;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)the amendment of the physical characteristics of fuel oil from 1 July 1995, to effectively remove "light" fuel oil from the concessional rate of excise applying to fuel oil;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv)an increase in the excise duty on aviation gasoline (avgas) and aviation kerosene (avtur) from 1 July 1995;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v)the exemption of condensate from the application of the Tariff Act where it is separately produced, or separately marketed, from stabilized crude petroleum oil (stabilized oil) from 11 October 1995; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(vi)the removal of the transport fuel substitution potential for topped crude from 11 October 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(I)Exclusion of the rate of excise duty applicable to beer produced from "micro-breweries" and "U-brews" from indexation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under section 6A of the Tariff Act, rates of excise duty set out in the Schedule to the Tariff Act may be subject to indexation in accordance with the Consumer Price Index on February 1 and August 1 of any year. Presently, specified rates of excise duty are not subject to indexation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 1 April 1994, beer produced from "micro-breweries" and "U-brews" was made excisable under the Tariff Act. Under the present provisions of section 6A, the rate of excise duty that applies to such beer is subject to indexation. However, this amounts to a double indexation of this rate of duty as this rate is directly linked to the rate of excise on commercially produced beer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 3 and Schedule 1 of the bill propose to amend section 6A of the Tariff Act to ensure that the rate of excise duty on beer produced from "micro-breweries" and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"U-brews" is not subject to indexation. This amendment is also proposed to take effect from 1 April 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment was proposed in Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1 of 1995, which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 8 February 1995 and took effect on and from 1 April 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(II)Increase in excise duty on manufactured tobacco and tobacco products by 10 per cent</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Budget night, the Treasurer announced a 10 per cent increase in the rate of excise duty payable on manufactured tobacco and tobacco products with effect from 10 May 1995. While raising additional revenue, this measure also supports Government health policy that is aimed at discouraging smoking. As a consequence of this 10 per cent increase, it is also proposed to remove manufactured tobacco and tobacco products from the 5 per cent discretionary increase in excise duty which was due to take effect on 1 August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 4 and Schedule 2 of the bill propose to amend the Tariff Act to implement these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment was proposed in Excise Tariff Proposal No. 2 of 1995, which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 9 May 1995 and took effect on and from</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(III)Amendment of the physical characteristics of fuel oil from 1 July 1995, to effectively remove "light" fuel oil from the concessional rate of excise applying to fuel oil</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Budget night, the Treasurer also announced measures that were intended to close the revenue loophole allowing "light" fuel oil to be used as a substitute for diesel, especially in the transport area. "Light" fuel oil is excisable at the concessional rate of duty applying to fuel oil and diesel is excisable at a considerably higher rate of duty. It is proposed to amend the physical characteristics of fuel oil, as set out in subsection 3(4) of the Tariff Act, in order to exclude "light" fuel oil with effect from 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this proposed amendment is that "light" fuel oil will no longer comply with the physical characteristics of fuel oil. As a result, "light" fuel oil will become excisable at the higher rate of duty applying the diesel fuel, thus removing the commercial incentive to continue to use "light" fuel oil as a transport fuel substitute for diesel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 5 and item 1 of Schedule 3 propose to amend the Tariff Act to implement this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment was proposed in Excise Tariff Proposal No. 3 of 1995, which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 29 June 1995 and took effect on and from</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(IV)Increase in the excise duty on aviation gasoline (avgas) and aviation kerosene (avtur)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 5 and items 2 and 3 of Schedule 3 propose increases in the rates of excise duty payable on avgas and avtur with effect from 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed to increase the rate of excise duty on avgas by 1.847 cents per litre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of this increase, 0.883 cents will contribute to funding air safety regulation, undertaken by the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority, that benefits the travelling public and, in part, aviation industry participants. The remaining increase of 0.964 cents per litre on avgas will recover part of the airways costs that are attributable to avgas powered aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also proposed to increase the excise duty on (avtur) by 0.883 cents per litre. As with avgas, this increase will contribute to funding air safety regulation that benefits the travelling public and, in part, aviation industry participants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These increases were announced in the 1995-96 Budget and form part of the Government's continuing cost recovery strategy with respect to air safety regulation and the provision of airways services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments were also proposed in Excise Tariff Proposal No. 3 of 1995, which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 29 June 1995 and took effect on and from 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(V)Exemption of condensate from the application of the Tariff Act where it is separately produced, or separately marketed, from stabilized crude petroleum oil (stabilized oil)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also proposes to remove an unintended consequence of the Tariff Act with respect to condensate that is separately produced from stabilized oil.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the first crude oil development soon to commence production from the North West Shelf Project area (which is now the only offshore area subject to the excise regime), small quantities of stabilized oil will be mixed with the condensate stream. It is not technically possible to remove all the stabilized oil from the natural gas/condensate stream.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under subsection 5B(3) of the Tariff Act, where this mixture of condensate and stabilized oil is entered for home consumption, all the condensate will be deemed to be stabilized oil and excisable at the rate of excise under sub-item 17A. This is clearly not the intention of the policy first introduced in 1977 which was designed to encourage condensate production by giving condensate concessional excise treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is, therefore, proposed to create an exception to the operation of subsection 5B(3) in respect of condensate that is separately produced from stabilized oil. As a corollary to this, it is also proposed to make condensate that is separately produced, or separately marketed, from stabilized oil excise exempt. However, condensate that is for use as a fuel will continue to be excisable under other provisions of the Tariff Act as will condensate that is produced with, and entered as a mixture with, stabilized oil.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are contained in clause 6 and items 1, 2 and 4 of Schedule 4 to the bill and are to take effect from 11 October 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(VI)Removal of the transport fuel substitution potential for topped crude</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes to increase the rate of excise duty payable on certain topped crude from its present concessional rate to the rate applying to diesel with effect from 11 October 1995. Presently, topped crude is excisable at the same concessional rate as fuel oil. Topped crude will continue to be excise free where it is for use as refinery feedstock. Topped crude which has the same characteristics as fuel oil as defined under subsection 3(4) of the Tariff Act will also continue to be excisable at the concessional rate applying to fuel oil.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment is intended to remove a potential diesel fuel substitution problem with topped crude that exists due to the excise rate differentials between topped crude and diesel. This substitution problem is similar to the "light" fuel oil substitution, which has also been addressed by this bill, as it is possible for some topped crudes to be used as transport fuel substitutes for diesel fuel. Therefore, by increasing the excise duty payable on topped crude not having the characteristics of fuel oil to the same rate as diesel fuel, the commercial incentive to use topped crude as a substitute for diesel, particularly in the transport area, is removed.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is aimed at increasing the flexibility of the operations of the Industry Commission, which is the government's major advisory body on industry matters, broadly defined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government values the major contribution of the Industry Commission as a catalyst for microeconomic reform in Australia. Its strengths are its independence, established expertise, public inquiry process, and economy-wide approach to examining issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in the bill are of a purely procedural nature, and involve three basic changes: </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">allowing Commissioners to be appointed on a part-time basis, including permanent part-time employment, in addition to the current full-time basis;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a consequential increase in the number of Commissioners, other than the Chairperson, from eight to eleven; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">allowing the progression of the Commission's public hearings in emergency situations, where one or more Commissioners may be unable to attend due to circumstances beyond their control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first basic change follows from the current provision in the Industry Commission Act 1989 which only allows Commissioners to be appointed on a full-time basis. The government has found that this provision limits its ability to attract a more diverse range of suitably qualified people. This change will allow the government to recruit those who hold other positions and are unwilling to become full-time Commissioners. Consequently the bill has been drafted to allow the appointment of Commissioners on either a full-time or a part-time basis, with equal powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second basic change, of increasing the maximum number of Commissioners, necessarily follows the first. The Commission will need to maintain the same level of resources at the Commissioner level, thus requiring more Commissioners in total if there are to be part-time appointees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third basic change is intended to provide additional flexibility to the Commission in the conduct of its public hearings. Where one or more Commissioners on an inquiry are unable to attend a scheduled public hearing, due to unforeseen circumstances such as accident, illness or injury, the remaining Commissioner will be able to preside at the public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining amendments are drafting changes consequential on the above proposed amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments do not have any financial implications. However should the number and mix of full-time and part-time Commissioners increase beyond the present funding levels, an increase in funding will be sought through the normal budgetary processes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time the debate was curtailed last night, I was speaking about the first of two unrelated tax bills; that is, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). I was mentioning that the Australian Taxation Office will have to fight out with academic linguists the definition about what is deductible, but the important thing is that they appear willing to have lime to reduce soil acidity included under section 75D(1B)(c).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To continue, the rest of the lack of clarity appears to be that there has been some confusion, at least at the level of farmers and some rural tax agents, about the deductibility of lime in fields to reduce acidity. Our amendment will clarify the situation, and hopefully Primary Industries and Energy will explicitly exclude in its future booklets the application of lime or other agents to reduce acidity or salinity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the ATO says our amendment makes no difference under law, there may be a financial impact from increased clarity. Any decrease in tax revenue should be weighed against the total impact of the benefits of soil improvement. The whole issue really came to my attention when farmers expressed some concern about the potential increase in the cost of lime due to the changes in the diesel rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application of lime is an agricultural practice, so diesel use in application is already rebatable. The entire cost of the operation, including materials, should be 100 per cent rebatable. Since the application is periodic rather than annual, choices can be made over a five- to 10-year time frame to allow farmers to maximise the benefits of a rebate. It is not a simple case of a required expense where rebates are worthless because there is no profit and no tax paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens would love to do more and have supported increases to rebates for landcare of greater than 100 per cent. We have put them in budget requests and have supported such measures in the Senate. We also support other measures to reduce cost or provide positive benefits for landcare. But we hope we can get at the very least support from all members of the Senate on this simple request. I commend those amendments to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill. Fringe benefits and their taxation will always be a contentious issue, but I do not propose to review the inadequacies of the FBT law at this time. This late in the session I will confine myself to the major issues of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From our standpoint, a major issue has been and remains the cost of compliance in relation to the fringe benefits tax and other tax regimes. These costs generally are the result of two factors: the push for self-assessment and the refusal of the ATO to establish what are reasonable general costs of certain things so that massive documentation of the exact expense can be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken on the self-assessment issue several times. Basically, the push for self-assessment allows the ATO to avoid employing people to do an expert assessment by shifting that responsibility to the taxpayer. The ATO then employs people to check the taxpayer's assessment and then prosecutes if any mistakes are made. The taxpayer works under the assumption of knowledge under the law and any mistake is categorised as tax fraud, regardless of how confusing the tax laws are. I have had senior ATO staff in my office saying that some of the laws are so convoluted that they do not know what the laws mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the ATO decides that the interpretation of a taxpayer is wrong, the taxpayer is stigmatised as a tax cheat and punished. They are not people who might want to work the system to their benefit, but there is this general assumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other senators who deal regularly with taxation would certainly know of cases where the interpretations and rulings of the ATO are questionable. Several have been challenged in the AAT or in the courts. Others have also heard stories about how punitive and vindictive the ATO might be, sending businesses bankrupt during extensive court cases, which ultimately the taxpayer won, although the businesses had since been liquidated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole situation creates an environment of suspicion, antagonism and vilification, one in which businesses especially operate in a miasma of justified fear lest they inevitably make some error. As a result, many businesses go to great lengths to try to comply with tax requirements. The more onerous those requirements are, the more time and cost are involved in compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of fringe benefits, the major issue is determining when an expense is required by the nature of the business and when it is part of a remuneration package. For example, when is accommodation reasonable to meet the requirements of the work and when is it unnecessarily luxurious, a fringe benefit to the employee?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be possible to sit down with industry to work out what a reasonable standard of accommodation is for various jobs and locations and then ask that the company show evidence that a trip was made&mdash;for example, cheque or credit card records of a flight booking&mdash;and verify that it was made for business purposes. A base level of accommodation and food costs should be assumed and verification required only for expenses above that level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might employees cheat, stay in a cheap dosshouse, eat peanut butter sandwiches and pocket the money saved? I suppose so. But if we assume that level of calculation by employees then, if forced to verify everything, they will go out to restaurants and ensure that they spend their allowance. The government or business will get nothing out of it. Businesses will have a vastly increased compliance cost in the need to collect, verify, process and store every receipt the employee gets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since there is a greater chance that some receipts will get lost, it will be difficult to obtain from employees a satisfactory receipt. There is a greater chance that employers will make a mistake or some claim based on a specific receipt may be interpreted as invalid. There is a much greater chance that the ATO will get a bit of extra money and the business be branded as tax cheats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For us, the major impediment in this bill was the huge extra compliance costs involved in absolute justification and verification of each actual expense under the living away from home allowance. It seemed to me that it would have greatly increased the cost of compliance in time, useless effort and money, and with very little positive outcome. I am very pleased that the government has put forward amendments to delete its proposed living away from home compliance provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that change, I feel that the rest of the bill is basically acceptable. I understand there are a few amendments; for instance, in relation to taxis. The proposal is to extend the hours at which a taxi is considered a valid expense from 7.00 p.m. to 7.00 a.m., rather than from 8.00 p.m. to 8.00 a.m. That might well be reasonable. Most people do not start work before 8.00 a.m., and they finish by 6.00 p.m. It gets dark in winter before 6.00 p.m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the amendment would make much difference. It would allow those asked to work overtime or at times when walking the streets may be dangerous to get transport. Perhaps during the committee stage the government, if it has problems with that in terms of the cost of the measure, will be able to give us further details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it will impose an extra cost on government, it might be small. If it opens the door for rorts, we need to know about that. How many people does the government expect will come in one or two hours early or stay one or two hours late, with the connivance of their employer, in order to get a non-FBT taxi ride? I guess it would be about the same number as those who come in before 6 o'clock to get a non-FBT taxi ride and spend an hour or so having breakfast before work or those who do an hour overtime and then go out for a drink while waiting for non-FBT taxi time to arrive. Of course, these people would also need the connivance of their employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Realistically, I do not think the number of people who go out of their way to get an FBT-free taxi ride is high, especially since their employer is paying for the taxi whether or not FBT is owing. I do not think the number of businesses that connive to convince employees to live out their lives so that the ATO can get cheated out of FBT is particularly high. Frankly, I think the ATO perception that everybody lives their lives with the sole goal of tax evasion may be somewhat paranoid. I can understand that it is necessary for them to protect revenue. It is equally necessary for the Senate to inject a bit of balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the coalition will be putting amendments on the taxi issue and will also be putting amendments to index the $5 level in car parking to the CPI. The $5 level is the figure used to calculate car parks as a fringe benefit. I understand the government's argument that car parking costs do not generally vary gradually with the CPI, but the government has no method for determining how the costs do vary. This leaves a situation where more and more parking will be considered a fringe benefit, against the principle that it should represent a real advantage relative to the availability and cost of car parking for those not provided a place at work. Since the government suggests no mechanism for recognising real variation in cost, we will support the coalition measure as better than the existing situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will digress briefly here to say that parking is a slightly strange situation, since many businesses are required by zoning ordinances to provide parking. They then must make employees pay, tell employees to park elsewhere, or pay FBT. We will also support the coalition change to the parking formula in item 4 of schedule 3. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we multiply the 52 weeks in the year by five days a week, we get 260 working days. If we subtract the four weeks of annual leave, we are down to 240 days of government formula. If we subtract a further 12 days for state and federal public holidays, we are down to the 228 days in the coalition formula. This seems logical, since employees generally do get annual leave and public holidays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People should know that the Greens are not in favour of encouraging more people to use cars and car parks. But, if you are proposing a formula in order to calculate what the real costs are, then the formula must be realistic. Most employees would probably use the parking less, since they would have at least one or two days sick leave. We will certainly look at these amendments and any other amendments during the committee stage to make fringe benefits tax more rational. Basically, we will support these bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is considering concurrently two tax measures: the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995 and the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill 1995. I am going to address my remarks to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995. The general outline and financial impact of that legislation is contained on page 1 of the explanatory memorandum. I do not intend to repeat that for honourable senators. It is there before them and obviously they have studied it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do want to deal directly with a couple of matters of principle in this second reading debate, and I will be very brief. Taxation legislation is notoriously complex, as has been said around the chamber by I think almost every speaker. There is one aspect of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995 which deserves some consideration against the background of what principles should be applied in taxation laws. That aspect is the proposal to eliminate dividend rebates and franking credits where dividends are paid out of accounts such as share capital or share premium accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has taken great pride, and rightly so, in abolishing the double taxation of dividends through the imputation system. Now, however, it is virtually turning its back on that because it is turning taxation of dividends on its head and is working on taxing repayment of capital as income. It is really quite bizarre that 10 years after capital gains tax was announced the government is still mucking around with the legislation because it cannot work out how to compute the cost base for shares where dividends have been declared in some form and various capital or asset accounts have been reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see how it is a neutral or equitable taxation system if, one month, a company pays $100,000 of a non-deductible amount as share capital in a subsidiary, and the next month, if for some reason&mdash;such as needing the money back&mdash;that $100,000 is returned as dividend in some form, the parent company then has to pay 36 per cent tax with no franking credit available. The amendments in part 2 of schedule 1 are really about capital gains tax and the appropriate cost base for shares after capital has been returned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of adjusting the cost base for capital gains tax, the Treasury and the Tax Office are tampering with the taxation of dividends. Instead of adjusting the capital gains tax cost base of shares directly, they have persuaded the government to make an attack on basic principles for the taxing of dividends. To my mind, this is a very serious matter because it strikes at the heart of taxing principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process, as has been pointed out in another place, the government is creating, no doubt unwittingly, considerable problems for Australian insurance companies, which must debit some of the so-called disqualifying accounts for company reporting reasons. The net result is that Australian insurance companies will now be disadvantaged as against overseas insurers who operate in Australia through branches or reinsurance arrangements and do not have to worry about rebatable dividends or franking credits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should closely examine this measure. I invite Minister Cook to address three issues. If he does not do that in his response to the second reading debate&mdash;at the present time he appears to be otherwise engaged in having a discussion with his officials&mdash;I invite him to address those matters in greater detail in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it appears wrong to attempt to correct a capital gains tax problem by undermining fundamental income tax principles against double taxation and against taxation of a return of capital. Secondly, as I have mentioned, this bill will put Australian insurers at a commercial disadvantage and push Australian insurance business offshore. I am not sure that we are being a very clever country or being very sensible in doing that. We already have a deficit problem with the balance of payments and a deficit on invisible exports such as services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Senator McMullan, the Minister for Trade, in Osaka arguing for free trade in services such as insurance. Yet here we are being asked to do the opposite&mdash;unwittingly, it appears, through the misguided tax measures that handicap our insurance industry in the race to compete with offshore insurers. That is not the total result of this bill, but that is one of the results of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can you on the one hand be acting as the Prime Minister and as Senator McMullan were in Osaka and on the other hand make it more difficult for Australian insurers to operate and give a free kick to international insurers? That is what you are doing here. It does not seem to be a sensible way of helping our balance of payments deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly&mdash;and this is not unusual in taxation legislation&mdash;it may be that these so-called anti-capital gains tax avoidance measures will not work anyhow. It is not for me or any member of the Senate to suggest how they will not work. But at least the taxation officials or the minister should have a look for clues as to why it will not work. The clues may be found in an article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canadian Tax Journal</EMPHASIS> in the late 1970s. I have no doubt that taxation officials are well aware of that article. If they are not, they should be and they should take other measures than those that are now proposed to address the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do hope that the minister, if he is not able to respond to those matters in his second reading response&mdash;and I acknowledge that he was not here when I commenced my address&mdash;will address those matters in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a range of senators participating in this debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In congratulating those who have participated in this debate, I want to say that the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill 1995 implements a package of measures that is designed to reduce FBT compliance costs for employers. These changes have been generally welcomed therefore, and not surprisingly, by employers. The government will be moving some amendments to this bill in the committee stage, and I foreshadow that now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main amendment that we will move will be to remove the proposed changes dealing with living away from home benefits. It is our contention that we should take that out of the bill. In this debate on the second reading stage, Senator Gibson asked me why the government is proposing to do this. After perusing the record of the debate, I think the senator set down a series of reasons why it should not be there and then asked why the government is removing it. His series of reasons have some resonance in our thinking. I say that without endorsing them. Nonetheless, we have had our ear cocked to public debate on this issue and want to reflect the will of that debate. It seems appropriate for us to remove those provisions, and thus do so. I formally advise that the main amendment which deals with the living away from home allowance acknowledges the substantial concerns expressed by industry groups about the effect of the present proposals and the effect that they might have on business. That is the reason for our changes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before proceeding with the consideration of the bills in the committee, I wish to make a statement about the bills and the amendments. The three government amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill 1995 have been circulated in the form of requests for amendments. It is not clear why it is thought that the amendments should be in the form of requests, but it appears to be based on a theory about taxation bills which has been put forward during the inquiry by the Legal and Constitutional References Committee into the interpretation and application of section 53 of the constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee will recall that in the context of certain taxation measures in 1993 there was a difference of opinion between the majority of the Senate and the government about the application of section 53 of the constitution to those measures. The government's advisers maintained that, although the measures increased the rates of various taxes, they did not impose taxation and could therefore be combined in one bill. Following this disagreement, the matter of the interpretation and application of section 53 of the constitution was referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. The committee has not yet reported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the committee's inquiry, a number of theories about section 53 have been put forward, particularly in relation to taxation bills. One of the theories put forward is that, where a bill does not impose taxation but a Senate amendment might have the effect of increasing the amount of taxation which would be collected by comparison with the terms of the bill, as distinct from the status quo applying in the absence of the bill, such an amendment should take the form of a request. This theory seems to be the basis of the amendments to this bill being circulated as requests. The bill is not a bill imposing taxation. But it has been suggested that the amendments might increase the amount of tax payable by comparison with the terms of the bill, although not by comparison with the status quo in the absence of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate has not had an opportunity to consider the proper application of section 53 to taxation bills and has certainly not adopted this theory which is not in accord with past practice. It would, therefore, be premature for the committee to act as if this theory had been adopted. In any case, it is by no means clear that the amendments increase the amount of tax otherwise payable. The explanatory memorandum accompanying the amendments states that the financial impact of the amendments is nil. I therefore direct, subject to any contrary determination by the Senate, that the amendments are to be moved and determined as amendments rather than as requests.</PARA>

<PARA>Amendments Nos 1 and 2 concern the income tax deduction under the proposed new section 51AEA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 for employers who elect to use the fifty-fifty split method for calculating the taxable value of meal entertainment fringe benefits.

<PARA>I think there is a drafting error in the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill which resulted from the original announcement in February. The compliance package made it clear that the car parking fringe benefits compliance issue was to be addressed in two ways. The first was in relation to when FBT applies. The second was to provide three alternative methods for determining the number of parking benefits provided during the fringe benefits tax year. The announcement in February went on to make it clear that further options would be provided for the actual valuation of benefits&mdash;that is, the current lowest fee charged by the commercial operator method, the market value method or the value of the parking space determined by a value or new average cost based on the average of a nearby commercial parking stations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the option of the three valuation method was made available for two of the three methods of determining the number of parking benefits provided, the government provided only the average cost valuation method for the new statutory formula for the FBT calculation process. By seeking to redress that situation, this amendment gives taxpayers who are using the statutory formula the same choice of the three valuation methods as taxpayers using the other two formulas. This is what you intended to do in your February statement and I wonder why you did not do it. </PARA>

The Acts Interpretation Act does require a court, in the event of there being doubt in the mind of that court, to have resort to extraneous material which may resolve that doubt. Among that extraneous material are the comments, in the committee stage of a bill, by the government minister who has carriage of that bill saying what the intention of that bill is in the mind of the government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to amendment No. 2 moved by Senator Gibson, this amendment is being moved because some concern was expressed about the amendments affecting rebatable and frankable dividends.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the exemption proposed in paragraph 46J(3)(b) will apply in such a case. This is because the reduction in the carrying value of the asset and the charge to the asset revaluation reserve, although achieved in two stages, does give effect to a reduction in the value of the asset.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think this particular amendment is necessary. Following discussions I have had with Senator Margetts, I think the confusion could have arisen not from a publication from the Taxation Office but from something that came from one of the subsidiary departments, maybe Primary Industries. I think the legislation is quite clear. If I could just quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Butterworths Australian Tax Handbook</EMPHASIS>:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A taxpayer who carries on a business of primary production on any land in Australia is entitled to a deduction for certain capital expenditure incurred for the purpose of combating land degradation. In respect of expenditure incurred after 21 August 1990 the deduction is also available to a taxpayer who carries on a business, other than primary production, mining or quarrying, for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income from the use of any rural land in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expenditure which qualifies for the deductions as set out in s 75D(1B)&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">expenditure incurred primarily and principally in preventing or combating land degradation otherwise than by the erection of fences on the land . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So it really comes back to an issue of land degradation. Because there has been some doubt, I think it is desirable to make a couple of contributions on the value of limestone and lime in combating land degradation in Australia, which is so important. Limestone is a basic essential to Australian industry. While it might also be used in the manufacture of glass, plastic, paint, rubber, aluminium, cement, et cetera, by far the major usage of limestone in Australia is for agriculture. It is the major source of calcium in the treatment of acid soils, and that is where it relates to land degradation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, because of high rainfall or utilisation for cropping or animal production, much of our nation's soils are naturally acidic. Degradation by high acidity is a widespread and gradually occurring problem, and reduces the productivity and output of agricultural soil. Because of its gradual nature, high acidity is often referred to as the unseen landcare problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any time produce is removed from the farm, lime is reduced. For example, the baling of a hectare of lucerne hay removes approximately 250 kilograms of lime from the soil. Animal production is less destructive of lime content, but also has a marked effect. This means that farmers must work to replace the lime in their soil if it is not to become too acidic and lose productivity as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Modern high technology testing processes allow farmers to determine accurately just how acidic or alkaline their soil is and what other nutrients may be needed to maximise their output. Farmers, therefore, are able to accurately apply and supplement their soil with very little guesswork or the waste of earlier days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I really want to make is that, unlike some other fertilisers which need to have annual applications, the lime content is a long-term management issue with applications usually necessary only every three to 10 years depending on soil type, rainfall, zone and the type of production. Perhaps the writer of the publication that Senator Margetts referred to may have thought that, because the limestone was irregularly applied rather than annually applied, it had a capital nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the capital nature, I think the wording of section 75D is quite clear&mdash;that section 75D also applies to capital items. The particular reference you had was talking about section 51, which has a recurring nature to it. There is another specific section which I think should also have been referred to in the particular application that caused you just concern. It is very important, and I am pleased you raised it, because it has enabled us to clarify this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to take this opportunity of pointing out that I think it is quite reprehensible that the government has removed the diesel fuel rebate for those people who manufacture lime for agricultural applications. These two things certainly go hand in hand. It has certainly given us another opportunity in another area to air our concern about the removal of the diesel fuel rebate from the manufacturers of lime for agricultural purposes. As we have mentioned before, this will raise the price of lime by between $1.60 per tonne to perhaps $2 per tonne. That will vary. It could be a bit lower depending on the types of applications that are used to extract that limestone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to impress on you, Minister, that you should discuss with your colleagues further the need to come back and have a look at your government's intention to remove the diesel fuel rebate from the production of limestone. I do not think it is necessary to proceed with Senator Margetts's amendment, because I think there is adequate protection in section 75D. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, starting right at the basics, it is the government's intention to provide a tax incentive to combat soil degradation in Australia. Our broad view is that that is the most serious environmental and ecological issue for this nation; thus, there is a provision in the act to encourage that via a tax incentive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that work has now been done under the auspices of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy&mdash;and I think the CSIRO participated in this, too&mdash;which argues that liming in certain circumstances is a proven and valuable combating agent for soil degradation. The issue at contest is whether we should amend the tax act to specify this new insight or whether it is covered by the existing words in the tax act. I will read my formal advice into the record shortly but, in essence, it underlines and corresponds with the advice that Senator Watson read into the record and spoke to a moment ago. The bottom line here is that the existing act covers it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point is that we are looking at words here that confer a benefit and which may be subject to litigation, although I must say that I think it is quite clear here. While I do not think there is a likelihood of litigation, there is always the possibility of it and one has to guard against that possibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention this in a cautionary way. When a settled set of words which specifies specific things are changed, the tendency in legal interpretation is to regard the whole text as being limited by those items that are set out. Thus it may be that, if an amendment were made here, it could have the reverse effect to what is intended. I do not say that it will&mdash;I am not giving a legal opinion here because I am not competent to do so&mdash;but I do make that observation under the heading of `let us be careful about how we proceed here'. This is just a cautionary note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to my advice: this amendment is related to measures in the bill. It adds further words to paragraph 75D(1B)(c). The proposed words are wholly unnecessary. The paragraph is part of the section that gives deductions to those who carry out primary production or other business using rural land for a variety of capital expenditures on the fighting or preventing of land degradation where they are in that business or in a business related to that. It gives deductions for operations primarily and principally for the purpose of preventing and combating land degradation other than by fencing, which is dealt with in another paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts's proposal refers expressly to operations to apply limestone or other soil agents designed to address soil acidification, salinity, or other forms of soil degradation on the land. Such operations are already covered by the plain words of the existing paragraph. Senator Margetts does not propose to deem all liming or other dressing of land to be an operation primarily and principally for the purpose of preventing or combating land degradation. Whether it is or not, not all dressing of land is meant to fight or prevent land degradation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The words of Senator Margetts's amendment add nothing to the law, and so can do no good. The words may obscure the meaning of the law and, if so, would do harm. The government does not oppose the purpose that Senator Margetts wishes to support; the government opposes an amendment which will not help and may, in fact, hinder that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That concludes my advice. But to put this matter beyond any doubt, I refer to the letter that Senator Margetts has had leave to table. It is a letter from the Commissioner of Taxation, dated 16 November 1995, to a Mr River, one of Senator Margetts's advisers who is situated in Parliament House. The letter is signed by Mr C. L. Hood, Assistant Commissioner, Business Tax Branch, Australian Tax Office. Senator, I suggest that you incorporate this letter. That would put the advice of the department on this point as well in the record. It is yours to move on; it is not appropriate for me to do it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating two higher education funding bills&mdash;the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1995 and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. The first of these bills we support. This is really an omnibus bill dealing with a range of different subject matters. Probably the most important part of it is the introduction of cooperative multimedia centres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that instance, we suggested changes in the debate in the other place so that there would be the capacity for research and development to be incorporated within the purposes as defined for the centres. I am pleased that the government accepted our suggestions and amended the bill before it reached the Senate in that regard. The major issue of concern we had in relation to this bill has now been rectified. The first bill, as I said, we support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second of the bills is a bit more difficult. Part 1 sets out the revised funding levels of grants for operating purposes, superannuation expenses, open learning organisations, teaching hospitals and special capital projects. These are relatively marginal increases and we do not oppose those amendments. Part 2 provides a 15 per cent discount in respect of voluntary payments of $500 or more in discharge of certain HECS and open learning debts. We do not oppose that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of the bill redefines taxable income for HEC assessment purposes. We do not oppose that. Part 4 of the bill makes provision for a discount to be offered to persons who voluntarily commence to repay their HEC debt when their income reaches $20,000. Currently, the level at which the debt must commence to be repaid is $26,853. We have some reservations about this in light of the government's record in relation to HECS. Of course, this was the `no up-front fees' government at one time. It seems to have modified its position on a number of occasions over the years. One of the modifications was the introduction of HECS so that students are now obliged to pay a share of the cost of their undergraduate course. Certainly, it is by a deferred system so that they repay that debt when their income from employment subsequent to graduation reaches just over $26,000, as I indicated a moment ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, one would say that the voluntary right to commence repayment at a lower income seems to be rational and sensible, but as this government since the introduction of HECS has had the habit of seeking to increase the percentage that is repayable by students&mdash;in other words, extending the obligation of students&mdash;and also reducing the threshold at which they must commence repayment, one suspects that if this government is re-elected a voluntary payment to commence at $20,000 will soon become a compulsory repayment to commence at $20,000. It is not surprising that student unions have also been expressing that concern. So we have that reservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also some worry that students may well get themselves into financial difficulty by accepting this invitation and seeking to repay the debt before they are economically sensibly able to do so. I think that is relatively unlikely. But we do have reservations about the provision because of our concern that this is really the first step towards the government's intention of reducing the threshold at which repayment must commence. Nevertheless, we are willing to address the provision in the terms in which it is put before us. At the moment it is voluntary and we will not oppose it. But we do express the reservation that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, students are concerned because of the government's poor record in this regard. The government makes promises one day and breaks them the next. Students are as disillusioned as the rest of the Australian community in relation to this government's performance. Of course, there is another option&mdash;that they support us and we get elected; we will keep our promises and they will be better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 5 of the bill provides three new repayment thresholds for HECS. This is a demonstration of the validity of students' concerns. What the government is doing here is breaking another promise. What it is doing is inserting three new levels for repayment that has the effect of obliging students to accelerate repayment of their HECS debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the government is not increasing the debt, but it is requiring students, depending on their incomes, to repay earlier. We have taken the view that this is a compact between students and the government. Students entered into higher education on the basis that they would accept an obligation to pay a portion of the costs on a certain fixed basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is the government unilaterally determining to vary the repayment basis to the students' disadvantage. It is not surprising that students are upset by this. They have every reason to be upset because the government has broken the compact that it entered into with them. We believe that the government should stick to the agreements it reached with students in the past and keep the promises that it made to students in the past. We do not see why this provision should be supported. We will vote against it as it applies to existing students or past students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a different issue in relation to future students; however, it is again a broken promise. The government keeps promoting the no up-front fees rhetoric. Future students know the basis upon which they enter higher education, including the requirement for accelerated repayment of their HECS. In relation to existing and past students, we believe it is a blatant abuse of students. In effect, it is in the spirit of another tax. This is an accelerated payment to get the money in earlier. It is a promise to students that has been broken. We will stand by the students' interests in this regard and will not support this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 6 of the bill provides no discount on HECS contributions for students who are required to pay up-front fees. That amendment is consequential on the introduction of mandatory up-front fees, which is an issue tied into another part of the bill that I will get to in a moment. Part 7 of the bill provides for projects concerned with maintaining and enhancing innovation to be funded by way of a national priority reserve fund. We do not oppose that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 8 eliminates HECS exemption scholarships for the professional development of teachers. I, along with my political colleagues from across the spectrum, attended a breakfast this morning with representatives of the Australian Education Union. Those people who represent the teaching profession were stressing to us not only the importance of education for the benefit of Australian students but also the importance of the proper status and recognition of the skills of teachers within the sector. We have to address the government's decision to eliminate a particular type of scholarship that would offer further professional development to teachers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lot of teachers has not been easy, particularly during the recession we had to have, which was inflicted upon us by this Labor government. The social consequences of a million people unemployed and the record levels of family breakup provide pressure points for teachers. Obviously, a great deal of extra pressure was put on the teaching profession arising out of family stresses. Teachers have found it a difficult lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of having to cope with these increased pressures arising from the recession, the challenge of teaching has become ever more complex. More is continually expected of teachers&mdash;and one thinks of the expanding obligations, for example, in relation to vocational education. We all support students staying longer at school, but it is necessary in the post-compulsory years that there be sufficient educational choice in order that the educational product presented to students is relevant to their skills and aspirations, which is the need for a broader range of educational opportunity. Again, the pressure is put back on teachers to respond to this. Of course, it means they need to respond in areas in which they may not have had training, so the need for further professional development is obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the traditional educational areas, science immediately comes to mind. Science is changing so quickly&mdash;information technology, for example, is changing so quickly&mdash;that it is extremely difficult for teachers to maintain the level of professionalism that they would wish without having the opportunity for upgrading their qualifications and skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in that environment we find the government has made a decision that the HECS exemption scholarships for professional development of teachers should be scrapped. Since the introduction of HECS in 1989, some 4,000 HECS exemption scholarships per year have been made available for professional development of teachers employed in Australian schools. So, for a saving of $4.82 million, they are to be scrapped. I think that is regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 9 is, I guess, the most controversial part of this bill which has upset a lot of immigrants in Australia. This is the attempt by the government to change the entitlement for getting the benefit of a HECS education system for permanent residence, which is the test at the moment, to citizenship. In other words, with a phasing-in period, it will only be Australian citizens who can get this benefit, whereas in the past it has always been a test based on permanent residency. As a matter of interest, according to the DEET figures, I understand there are currently some 26,000 permanent residents studying at Australian universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has promoted this as an anti-avoidance mechanism. There has been an argument that there are some who come here as permanent residents, take the benefit of the Australian HECS education system&mdash;in other words, one that is predominantly publicly funded, with a contribution by students on a deferred basis&mdash;and then leave the country without taking employment here and repaying the HECS debt. I suppose it is pretty obvious that they may well do that whether they are permanent residents or Australian citizens but, nevertheless, the government has assessed that it is more likely to happen in relation to those who do not go on to be citizens. It is, therefore, planning to change the test, as I said, from permanent residency to citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has not been the normal practice in relation to the granting of Australian benefits to base those benefits on citizenship. In fact, I think most of us would like to think that citizenship is something to which new Australians aspire, not just for reasons of what material benefits might flow from it but, rather, because they wish to be Australians in the terms of Australian citizens and to contribute to our community to the full extent of normal citizenship obligations&mdash;commitment and citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government is seeking to do here is really quite new. In fact, we might argue that it is almost forcing permanent residents, in effect, to become citizens by the threat that unless they do so they will not otherwise receive a benefit that other Australians will have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It flows from what I have said that we have considerable misgivings about the argument that the government is putting and the precedent that it is creating. It is not surprising that the representative groups of Australians who are not citizens have argued strongly against this. Again, a number of student interest groups have also argued strongly against it and pointed out particular examples where students will suffer. An example, which I notice is picked up in one of the Australian Democrats' amendments, is where a student's country of birth is unwilling to accept dual citizenship and therefore there is loss of access to return and the relationship with their family may flow as a consequence and the student therefore suffers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have decided to draw the line again at the point of those who came to this country and became permanent residents on the understanding of the existing arrangement. We do not believe that they specifically should suffer as a result of the changes that the government is imposing. Therefore, when it gets to the committee stage, we will seek to amend this bill to remove them from this proposed change by the government, which we think will be a just solution in all the circumstances. It does not answer all the worries that I have. It is something of a compromise, I acknowledge, but, nevertheless, it is a reasonably fair and just solution for those who are particularly disadvantaged by the change that the government is proposing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats certainly have misgivings about this higher education legislation, the purpose of which seems to be no more than to arrive at a greater amount of revenue for the government from adjustments to legislation which is in force in Australia. As such, it is a continuation of strategies which have been attempted before and a continuation of an attitude which sees Australian students as a potential source of income for the government. This is a group of people who have been targeted before as having been the source of what the government has previously described as bad debts and people who have been seen before as a source of different opportunities for the government to get in the money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in this chamber before several examples of the government trying to rearrange things so that it can get the money in faster or get in more money in total. On several occasions in this chamber we have expressed our opposition to such measures. We are here again forming somewhat of an alliance with the coalition, the Greens and other independents in this chamber to oppose these rearrangements. Sometimes this alliance has worked and at other times it has not. I hope that on this occasion we in this chamber are able to sufficiently draw the attention of all honourable senators to the inequity that has been introduced by these proposed changes and the unfairness that it would visit upon Australia's student population and the community in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill was right to draw attention to the fact that these proposed changes have received opposition from various parts of the community. The correspondence I have in front of me now&mdash;from which I will quote shortly&mdash;expresses that opposition. It is becoming somewhat annoying to have to come into this chamber yet again to defend the position which I would have thought this government would have stood for; that is, maintaining equity for students who are following what they thought the arrangement was. But yet again the government is initiating a change which is, using the cliche, moving the goalposts during the game. It is annoying to have to use that cliche to refer to what the government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This argument is accurate, and I cannot see why we should have to repeat it. Nevertheless, we have the argument and I repeat our opposition to the changes which are being foisted upon Australia's students. I want to give an example of the correspondence that I have received on this, and I am sure that other senators have as well. On 12 October this year I received a letter from the National Union of Students which says in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With reference to Part 5 of the Bill, NUS is concerned at the continuing trend of increasing the burden placed on students, and past students, through changing the rates at which repayments are made. NUS feel that, despite the claimed merits of the changes, the constant tampering with the repayment conditions of HECS fees is unfair on students who have already incurred a debt.</PARA>
<PARA>That says it simply. I would like to hear the government's reason and the government's rationale for bringing to people with whom it has made an agreement a change such as those proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to quote further from the correspondence so that the Senate has the benefit of knowing exactly what the students of Australia are saying through their national body. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NUS is more gravely concerned by Parts 6 and 9 of the Bill regarding up front HECS fees for Permanent Residents. NUS feels that this is the most regressive policy change contained within the Bill and as such the most important section to be removed, or amended. This change constitutes the introduction of up front fees for undergraduate domestic students and strikes at the core of issues of access and equity. This change is by no means the first step toward the introduction of up front fees for Australian undergraduate students, as this process has been occurring for the last decade. This change could be more accurately described as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">last</EMPHASIS> step before up front fees for Australian undergraduate students, as the Government has few other categories of students to target.</PARA>
<PARA>The government can deny that. The government can say that they do not want undergraduates to be charged up-front fees but the fact is that, under the regime that the government has established here, those trends are occurring. That is what is happening. Although I hear the minister constantly saying that the government oppose such moves, universities in Australia have found ways to effectively do this, and here we have the government taking steps which, for some students, will mean up-front fees will be charged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot blame students for getting the message that a certain trend is occurring even though the government is denying that it can occur. If on the ground and in reality that is what is occurring at the universities, do not blame the students for thinking that the reality is in fact what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other correspondence I have received on this legislation includes a letter from the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia. FECCA writes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you are aware, Australia's multicultural policy is based on the principle of inclusiveness and therefore is a policy for all residents of Australia. The exception to this principle to date has been the denial of Social Security benefits to newly arrived migrants for a period of two years. The proposed changes to Austudy and HECS are further exceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">FECCA contends that these three exceptions are creating two classes within Australia&mdash;residents and citizens. FECCA would hold that such a division is at odds with the development of multiculturalism and detrimental to our relatively harmonious community relations record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, FECCA would assert that the spirit behind the proposed changes, which links financial incentives to citizenship, is at odds with the appropriate promotion of citizenship as an active voluntary commitment.</PARA>
<PARA>If that group perceives that is how the government is doing things we should recognise that perception because they are the people who are the subject of the government's movements. We should understand what affect those movements will have directly upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another piece of correspondence I received on this matter was from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. I received this the day after the minister received a little publicity over his claim that the stated position of the Australian Democrats and the coalition on this matter would cost the government a certain amount of money and that that amount of money would be denied to the tertiary education sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be a coincidence that the correspondence came to me. I suspect it also went to Senator Hill. That correspondence came to me at the same time as the publicity about the minister's assertion that there would be certain costs associated with it. I note that the AAP placed a low priority on the report that the Queensland minister reacted to this threat from the federal minister. I note also that the publicity that the minister was able to achieve on this is quite small. From the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee I received correspondence which said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the Government's statement that the budget for Higher Education was budget neutral, and subsequent discussions with the Department of Employment, Education and Training indicate that this will result in either reduced places for new students and/or reduced funding for research infrastructure. In the budget lead up these were the system's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>presumably, the tertiary education system's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">top priority for funding and so the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee is very troubled by the amendments which have been prepared without any consultation with the AVCC or universities.</PARA>
<PARA>My reaction is to say that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee's letter and the discussion with DEET about where this money was coming from or going to beg several questions. I would like to raise those questions here at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the questions derive from the assertions made by the Queensland Minister for Education, David Hamill, who issued a press release which said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Thousands of final year students throughout Queensland are this week writing their applications for positions at our universities in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"They were doing this in the knowledge that 1,700 more students would be accepted following the successful negotiation between the Goss and Keating governments earlier this year . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He thought that many dreams may be smashed by petty party political games in federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions which arise from the AVCC correspondence to me and from the statement by the Queensland minister are, as far as I am concerned, basic questions. I wonder whether the negotiators were told that these extra places relied upon greater returns from HECS to the government. I wonder whether the negotiators asked the government how it would find the money. Did the government tell the negotiators that it did not have that money in hand but was hoping to gain this money from the payment of HECS liabilities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether during these negotiations the government reminded the AVCC and the Queensland minister that HECS liabilities are repaid only when certain income thresholds are reached? I wonder whether the negotiators considered that forcing people to become citizens would magically place them over these income thresholds to start returning this money to the government? I wonder whether the government explained during these negotiations how this extra money would come to pass if everybody actually obeyed this new legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the purpose of passing legislation is in the expectation that people will actually comply with it. If everybody to whom this legislation is directed actually complies with it and becomes a citizen of Australia under the provisions that Senator Hill has so adequately described, I wonder whether any extra money will come the government's way anyway? Presumably you bring legislation in here with the intention that it will be something to which people will comply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On what basis do we have these precise figures that are quoted? In one piece of correspondence I have here we are told that in 1996 the government will receive $11.7 million; in 1997, $18.7 million; and in 1998, $19.4 million. Upon what basis can the government seriously make these claims that this extra money will be available and that it will be sufficient to fund 1,750 extra places in Queensland universities? On what basis are we supposed to receive this threat that unless we agree with all this we will somehow be responsible for such moneys not being available?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government wanted to recognise the need for these extra places, then surely it would be providing the funding on a much more sound basis than a vague assertion that there will be so many people not complying with the legislation, and therefore having to pay fees up front, and that that money will be available to the government. There is not much of a leg to stand on there. I will be very interested to hear the government's explanation of where these extra funds have been calculated and on what basis and what they are going to do if everybody complies with the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anticipating that that will not come about, I will be moving in the committee stage on behalf of the Democrats some amendments which will again oppose changes to HECS. That is consistent with our position we have maintained ever since the higher education contribution scheme was introduced into Australia. Having had it introduced, we have consistently opposed any changes to it and we will do so again. I will be moving amendments which seek to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will also be moving amendments which will seek to ensure that certain categories of students will not be affected by the changes with regard to the citizenship requirements. Certainly, for that considerable number of students who are under 18 years of age, it seems to us to be grossly unfair that somebody who is under 18 years of age should be penalised in anyway for not becoming a citizen. That seems obvious to us and that is our first priority here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our other amendments will seek not to disadvantage a citizen of a country which does not permit its students to hold dual citizenship; not to disadvantage somebody who is applying for and waiting conferral of citizenship; and enable the minister to have some discretion to recognise a particular situation where a student may be suffering extreme hardship. I will be moving those amendments in the committee stage to give effect to our position that this concept introduces inequities and unfairness. We see there are unfair aspects of this legislation to which the government has not paid sufficient regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill also gave details with regard to part 8. We need to recognise that the effect of these provisions would be to remove the exempt scholarships from professional development for teachers. As I understand it, the government proposes to fund such applications from teachers from what is virtually the leftovers of university funding in other categories. I have seen no evidence that the government is meeting that funding requirement in any other way. It may be redirecting teachers to a different source of funds for professional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the government is not ignoring teachers in need of professional development. As I said, it is directing teachers to another source of funding but I have seen no evidence that it has increased that source to provide for teachers who have been so directed. To continue the theme, from the point of view of people who are living in reality, they see a cut in funding because that is what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you blame teachers who are offended, upset and disenchanted with this trend? The psychological effect is to wipe away any respect the government has had for their professional development. I am offended by that. I am offended by the suggestion that it is not worth investing in the professional development of teachers. This legislation has offended a considerable number of participants in higher education. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the government in the other place has accepted the coalition's amendment to incorporate research and development into the definition of these centres. However, I remain concerned about another aspect of the proposal by the government and that is the establishment of these centres under the education portfolio. I question whether this is the right way to go. Perhaps they should be more closely aligned with the information technology area, given the way they might develop over the next few years and the very vital role they will play in the development of this very rapidly expanding industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that they come specifically under the control of DEET. DEET has a record of being very interventionist and this would be yet another tentacle of the DEET octopus. The work of these centres in service and training, and in R&amp;D for the multimedia industry, could be hindered by DEET if it follows the centralist approach it has taken in many other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to question whether the vast and cumbersome DEET bureaucracy will treat these centres in a way that will enable them to flourish and grow. Given the key position we are now in and the advantages we now have with the development of information technology compared with many other countries, it is vital that this very new area is nurtured properly. I express some concern about whether this will happen under the aegis of DEET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second bill is the main one we are considering today. It contains two very controversial measures which have been alluded to in some detail by Senators Hill and Bell. The government is introducing under this legislation three new HECS repayment thresholds and the requirement of permanent residents who have not taken out Australian citizenship to pay HECS charges up front. Senator Hill has foreshadowed amendments to bring fairness and equity to this legislation. From comments so far by Senator Bell, I think we can fairly safely assume that the Democrats will support those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are moving to amend the bill so the government's three repayment thresholds will apply only to those students who commence their studies from 1996 onwards. Labor is trying to extract more money from over 800,000 tertiary students yet again. This is the second time in the three years since the last election that the ALP government has tried to accelerate HECS repayments. I was very much involved in the education area before the last election and listened to what the government had to say in its policy back then. I can't recall any statements or any whisper that the government was going to change, fiddle or increase HECS at all. I would ask all students right around the nation, before they cast their vote in the next election, to very much take this into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can't really trust what this government says or what it does not say, the things that it does not reveal, because it has certainly had a secret agenda in terms of extracting more money from students in this term of government. There was no hint of it before the last election. But the record of what it has done over the last three years now stands exposed. Students should consider that very carefully before casting their vote in the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the arrangements this government has made since 1987 for the funding of higher education, particularly student contributions, students in this country now have an accumulated HECS debt of $2 billion. The government is very anxious to reel in as much of this as possible as quickly as possible. That is why it keeps changing the ground rules. This creates great uncertainty for parents and students right across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you undertake a course of study, particularly one where you do have to pay fees over a number of years, you should be certain about what your financial commitment is at that point. Particularly for people who are not well off, they must know what the ground rules are and, one would hope, have some security that those ground rules will stay right through their period of study. The basic principle is that each cohort of students should start and finish their degree under the same rules. But it is not so under this government. Every year we see they keep chopping and changing the rules for their own financial convenience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition amendment will introduce a degree of financial certainty for students who undertake courses in the future. It will protect current students and undergraduate students from the Keating HECS grab, none of which, as I mentioned, had been foreshadowed before the last election. The ALP government is also targeting another group in this HECS grab. The government wants this bill to amend the law so that permanent residents who do not take up Australian citizenship have to pay HECS up front. It requires permanent residents who have met the residency requirement for citizenship one year or more before enrolment to pay up-front fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure is aimed at stopping persons from overseas undertaking education in Australia and then leaving the country without paying their HECS debt. The coalition amendment will have the effect of making this apply only to permanent residents who undertake studies from 1996 onwards. This is in line with the sound principle that I outlined earlier. Students should start and finish their degrees under the same set of rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to DEET there are 26,800 permanent residents studying at Australian universities. Of those, only 2,200 would be liable for up-front fees under the government's plan. Most will take out citizenship in Australia. Over half would not have been permanent residents for three years and would therefore have the right to defer their HECS debt. The government's estimate that in 1995-96 it will save $1.8 million and $3.8 million in the following two financial years is a very dubious projection. As Senator Bell commented in his speech, the government has said that this money will be used to fund places in universities. He also stated that the government is holding a threat over the opposition parties that we will be responsible in some way if we amend the bill and do not allow this plan to go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out very strongly to everyone involved that that $1.8 million, and subsequent $3.8 million, is very dubious in its calculation. If you look back to the number of students who will not have to pay the debt by the various means that I have already indicated, the sum will be that much lower. But, of course, we will not know that until after the next election. So the government has really developed a furphy here. There will not be the funding available to fund those other places. If the government plans to do that, it really needs to work out a different mechanism for bringing that about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition believes this amendment will in only a very small way address the problem of rorting the system, which the government claims is the rationale for the legislation in the first place. It is possible to complete a degree as a permanent resident before becoming eligible for citizenship, and the government amendment would not have any effect on this. For those whose nation of origin permits dual citizenship it would be easy to become a token Australian and then return home, paying no debt at all. So a great number of groups will not be caught by this net that the government is setting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have before us is a proposal that is very cumbersome. There are some possible savings, but in reality probably very little at all. We feel the coalition amendment probably makes the best of a bad situation. It enforces that basic principle which I outlined earlier. People have some security in their future financial planning under our amendment. It gets rid of the sense of retrospectivity that is included in the proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP's HECS grab which we have been discussing and which is embodied in this bill underlines the government's underfunding of the whole higher education system. It is the government's latest pathetic attempt to squeeze more money into a system that it has grossly underfunded since the disaster of the Dawkins reforms eight years ago. The Higher Education Council and a research committee of the AVCC have nailed the ALP government on its university spending record over these years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 1 November this year reported that Minister Crean has been forced to defend the government's record in the light of the reported findings that recurrent per capita funding for students has declined by seven per cent since 1983. I will just repeat that point: since the government came to power, the funding for each student is seven per cent lower than when we left government. That starkly highlights what this government has done over its 13-year stewardship of the universities. It has made the funding base poorer off and therefore has threatened quality right across the system. It just has not put enough money into the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AVCC Acting Executive Director, Mr John Mullarvey, is quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> story as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the first time the government has come clean and conceded its operating grant per student has decreased.</PARA>
<PARA>This underfunding is affecting teaching, research and university administration right across the country. Financially, universities are under great stress. There is overcrowding in lecture theatres and poor library and research facilities. This stress on university infrastructure, having been caused by underfunding, will continue to be produced as a result of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill hopes, in some small way, to try to get just a little more money in to overcome this gross underfunding. But it will not have much of an effect. As a matter of fact, on our calculations, it will hardly change the bottom line at all. Also, it is creating a form of injustice against these students. This legislation highlights, yet again, the failure of this government's higher education policy and the inadequacy of its funding mechanisms which over the last 13 years have been developed by the government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating two bills here today: the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. The first bill, funding bill No. 1, is a general funding bill which increases recurrent funding grants to universities, and provides funding grants for teaching hospitals, capital projects and cooperative multimedia centres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 5 allows greater ministerial powers for approving moneys for any institution. It sets up funding structures which may be positive if we are talking about funding increases. But it allows flexibility in funding, according to the whim of the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also allows rewarding systems of tertiary institutions research priorities, for instance, which the Greens do not necessarily agree with. It allows for responsiveness to whatever the government's funding priorities happen to be at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are some concerns with this bill. There are also possible areas of contention in relation to subsection 35(5). This section allows for students in jointly funded industry places to be exempt from HECS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess it is more a watching brief that we are holding on this. We do not, in the end, know what the impact will be as to the places available and the effect of making certain courses exempt and others not. We do not know whether the impact will mean that there will be a greater level of control of industry in connection with what goes on in our university system. So, as I say, in that case we, the Greens, will be looking more closely at those issues and keeping a watching brief on any resulting impacts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 does a lot of things, such as providing for funding&mdash;as does Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995; introducing discounts for voluntary repayments; removing the discount for up-front HECS payments; and redefining taxable income for HECS assessments, and so on. However, this bill also brings in some dreadful measures against which, since they were announced in the 1995-96 budget, students have been campaigning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are, firstly, bringing in the new voluntary HECS repayment threshold of $20,000. At the moment you only start repaying HECS once you earn over $27,000. To claw more money back faster, the government is selling a lower threshold as a voluntary repayment scheme&mdash;which it is, until you make the first voluntary repayment. It then is not voluntary any more, and you are locked in for good. We will be seeking to amend this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, this second bill removes the HECS option for New Zealand citizens and Australian permanent residents, replacing it with up-front fees; although they are not full fees, they are still at the HECS rate. The government should come clean about this. It is a revenue raising measure to force 27,000 students into citizenship, which would be a windfall in the demanding of birth and citizenship certificates. There is an irony here: we do not limit taxation liabilities in Australia to those who are citizens, and it is fair enough to provide a requirement for length of residency; but it is amazing that people can be fully required to pay tax for years and yet be considered in a category of not being able to receive any of the benefits of those taxation contributions on the basis of their citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a revenue raising measure, as I said. Universities themselves will find the whole process administratively unworkable. Universities fear that they will have to verify every one of Australia's 550,000 students for Australian citizenship, including those born in Australia or permanent residents who have been resident for more than three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monash University researchers have found an unexpected twist to all of this. Students who have taken out citizenship can prove their status by showing their certificates to the university or Austudy authorities, but those born in Australia may face problems. They claim that this is because neither an Australian passport nor birth certificate states that a person is an Australian citizen. The only proof is a statutory declaratory certificate of Australian citizenship, which costs $55. Therefore, state governments are likely to receive a financial windfall for issuing birth certificates and extracts of entry while the Commonwealth could earn a fortune providing new passports and citizenship documents. This came from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> on 11 July 1995, page 49. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monash researchers looking at the impact of this policy say that the thought of up to 550,000 applicants for certificates of some sort is a sobering one. It will be an enormous inconvenience and cost to students who will need their proof of citizenship by February 1996 when these changes, if passed, are due to come in. I would appreciate some response from the government on these claims by the researchers at Monash University. There certainly appears to be some dispute over the level of documentary evidence for Australian born citizens, but this does need to be clarified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the government claims that those 27,000 students can just become citizens and they will not have to pay up-front HECS. However, there are many of these people whose former countries preclude them from accepting citizenship of another country. Yet they want to retain dual citizenship so they can keep up their family relationships and cultural identity. Some of the countries that do not accept dual citizenship are Austria, Malaysia, Germany and Chile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to my questions to the budget estimates committee, I was told that 2,200 students would refuse to give up their birth country citizenship and will therefore be affected. It is from these 2,200 students that the government hopes to claw back around $12 million until the year 2000. If so few students are being attacked for more money at such a high administrative cost, the question needs to be asked: why bother? It should also be noted that the government's rationale is to target its education benefits at students who have a `demonstrated commitment to Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to question this fundamental point because can citizenship really be seen as a demonstrated commitment to Australia? Out of the 27,000 permanent residents affected, more than one-third have lived in Australia for 10 years or more. They have clearly demonstrated their commitment and are unlikely to flee the country. Someone who has been here for less time could change to Australian citizenship and flee the country anyway or revert to their former citizenship and still leave the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This policy decision is a knee-jerk response from the government that allegedly wants to prevent rorting by permanent residents who finish their education in Australia, go straight back to their home countries to work and avoid paying their HECS debts. There are other ways of solving this problem such as appointing guarantors for the debt, as with any private debt for people who may be returning home within five years of completing their degree, for example. These possibilities need to be explored. If the government has other ways of doing that, perhaps it might suggest those as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the bill introduces additional HECS repayment thresholds for income levels between $30,000 and $51,000. The $27,000 first compulsory threshold level will remain at three per cent but, instead of rates at three per cent, four per cent and five per cent, there will now be intermediate rates as well of 3.5 per cent, 4.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent for the top income earners at $51,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens have no problem with progressive taxation of the highest income brackets. However, we do not think it is fair to burden new graduates with high rates of repayment on average incomes when the financial burdens of life are at their greatest, for instance, with children and mortgage commitments. Also, we think it is very unfair for the government to have increased HECS three times in the last two years. That means that someone starting a degree first undertook that degree with a commitment that repayment rates were two per cent, three per cent and four per cent. They were promptly raised to three per cent, four per cent and five per cent and now to three per cent, 3.5 per cent, four per cent, 4.5 per cent, five per cent and 5.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason we will be moving a second reading amendment to get the government's commitment to hold down these repayment levels for the next triennium, for the future budget years 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99. We hear a lot about certainty in this place but often those people who are influenced by government decisions and clients are the ones who do not get certainty. Student groups have been trying to get such an undertaking from the government and the opposition. This may be the most effective way of getting the different sides' commitments on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention that students and tertiary lobby groups have been blackmailed, effectively, and put in a situation where the government is threatening them with HECS increases or a loss of increased places for 1996-97. In no way should these groups accept the government's hollow threats. The government's lack of commitment to providing places in line with demand has already been demonstrated. In no way is such a measure dependent on revenue from another budgetary measure. This is plain nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is part of the government's tactics to cut money from budgets wherever it pleases and substitute it with user-pays systems. Its commitment to full access to public education has been exposed as rhetoric when you have a government looking for excuses as to how to make cuts and make students pay more. There are plenty of sources of revenue for the government to provide higher education places. It is the government's priorities with this revenue that have gone awry. I therefore move the following second reading amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)notes that Higher Educatio Contribution Scheme (HECS) thresholds and repayment levels have now been raised by the Government for the third time since the inception of HECS;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)further notes that, although students have undertaken degrees with the understanding that they will be liable for a certain amount of debt, payable at certain rates, the Government has changed the circumstances of this arrangement many times; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)therefore calls on the Government to give an undertaking that, in view of the proposed amendments in items 17 to 20 of Part 5 of the Schedule of the bill, neither the HECS thresholds nor the repayment levels will be increased for the next triennium, that is at least until 30 June 1999, to give students certainty in their financial commitments with the Government".</PARA>
<PARA>This is somewhat self-explanatory. It is designed to provide students with some degree of certainty. As others have indicated in the debate on this bill, the government is continually changing the goalposts with respect to HECS and the repayment thresholds. This is creating some degree of difficulty. It is also, to some degree, one of the reasons for a decline in demand for university places. I trust that the Senate will support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the debate on matters of public interest today to speak on a matter of great concern in this country and that is long-term unemployment. Several weeks ago, the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee tabled a report into long-term unemployment. It revealed the absolutely disastrous situation facing people in this country, some of whom are amongst the most disadvantaged, in terms of what is now happening in the job market right across the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a Labor government that has been unable to grapple in any meaningful way with the scale and dimensions of this problem. The problem involves not just economic dimensions. We lose an enormous amount of productive capacity because up to 20 per cent of the work force are not fully engaged in productive and financially rewarding work. We also have a situation where special groups in society are devastated by the effects of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment. The groups that seem to be most disadvantaged by this are the ones that are least able to defend themselves, particular those young and mature age people who find that their skills are no longer relevant in a rapidly changing work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very high social and economic cost of long-term unemployment. Today, and in a series of speeches over the next two weeks, I want to highlight the plight of those people and also the terrible implications for the Australian economy and society of sustained levels of long-term unemployment, which under this government have risen steadily over the last 13 years. There has been a minor decrease in recent times because of the boom but it has not been to the extent that the government has indicated. We are now seeing that part of the economic cycle change again. We are now heading into a time of further increases in long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response to this social disaster we have on our hands has been grossly inadequate. The whole foundation of the so-called Working Nation program&mdash;and what a laughable title that is, because large numbers of Australians are not working&mdash;was to make people job ready. If you look at what the government has done to this economy over the last 13 years, you find that people can be as job ready as they like, but there is no work for them. People in Wollongong kept telling us that they have been trained and trained again and we have the best trained dole queue in the world. It is the failure of this government's policies that has created that situation. If you are going to train people it must be related to work. It is no good continually churning over the dole queue. This makes the government's unemployment figures look better, but it leads to total despair for the people involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Working Nation report was scrutinised by our committee over a period of several months. What we found was that the programs that had been set up to solve the problems of long-term unemployment over the last year and a half are not delivering effective workplace training regimes that lead to sustainable work for the long-term employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cruel hoax of Working Nation is that it leads battling Australians to realise that this Keating government is not really the Labor Party of yesteryear. Labor has changed; it has become very complacent and smug, thinking that it has successfully hidden this problem away from the Australian people. The plight of the long-term unemployed is off the agenda of this government. It is the purpose of this series of speeches to really highlight to the Australian people that this is still a major problem facing the country and that the government has to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their response to date with their labour market and training programs has only really had the aim of concealing the real level of long-term unemployment and the pain that is creating for people. In the run-up to the next election, you can see why they would want to conceal their disgraceful record in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of Quantum Harris confirms that there is deep unrest about the direction of the Keating government in this area and in many others as well. Fifty-four per cent of respondents, despite the government trying to cover things up, have revealed that they think ALP policies are on the wrong track. Sixty-one per cent describe this Keating government as tired and say that it is time for a change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is issues like long-term unemployment in the fringe suburbs of our cities and out in rural and regional Australia that are causing this unease and unrest. It is not just the unfortunate long-term unemployed that are suffering now. Parents of today's teenagers fear for the job prospects of their children. Today's school children could be tomorrow's long-term unemployed people under the current policy regime of this ALP government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee report is full of evidence from Australians who fear that the government's programs, including so-called Working Nation, cannot deliver.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have an honours degree and three post graduate diplomas and was employed in the field of personnel management for 20 years. Like many others I could not believe that if one wanted a job, one could not find one. Having failed to get a single offer, I now know what it is like to be on the scrap heap of the unwanted.</PARA>
<PARA>We heard evidence very similar to that right across Australia. In regions like the Hunter and the north coast of New South Wales, youth unemployment rates are a disgrace at 38-plus per cent. My previous quote related to a long-term unemployed person who is mature age, but the other side of that coin is the long-term unemployed who are young. One expert witness dealing with long-term unemployed youth said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . young people are slipping between the cracks of society . . . spending days and weeks watching TV, sleeping and withdrawing from society.</PARA>
<PARA>Children are also growing up in families where no-one works. At page 36 of our report, there is this quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By the middle of 1994 there were 703,900 children aged 0-14 years growing up in families where no parent is employed.</PARA>
<PARA>This was the social landscape of the Great Depression in the 1930s. In many areas of this country we are still in that sort of great depression still. Many areas of Australia have not recovered from the recession that Mr Keating gave us in 1990. He talks about economic growth on an overall average across Australia. There are some hot spots of growth in Australia&mdash;central Sydney, central Melbourne and some of the mining areas. But across the vast landscape of Australia most areas are still back in the last recession. We heard the voice of despair from the people in those areas as we moved across the regions of Australia over the time of preparing this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This voice of despair for the long-term unemployed comes out in not only affecting their social situation and their employment situation but also their personal situation, particularly as it relates to health. In the area of children's health, page 38 of the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The area of health shows clearly the intergenerational effects of long-term unemployment. Children of unemployed parents had 25 per cent more serious chronic illnesses, were injured more often and were more likely to suffer deafness than the children of employed parents&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Long-term unemployment has a devastating impact on men in our community. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For males aged 25 to 54 mortality rates for the period 1985 to 1987 were 17 per cent higher than for employed males.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Aboriginal communities, which have an average unemployment rate of 30 per cent (though for some it is as high as 80 per cent), the suffering from health problems is extreme.</PARA>
<PARA>The scope of the despair felt by so many classified as long-term unemployed was presented by a witness from a welfare action group to the committee. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of the long-term unemployed have basically given up.</PARA>
<PARA>What I have presented today is a window on the level of despair presented by the long-term unemployed. The ALP's answers to these that they have developed over 13 years are not working, as evidenced by what we heard in every area of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take up other matters relating to the long-term unemployed in future matters of public interest debates, in particular the failure of the Working Nation programs, the problems that still exist with the case management system and  the destruction of jobs in the small business community. After 13 years of driving policy, this window on long-term unemployed despair should stand as a disgrace to the ALP&mdash;a government that has really given up on this problem. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) is on duty in the chamber today. During my speech outlining and quoting those heart-rending cases, he continues to read the paper. I think this just shows the attitude of this government and the reason why in this next election they should be thrown out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to respond to an attack that was made upon me by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), an independent member from Western Australia, in the House of Representatives a day or two ago. I assume it was an attack designed to cast him into the role of martyr again and, therefore, attract martyr votes. I do not intend that Mr Filing put a statement down in the House of Representatives relating to me which is without truth and have it go unanswered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Filing refers to a meeting held earlier this year between John Howard, myself, Eoin Cameron and Paul Filing. Mr Howard had asked me to attend that meeting because Mr Filing and Mr Cameron were very concerned and vocal about their preselections and much of their unhappiness could be alleviated by discussing their preselection with them. That was at least Mr Howard's hope. Mr Howard began the meeting with a short introduction. I got straight to the point by asking Mr Cameron which branches and which delegates had I directed or indirectly influenced to vote against him. I asked him also which branches had changed preselection delegates in the last 12 months, except his own branch at Doubleview, where he, his family and his employees had rolled the president. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, he was unable to name one person or one branch. He then began babbling about the leader's representative in Western Australia at state executive and state council. In the end, when he continued to obfuscate about the issue which caused the meeting, I had to remind him of the purpose of the meeting and I used the words, `You are now only using up oxygen and the leader's time.' `We are here to hear your concerns about your preselections,' I went on to say. I then turned to Mr Filing, after despairing at getting any sensible answer from Mr Cameron, and I asked Mr Filing the same question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He began by saying that he could not discuss it because he had received legal advice, and then he lost me in some talk about his expulsion or some such thing of which I had no knowledge. I then pressed him on the subject at hand, and the best he could finally come up with was that I had some influence with the Young Liberals. I responded that no-one, least of all me, was capable of controlling the Young Liberals in Western Australia. The meeting finally ran into the sand and, when Mr Cameron and Mr Filing left, I said to Mr Howard, `Do you now see what I've been saying?' He responded that, yes, he had noted the response of one of them in particular, and I took that to be a particular reference to Mr Cameron. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within 24 hours, a bodgie and untrue story was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> by Mr Tom Salem, which is alleging to reflect the accounts of the meeting. But of course it did not. I am most certain that that story did not come from Mr Howard's office. I reminded Mr Filing during the meeting that the state president of Western Australia had spoken to every branch president within his division, including all his own supporters, and all had denied any lobbying or communication by me. It seems to me that Mr Filing has sought to transfer the branch's and the division's disapproval and unhappiness with him onto me. Of course, he is the sort of person who cannot carry his own responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other matters Mr Filing canvassed. I have not got the time to read out what he had to say in detail, but perhaps my response will make sense to those who have an interest in this matter. Mr Filing also claimed that at the meeting he raised the fact that he had received a copy of the minutes of the state executive of the Western Australia Liberal Party, and there was mention in them of an expulsion or suspension motion against him, and that that particular document was an effort to undermine his standing in the Western Australian Liberal Party immediately preceding the Moore preselection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He claims that he pressed me at the meeting about those minutes and that that was a blatant attempt, as he calls it, to undermine his standing in the party. He said that the senator&mdash;referring to me&mdash;who had been at the meeting which these minutes came from said that he had no knowledge of the particular matter in question because he must have been distracted. As it turns out, I certainly had no knowledge of them because the matter that he is referring to did not take place at the state executive. I could only imagine that at that stage, because he was so certain of what he was saying, in fact I had missed part of the meeting. But I certainly had no memory because that matter to which he referred did not take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say this now that Mr Filing has raised the matter: the matter in fact arose, as I recall, from the party's constitutional and drafting committee because of their inquiries about Mr Filing's conduct. The essence of that inquiry was that Mr Filing had scrutineered an internal party ballot in which he had a vested interest because the results included delegates to be elected for his preselection. I have always thought it was pretty dubious practice, scrutineering your own results, but, be that as it may, he did. He took the results from the returning officer, the then state director, Mr Hook, who was quite new at the task, and Mr Hook, in his innocence, asked Mr Filing to pass the results on to the divisional secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no judgment about it except to say that by the time the results had got to the divisional secretary, they had significantly changed, much to the benefit of Mr Filing. That caused a member of the constitutional drafting committee&mdash;I assume, as a result of a complaint&mdash;to make inquiries and prepare a report, which he did. The report was of so much concern to me, given that Mr Howard had previously raised the question of the prospect of a motion of the nature outlined&mdash;that is, a notion of censure, suspension or expulsion of Mr Filing&mdash;that I did undertake to keep an eye on things. I was so concerned about that document that I rang a member of the leadership group, together with forwarding him a document, to say that I was very concerned, I did not want to find myself compromised nor the party compromised by my efforts to smooth the waters. I also conveyed my concern in a more general way to the leader, but I did not want him drawn unnecessarily into a matter which might cause embarrassment to the party in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, be that as it may, I accepted the request of Mr Howard to have the matter resolved and the state executive proceeded to accept Mr Filing's explanation, much to my concern, although I make no secret of the fact that I was one of those people who was instrumental in accepting his explanation. That did not satisfy some of the executive, including the lawyer who had prepared the document. He asked that his vote of dissent and his disapproval of our accepting the explanation be recorded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the substance of the matter to which Mr Filing refers. I would have thought he was very unwise to have raised it and to have suggested that, in some way, I had some responsibility for the matter appearing in the minutes. I understand that the drafting and constitutional committee of the party prepared, or were contemplating preparing, a set of words. Under our constitution, the words to be used for disciplinary proceedings are `censor', `suspension' or `expulsion'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise one other matter. Mr Filing refers to a telephone call apparently held between me and Mr Wade Smith, who is presently the member for Wanneroo in the state of Western Australia in the Legislative Assembly. Mr Filing claims that Mr Smith told him that he, Mr Smith, had received a telephone call from Senator Crichton-Browne in which Senator Crichton-Browne said that he, Mr Filing, had been getting far too much influence in the branches of Moore division and that he, Smith, ought to sort it out or get a kick up the backside from me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, that was the first time that I had heard of this conversation. I took the liberty of ringing Mr Smith yesterday. He said that this was not the case at all. He said that the conversation had occurred as a result of a phone call from Mr Smith to me. Mr Smith reminded me that I had said that he, Mr Smith, ought to make sure that his branches were well looked after and in place because it was his preselection on the line. I said that, if a member of parliament, whichever House he was in, did not look after his branches, he did not deserve to be re-endorsed. There was no reference to Mr Filing at all, although Mr Smith told me that he gratuitously offered advice to Mr Filing that I was in no way active in the federal seat of Moore and in no way was I seeking to influence any of the branches. As I said earlier on, at my request, the state president of the party had contacted all the branch presidents within that division. They had assured him that I, either directly or indirectly, was seeking to have no influence on the preselection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it does Mr Filing's cause any good to present a story which does not in any way coincide with the facts. It seems to me that he has been invited to do so because of the document which was tabled by me on 15 November, which he says makes false, misleading or just plain wrong assertions. In particular, he refers to the meeting with Mr Howard. To the extent that it is suggested that that document incorporated by me is incorrect, I felt obliged to respond to Mr Filing and I have done so in a very gentle, pleasant and fair way. If I disclosed the details in more robust and detailed circumstances, there would be a great deal of embarrassment for Mr Filing and it would seriously jeopardise the goodwill of any reasonable voter in the federal seat of Moore. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise again today to speak on a matter that I first mentioned in the adjournment debate the other night, to the amusement of some senators, I believe. I spoke about the problems associated with the use of gambling by governments as an increasing source of revenue. I hope that, as I spoke of some of the issues which have been raised in many quarters, those people who were amused began to understand some of my concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I want to do today is to place on the record some more of the evidence, which I think is important, and to underline the fact that, when governments use gambling as a means of revenue&mdash;increasingly state governments have been doing that&mdash;they ought to take account of the fact that there is a very real social cost involved with the gambling industry. If governments were more prepared to allocate some of the tax revenue gained from gambling in areas such as education about the risks involved, counselling of those who get caught up in the abuse of gambling and rehabilitation, then I do not think I would be as critical as I am, for at least that would be a recognition of those costs. Unfortunately, governments are quite happy to take the revenue gained without at all recognising the costs involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quote from a friend of mine whom I have supported for many years, the Reverend John Tully, who runs a counselling and support centre on the Gold Coast for street people and particularly for gambling and other addicts. His organisation is called New Life Ministry at Street Level. Mr Tully has for many years worked in this area, with some support from the church and individuals like me but often with very meagre resources. Despite the fact that he has worked for years and years in this area, he has never been about to get from government any support in financial terms for the work that he does, despite the amount of revenue which is raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a press release which he put out a little while ago he speaks about the need of the pathological gambler. He says that gambling addiction is a recognised mental illness like the condition described in psychiatric literature since 1980. He says:</PARA>

The articles mention the fact that losing gamblers may be depressed, angry and more accident prone and the fact that children had been left alone at home and at the casino while parents and guardians are gambling.

In controversial circumstances Crown has already been granted permission to make extensive changes to the permanent casino and they now wish to extend the temporary casino. These processes have been consistent with other Victorian Government activities such as the Grand Prix acquisition, the changes to the health and welfare systems and the introduction of regressive industrial legislation. In a climate of minimal consultation the public feels powerless to affect the outcome of Government decision making. The government has moved to silence the voices of opposition by limiting the power of independent authorities to which it has been traditionally accountable&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>If governments are going to increasingly use gambling as a means of raising revenue, they must be responsible and use some of that revenue to rehabilitate, counsel and support those who are caught up in the abuse of gambling. Of course, I recognise that not everybody is. However, the Victorian Synod of the Uniting Church has reported in recent months that welfare agencies and financial counsellors have reported a rise in the number of problem gamblers and the problem gambler telephone counselling service is being inundated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has made much of various programs to encourage the arts. Its big statement earlier this year about what it was doing about the arts, and in particular encouraging arts education, seems to have not been entirely successful. That is a polite way of putting that some areas, quite frankly, have had a raw deal. I am particularly concerned about those areas of arts education which, under the government's program, were to receive particular and special attention. Unfortunately, in some areas the special attention has been to downgrade the government's contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have here a letter dated 18 September 1995 from Mr Simon Crean, Minister for Employment, Education and Training, to Mr F.S. Hambly, Executive Director of the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee, which establishes a weighting of publication data for the 1996 composite index, which significantly downgrades the creative works in the area of the arts in terms of what kind of weighting they should get for funding and other purposes. This is, I believe, an indication of the government's lack of concern for an area in which it claims to have real concern. When it comes to handing out the money, and when it comes to providing the real support, we find out what the facts really are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee has recommended to the minister that these weightings follow a regimen. To me, that seems to unfairly advantage some written research as against creative works. For example, it has recommended that a book with authored research should get a weighting of five but that a major written or recorded work should get a weighting of only one. I think that is bad enough. That suggests that poor old Beethoven would get a rating of one whereas someone who writes a book about him would get a rating of five. That strikes me as fairly absurd but the Vice-Chancellor's Committee has in fact recommended that. However, the minister thought poor old Beethoven was worth even less so he changed it so that a major written or recorded work has a weighting of 0.4, as against a weighting of five for an authored research book on Beethoven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that it is extraordinary when one looks at the definitions to see that my whimsical reference to Beethoven is not unreasonable. This is what a major written or recorded work is described as. The definition refers to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A substantial creative or scholarly work such as a novel, long musical work or play separately bound and offered for sale under the imprint of a recognised commercial press or publisher or recorded on CD, video, et cetera, for commercial distribution. Musical works in this category would normally have a duration of at least 20 minutes in playing time and dramatic works a duration of at least one hour. Also includes scholarly, analytical and descriptive catalogues such as for major international art exhibition catalogues.</PARA>
<PARA>But here we have artists clearly set up as second-class citizens in terms of weighting for research purposes as against authored research into a book. I do not know on what basis the minister decided further to downgrade the weighting for other creative works, but it does seem to me to be extraordinary. Not only do we have an authored research book weighted at five, we also have articles in a scholarly refereed journal. Just an article rates one as against 0.4 for a symphony or a play&mdash;which has to be at least an hour&mdash;or, in fact, a novel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it can be argued that there are other areas of funding for these matters. There may well be, but what disturbs me is the clear, uncomplicated discrimination against creative work in the weighting of publication data for the universities. This seems to me to be absolutely absurd. Even an article&mdash;in other words, something far less than an article&mdash;to a scholarly refereed journal gets a weighting more than writing a symphony does. You can put out computer software&mdash;this also has been downgraded, by the way, from one to 0.4&mdash;but computer software rates the same sort of weighting as does writing a symphony or a play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, this whole thing disturbs me, particularly in the context of the evidence given in the Senate's excellent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Arts education</EMPHASIS> report&mdash;a report by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communication and the Arts References Committee which was presented to the Senate last month. I modestly say that I am a member of this committee and that I am quite proud of the report. The report deals with the relative funding model for university teaching costs, which, once again, represent, in my view, a downgrading of the arts and discrimination against the creative arts which is grossly unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the report says, the relative funding model was devised in 1990 with the purpose of discovering whether any universities were significantly underfunded or overfunded in their Commonwealth operating grants. The university subsidies were divided into 21 disciplines and the cost of teaching the various disciplines was assessed by means of three teaching cost studies. The disciplines were grouped into five clusters, the members of each cluster having similar costs, and the clusters were given different weightings. The weightings were multiplied by the student numbers in the various clusters in each university to give a notional teaching cost for each university that could be compared with the university's actual grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, this was done for a specific purpose but the consequences were significant because the universities have tended to use them as the basis for splitting up their money internally. The sets of weights were calculated. Some examples of the undergraduate weightings are: accounting, economics and the law, one; education and maths, 1.3; computer, nursing and visual performing arts, 1.6; engineering science, 2.2; agriculture and medicine, 2.7; and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arts educators who have appeared before our committee are unanimous in condemning this model. They say that there is a serious imbalance in the allocation of resources within universities between science and the humanities, that is, arts and culture disciplines. This imbalance has its origins in the arbitrary DEET decision regarding the weightings of different disciplines for the purpose of funding allocations for universities. This different weighting flows through to departments within universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the real problems is that in the arts there is a much more direct relationship between teacher and student in the creative arts. In music, for example, you may have a situation where there is a one on one relationship between the teacher and the student, whereas in a lecture room dealing, for example, with history there may well be one lecturer to 200 or so students. Certainly when I was at Sydney university that was the situation. So it is unfair and discriminatory against those performing arts or plastic arts that are now a part of the university system as a result of the Dawkins arrangements. It is now grossly unfair that they are relatively&mdash;in my view&mdash;underfunded in relation to the specific needs they do have of a much tighter student-teacher ratio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that so far the government's great objectives which, in its great statements about the arts, it said it was supporting in the area of arts education seem to me not to have been carried out in the actual activities, in what the government is actually doing. I believe the minister has an obligation to explain why on earth creative work such as a major written or recorded work is worth a weighting of 0.4, when a book that is written about that creative work can get a weighting of five. Clearly the government is prepared to talk about supporting arts education. It is a pity it does not do something more about actually funding it appropriately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to refer to two matters, if I get the opportunity in the time available. The first matter is forests. The government will next week announce the results of the deferred forests assessment process&mdash;a process which forms part of the flawed national forest policy. It is likely that the outcome of this DFA process will be another disaster, in the long litany of disasters for Australia's forests, for the timber workers and for the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The processes that the federal government has established to deal with the forest debate are incapable of reaching a solution because they are fundamentally flawed in the principles they work from and their approach. The Greens have always been critical of the national forest policy and we are also critical of the deferred forest assessment process that has been born out of that policy. The national forest policy does little to protect our magnificent native forests and it is little wonder that the DFA process emanating from it will not provide any solution to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first problem with the deferred forest assessment process is, as I mentioned, that it is part of the national forest policy. In that policy what we are looking at is the preservation of forest type museums or exhibits, because we are looking at what is called the CAR reserve system: areas that are found to be comprehensive, adequate and representative of the original forest of the south-west of Western Australia will be preserved in reserves. That `representative' nature is a big trap, as is the word `adequate'. If we really value the qualities of our forests we ought to be preserving all of those we have left before their inevitable destruction and disappearance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deferred forest assessment process is exactly that: it is deferred rather than protected. That means that, even though the assessment is being deferred for a fuller assessment, there is no protection for those areas from the eventual possibility of logging and from use by the woodchip industry. </PARA>

It is simply deferring the capacity for it to be protected. It is an ongoing battle for those who already believe those last remaining forests have to be protected, so it should not ever be a pretence that it is being protected.

They are not locked up for anybody else; they are kept for the community and for the future. They are only locking out those who would want to log it and destroy it. So, in that sense, it is being preserved for the public rather than being locked up for any particular section of the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in Western Australia is extremely bad in relation to the state Department of Conservation and Land Management. CALM has been obstructionist and uncooperative in terms of actually setting aside areas that need to be protected from the intrusions of the woodchip industry and from logging. It has tried to interfere with the independence of the scientific advisory panel and to coerce the Commonwealth forest task force into including at least parts of some of the non-statutory zones in the reserve system. CALM has consistently withheld essential information from the Commonwealth, in relation to the process in Western Australia, except where it suits them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a myriad of other examples, but I will just cite one in a letter that has been transmitted to the forest task force by the Bridgetown-Greenbushes Friends of the Forest. The letter points out that there has been a rapid deterioration in the integrity of the deferred forest assessment process, and that the concerns regarding CALM's involvement in that process have not been able to be addressed. I will seek leave at a later point to table this letter because it vividly illustrates some of the problems that have been experienced. I will table it at the end because I am running a little short of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, we also are aware in Western Australia that the submissions from that side of the country are not fully understood by people on the east coast because the species that we have are unique to that part of Western Australia. We started off, at the time of colonisation and European settlement, with two per cent of Western Australia as forest&mdash;we now have one per cent. Any attempt to try to set up a reserve system of 15 per cent of what is left, of what was there at the time of colonisation, is going to require the protection of significant areas of karri and jarrah and other mixed forest types. That is not being addressed by the current reserve system that is being developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until we develop a process which is based on a set of clear and agreed principles, operating in the best interests of the community, then we will not reach a solution to the acrimonious forest debate. The government needs to bring all the pieces together. It needs to listen to all the interested parties in the debate, including the depth of feeling in the general community. The government must act to protect the forests, and not simply keep deferring their protection; to protect the timber workers, by setting up transition strategies so that they can phase in plantations which are already there as a feasible alternative; and to protect the future forests for our children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current process will not do that and I challenge the government to look seriously at adopting one that will.

In recent months, Senator McKiernan has, on a number of occasions during the adjournment debate, commented on the issue of asylum seekers in Australia. I am seeking to respond to some of those comments. It is an issue that has occupied a great deal of Senator McKiernan's attention, particularly since he became the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. It has also occupied a great deal of my time. As is so often the case in this place, senators may spend time on the same issue but they may have utterly different perspectives on the issue, as is the case with Senator McKiernan and myself on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent history of boat people in Australia has been one of tragedy and is likely to bring shame on Australia in international fora. We have certainly not lived up to the humanitarian ideals which we espouse as a nation. We have not even lived up to the standards we set during the late 1970s when another wave of boat people came to our shores seeking our assistance after the fall of Saigon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have commented many times on the extraordinary difference between the climate of welcome nurtured and created by the then Fraser government and the hostility which has been the hallmark of the current government. Australia is presently maintaining a double standard where we allow bridging visas to the extremely high numbers of visa overstayers, over 60,000, but we penalise the relatively smaller number who seek the asylum of our shores by imprisoning them. At the moment, I think we have about 800 people in detention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not arguing, and I do not think anyone would argue, that Australia has to accept each and every person who comes here seeking refugee status. My own position has been that the assessment process should take its course. However, when the course taken detains young children and families who could, after a brief assessment process, be held in the community, we have to wonder whether what we are doing is humane or very punitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government seems to me to have created a climate of punitiveness. When its own processes have failed, it has sought to imprison people and to validate or justify that position. When that has failed, it has again tried to use the parliament to achieve what it has not been able to achieve through its own assessment processes and through the legal processes. I am sure that we can all recall the shameful legislation brought in to declare the illegal detention to which some of the boat people were subjected as being legal after the fact. Similarly the $1 per day compensation legislation, which is not likely to pass from peoples' memories quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case of the Ngep brothers was also referred to in this place. I believe that Senator McKiernan criticised the brothers because, in spite of the fact that they had been rejected four times, they still wanted to appeal the decisions that had been made to deny them their stay in this place. Of course, that has taken an interesting turn and I hope that Senator McKiernan has noted it. He may well want to comment on it in the future. The brothers have now been granted bridging visas to allow them to live and work in the community while they seek to go to the United States to be reunited with their family who were able to gain residential status there much earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, I am led to believe that this was an out of court settlement agreed to by the government. I can only speculate about what advice the government received to encourage it to short-circuit the legal process, but I am delighted on their behalf. Mind you, to spend five years of their teenage life in custody, with the consequent damage that that will cause, is not something that they will be able to get over quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legal and legislative processes are only one part of the saga. More important is the human story. Senator McKiernan, like Senator Bolkus, makes a great deal of the fact that the people being held in detention centres could go home at any time. We are told time and time again that these people are only being held because they will not take up the option to be free. I suppose that makes good copy for media and helps to foster the image in the community which the government wants&mdash;that these people are simply here out of greed or opportunism or perhaps because they thought it would be a good idea or a way of getting free food and board. If only it were so simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that people do not leave their ancestral homes without good reason. They do not embark on a hazardous journey in dodgy boats without reason. They do not subject their children to danger without good reason. People flee danger. They flee situations in which they believe they are in danger, and they are prepared to subject their children to the rigours involved in such an escape bid only if they believe that the situation they are leaving is too perilous for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McKiernan criticised people in the detention centre for putting their children through the trauma of being locked up. I do not believe we can do that unless we also criticise the government. The policy of the government to release children only if it is in their best interests and not to allow their parents to be released into the community with them is a policy that contributes to the trauma of any children who are locked up in this country. I herald with great joy the commission of inquiry that is going to be held by the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Chris Sidoti, into the detention of children at Port Hedland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude my remarks by saying that I commend Senator McKiernan on his willingness to go to China with some of the people who were repatriated and for his staying with the issue. I just wish that he would refrain from denigrating anyone who does not share his view and I hope that our different perspectives can be reconciled at some point.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I commend you on the great restraint you have shown from the chair. The matter that I wish to raise today as a matter of public interest is the plight of the apple industry in my home state of Tasmania and also right around Australia. Indeed, at this very moment, even as I am on my feet, there is a delegation from Tasmania meeting with the federal Treasurer, Ralph Willis, to see if he will change his mind concerning the announcement he made, on 2 November l995, of the imposition of an excise tax on apple cider. The announcement, ironically, was made in Hobart, which is the capital city of the state that grows the most apples. He had been in Tasmania but had not bothered to consult with the community. He did say when he was in Hobart that he was not likely to change his mind about that issue. I hope that those people from the apple and pear growers and also Cascade Beverage Co. who are meeting with the minister at this very moment will have an impact on him to make him change his mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of this is that the federal government held an inquiry into the wine industry, whether an excise tax ought be applied to the industry, and decided that an excise tax would not be applied. But out of left field comes the announcement by the federal government that it will, instead, impose an excise tax on the cider industry. There has been no consultation with the growers, no consultation with the industry and, might I add, no consultation with the ACTU. I have a letter dated 16 November 1995 from Max Ogden, the industrial officer for the ACTU, to Mr Quinn, General Manager of the Cascade Brewery Co., which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can quote us as being in support of our position and I will draft a letter for Martin Ferguson to send to the Treasurer expressing our concern.</PARA>
<PARA>Basically, these are the actions of a tired, stale, completely arrogant government. It does not think it has to consult with the trade union movement, with the growers or with the industry. It just decides to tax the apple industry, hoping that it will not affect too many people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that there are 3,600 apple growers around Australia. Sure, a large part of those are within my home state of Tasmania, but the industry that is affected starts off with 3,600 apple growers around this nation. These growers are the epitome of small business. They are virtually all family enterprises where people have worked very hard to make a living. It not only impacts on farmers; it also impacts on the beverage companies such as Cascade in Tasmania, which makes apple cider. It has an ongoing effect for companies such as ACI, the glass manufacturer in Moonah&mdash;a northern suburb of Hobart&mdash;which would have increased its glass production and its bottle production in the event that the cider industry got a better deal and was able to expand as had been planned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, all the government is likely to get in extra revenue, as an absolute maximum, is $3 million. I would suggest that it is more likely to be $1 million or $2 million. However, if that is the benefit, let us look at the impact on 3,600 apple growers and all the beverage companies around Australia that had been operating on the basis of no excise. Why impose an excise tax on apple wine but not on grape wine? Is there some health reason or social policy reason that says that the alcohol in grape wine is more dangerous and more potent than it is in apple wine or apple cider? Of course, there is not. It is once again a cheap political move by the government as it tries to raise more money for itself because it knows that its budget forecasts are way out of kilter. The forecasts were shonky from the beginning and now, in the run-up to the election, which is being deferred and deferred, the figures are looking sicker every day and worse by the week. The government is trying to get some extra revenue, but what is the cost going to be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to realise that the impact of the decision will be substantial job losses in the Tasmanian apple industry and, more specifically, in the Huon Valley. I compliment the Liberal candidate for Franklin, Les Glover, on the stand he had at the Huon Show last weekend. I know that Senator Sherry saw it because he was down there and took a large walk around it so as not to be confronted by it. Of course, a lot of the residents there signed a petition opposing the cider tax. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research undertaken in the last week by independent market research and economic analysts show that the price increase of about 28 per cent due to the imposition of excise will result in a sales decrease of cider in excess of 33 per cent. Another 45 per cent will modify their buying habits. This huge reduction in cider purchases would have an equiproportional effect on the manufacturers' demands for apples, with a net reduction in revenue for the Tasmanian apple industry. Of course, there are then the flow-on effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian apple industry has, over the past decade, re-emerged as a major horticultural export industry for Tasmania. Investment amounting to more than $50 million in new apple plantings, cool storage and packing equipment has ensured further substantial growth over the next five years. Production is set to exceed 80,000 tonnes by the year 2000. This re-emergence of the Tasmanian apple industry has been strongly supported by other federal government initiatives. On the one hand the government is spending taxpayers' money in trying to assist the industry, and on the other hand the government is trying to cut it off at the knees by imposing a tax which will have the exact opposite effect. One really has to wonder how well coordinated this government is in determining its policy. The government helps and assists the industry on the one hand and then tries to tax it out of existence on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the government talks a lot about the need for export earnings, especially from South-East Asia, I remind the government that the resurgence of the Tasmanian apple industry means that the new export markets which have been established in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and other Asian countries now account for over 90 per cent of the exported apples. The Tasmanian apple industry accounts for 70 per cent of Australia's export tonnage and one particular area&mdash;the Huon Valley in the electorate that Mr Glover will be representing after the next election&mdash;is responsible for 55 per cent of all Australian exports. This development has seen unemployment in the region decrease from a huge 16.7 per cent under Labor's stewardship to 10.6 per cent this June, so the apple industry is of vital importance to this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To underpin this successful export program there needs to be a viable secondary market for non-export grade apples. This market is estimated at 20 per cent of the fresh fruit crop and it is heavily dependent on the cider industry. If one takes away the monetary returns from the second grade apples that can be achieved through the cider industry, then you really do gut the whole apple industry. The net return to growers from cider apples plays an integral role in their ability to compete in international markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conjunction with the investment in the apple industry, a parallel investment program by manufacturers has been undertaken. The excise on cider is a tax on the export apple industry of Tasmania and will result in substantial job losses. I urge the federal government and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to listen carefully to the calls by the Liberal candidate for Franklin, Les Glover, to reverse this decision. If the Treasurer does not want to listen to Mr Glover, he should at least listen to Max Ogden from the ACTU, the Cascade Brewery Co., the growers and the 3,600 apple growers around this nation. I recommend to the government that it change its policy in this very important area and I urge it to do so. </PARA>

Why won't the government distance itself from these hopeless romantics of a bygone era who, in their desperation to hang on to power, have failed to come to grips with a much more intelligent and performance orientated work force? Hasn't yesterday's statement by the ACTU leader simply exposed her as one of Labor's major obstacles in its fight for political survival?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The so-called ideologues of the ACTU have delivered, in cooperation with this government, more advances on the industrial relations front and more capacity to advance on the economic front generally than has ever been the case in the history of this nation. The well-deserved reputation that we had a decade or more ago for industrial strife has utterly dissipated, utterly disappeared, as would be readily apparent to anyone who travels around the region and talks to business people and others who have been so assiduously conscious of that status in the past and have been promoting their concerns about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been an extraordinary performance of responsibility by the trade union movement over that period, and it is one that should be recognised for what it is and not assaulted. Of course, the price of that responsibility, so far as the union movement is concerned, is a willingness on its part and a determination on its part to continue to fight for the right of the trade union movement to properly represent ordinary working men and women and not to see the capacity of the trade union movement to do that and the capacity of people to collectively bargain be eroded. There is no doubt that what was going on with CRA was a very deliberate attempt&mdash;a sophisticated attempt but a very deliberate attempt nonetheless&mdash;to undermine that particular whole structure of the trade union movement and the system of wage justice in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt about where the opposition stands on all this. It has been made abundantly clear on many occasions over many years. You want to abolish compulsory arbitration. You said it in 1992; you said it on multiple other occasions. You want to stab the IRC in the stomach, according to Mr Howard in 1992. You want to tackle it head on, remove absolutely its capacity to perform the kind of dispute settling role that the IRC, the commission, played last week and also undermine the capacity of that system to deliver wage justice.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a fundamental gap all right in this country, as there is a fundamental ideological divide. That fundamental gap or ideological divide is between us, the trade union movement and men and women of goodwill in this country who understand what these basic principles are about and you on the other side who are absolutely pledged to assault those principles in a way that is absolutely unacceptable and absolutely counterproductive in terms of the outcome it would have and its capacity to produce the kinds of economic gains we have seen over the last decade.</PARA>

Obviously, we all welcome&mdash;certainly, we do on this side; I don't know about Senator Alston&mdash;this very encouraging news that we all hope will bring down the curtain on a bitter conflict that has dragged on for over four years, with many of its worst excesses played out on our television screens in a comprehensively appalling way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While all the details of the settlement are not yet available, the agreement reached will see Bosnia-Herzegovina preserved as a single state with a united Sarajevo as its capital.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement also provides for the return to their homes of all refugees and displaced people, for free movement throughout the country, and for the full cooperation of all three countries with the international investigation and prosecution of war crimes and violations of humanitarian law&mdash;an extraordinarily important element in the agreement. It provides equally for the prohibition of indicted war criminals who refuse the orders of the War Crimes Tribunal holding appointed or elected office, and provides for human rights monitoring by an independent commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The peace package also contains the agreement reached between Croatia and local Serbs on 12 November for the peaceful reintegration of Eastern Slovenia, which has been a part of Croatia that has been under separatist Serb control since 1991. The overall agreement is scheduled to be signed in Paris in early December and then it has to be put into effect on the ground. An important element of the settlement in this respect is its provision for the deployment of a NATO-led peace implementation force, which is to be sufficiently strong to deter attacks against it and any conflict between the parties on the ground.</PARA>

Is it prepared to make redundant up to 400 workers both at sea and on land, or will it continue to meet, from taxpayers' money, any and all losses incurred by ANL?</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3768" SPEAKER="Crowley Sen The Hon R.A." NAMEID="ZF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="FAMILY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very often it is good news that I am prepared to announce in this place. But telling about progress in Western Australia in child care is a very disappointing story indeed. In fact, the national child-care strategy was signed by both the Western Australian and Commonwealth governments in 1992. Since then, and certainly since the Liberal government has come into office in Western Australia, there has been absolutely no progress at all of the national child-care strategy&mdash;absolutely none.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good case could be made for there being delay in New South Wales and Victoria, however, because both of those states did not sign this strategy until very much later. But as for Western Australia, Minister Roger Nicholls has taken over a portfolio with a strategy having been signed between the Commonwealth and the state for him to proceed with. Since then, he has portrayed very little enthusiasm at all for proceeding with the building and establishing of child-care places of whatever sort. The Western Australian government stands out for its total failure to participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been happening is that Minister Nicholls has requested some variations on that strategy and the agreement between the Commonwealth and the state, and I have been very prepared to agree to that. Indeed, I suggested that we could meet his needs for a variation in their contract and at the same time get on with the business of planning and getting ready to establish those child-care places. But what happens is that, when we pass back to Minister Nicholls our concessions regarding his request, he then makes another one. So I am pleased to say to the Senate that today I have forwarded to Minister Nicholls variation to the agreement for his signature, with the request and the urgent hope that we should now be able to proceed with the establishment of child-care places in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, families in Western Australia have been missing out very significantly. The Commonwealth has gone ahead and fully implemented and funded all the 940 day care places; they have been fully Commonwealth funded, and we have been able to do that. But there are also 940 long day care places outstanding; that is about 20 new child-care centres. There is a desperate shortage of them. There certainly have been many requests for child-care places from Western Australia, including 1,200 places for care outside school hours. Families, communities, local government&mdash;all sorts of people&mdash;are desperate for child-care places to be established in Western Australia. But nothing is happening because of Minister Nicholls's refusal to participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The really interesting thing is that I have received letters from Minister Nicholls himself pleading for child care in the state of Western Australia. `Would we mind,' he asks, `assisting with the needs for child care by establishing family day care places?' Yes, Minister Nicholls, we are very prepared to do our bit. But it is about time that the Western Australian government played ball on a strategy that is in place but which is short at the moment of providing 940 child-care places to families in Western Australia. The pleas, as I say, come from everywhere. There are requests over and over for those child-care places. Yet Minister Nicholls is not prepared to go ahead with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know and feel very concerned that, every time the minister raises an objection and we meet it, he then finds another one. I have sent him an agreement to sign. I urge him to participate and to get on with the business of getting those child-care places up and running. The Commonwealth officers stand ready, with the sites, the places; they have just about everything ready to get those places built as soon as possible. Put aside your prejudices, Minister Nicholls, and get those child-care places up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that Senator Woodley refers to. In relation to your question about the health risks, I cannot say to you that I have been briefed about the health impacts of this reported concentration of radon gas, but I do think it would be unfortunate in this circumstance if unnecessary community alarm were generated over this particular matter. I might ask my own portfolio agencies or, if appropriate, some agencies in either Senator Collins's or Senator Cook's portfolio to perhaps provide more information on that at a later stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you say in your question, according to the report, land degradation is the suspected cause of the radon gas. I can say that the Commonwealth, as well as all state and territory governments, has agreed on the need for action to discourage land clearing and to promote vegetation establishment and retention. There is a strong recognition from governments that we will need to work closely together if we are to achieve this objective. As we know, the problem of land clearing does not respect state boundaries and solutions really have to be developed for this issue at a regional level. Although the Commonwealth has a leadership and a coordination role to play, the fact is that responsibility for land management lies with the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ought to say that I do believe that progress is being made. I particularly welcome announcements made by the New South Wales government, the Queensland government and the Western Australian government of measures to better regulate land clearing. There has also been positive action in most other states in relation to support for programs to assist protection of remnant vegetation, including covenanting programs. For example, New South Wales has recently decided to direct more resources, including additional staff, to voluntary nature conservation on private land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say the Commonwealth does not take its own responsibilities in this matter very seriously. We have a major and a continuing investment in dealing with the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin through the Murray-Darling Basin initiative.

It is a very enjoyable task to deal with an industry that has grown so rapidly in the last decade as a result of the very strong encouragement from the Australian government and the policies that we have helped them with. If you had said 15 years ago that the Australian shipbuilding industry would be an export oriented industry employing 6,000 people with nearly $2 billion worth of turnover&mdash;last year exports in fast ferries amounted to around $200 million; a third of the world's market for fast ferries comes from ferries produced in Australia&mdash;people would have suggested to you that that was an impossible achievement.</PARA></TALK.START>

We do not believe that we should accede to the agreement unless it is going to be one which all the major shipbuilding countries accede to and accept its rules.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role that has been played by the Prime Minister in settling this dispute is clear and unequivocal, and it is on the record. I spoke about it earlier this week. He made a number of phone calls, not only before he left the country but while he was away, and they were absolutely crucial in getting that initial agreement together and in getting the company together with the ACTU, which had not been the case before the Prime Minister's intervention and which was frankly acknowledged by the company spokesman, Mr Davis, and others as being a crucial element in the movement forward of the particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular agreement that was reached, and described by Mr Pallas as constituting a basis for the settlement, in the discussion between the two sides on the Wednesday night was absolutely crucial in laying out the basic foundations for what subsequently happened. Later on, that temporarily broke down on the basis of a further disagreement between the ACTU and the CRA, but the basic strategy of getting the matter before the commission to resolve the basic issue of equal pay for equal work was one that was very much the product of the initiative of the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all delighted&mdash;I know you are not delighted&mdash;that this matter has been resolved as expeditiously as it has, and in such a principled fashion as it has, and in such a way that reinforces the system as we know it, as it has. I know you are not thrilled with any of those things, but we are pleased with that because this goes to the heart and soul of what has kept this nation together for so long and what has created such a productive environment, particularly over this last 10 years of very sustained economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's role in all of this was wholly constructive, recognised as such by the CRA as extremely helpful in getting the parties together, getting the basic parameters of the dispute in shape and, in particular, marking out this strategy of getting the matter before the commission where it has been so successfully brought to a conclusion as a result of the decision of the commission and the ongoing negotiations that are flowing from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have no more of this churlishness and self-evident disappointment on your side that you did not find yourselves confronting a bigger blue than you did. The blue was a significant one because it involved basic issues of principle. It has been resolved in a way that reasserts and reaffirms those basic issues of principle and has left egg on the face of your side of politics for the approach that you adopted from the outset, which has been wholly discredited by the outcome from the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a reassertion of the principle of equal pay for equal work, which is something you are obviously deeply uncomfortable with and deeply hostile to. It reasserted the value and utility of compulsory arbitration which you are directly and unequivocally opposed to. It reasserted the notion of a proper role in the system for collective bargaining and the trade union movement, something you are also deeply unhappy with. So it has been an excellent week for the Prime Minister in all those respects.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central theme of my question is the division developing between certain members of the government and the unions. The Prime Minister returned to the country yesterday saying that the federal government was not anti-contract. There has been a number of statements on the matter from ministers in this place, including Senator Evans, and from Tim Pallas, the ACTU advocate. Also causing much heartburn to the Labor Party, we have seen the re-entry of Bob Hawke, former Prime Minister and former President of the ACTU, into the role of industrial advocate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a statement today from Tim Pallas, who said that the IRC had a role in protecting collective bargaining and unionism from attempts to undermine them. That is true. But he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Commission doesn't do it, what we have been able to demonstrate through this dispute is that the trade union movement is capable of doing it.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is saying that every time there is a dispute we can expect to see such action being taken. Jennie George describes it as `Mexican waves', there to overcome the 72-hour clause in the act. I suggest that we will see a continuation of that sort of activity with all its attendant costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as this dispute is concerned, the reaction of the government and the trade union leadership is, unfortunately, a return to the bad old days of the 1970s and 1980s and the way things were done at that time. I would have thought that the responsible thing for a Prime Minister or any other minister to have done in relation to this dispute would have been to quickly notify the commission and have it dealt with in the proper way without the unnecessary damage that was inflicted on industry, individuals and families. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator FORSHAW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crane, you know and I know that the system is a little more complex than that. What you have to remember is that this dispute started well over two years ago. It started when the company, CRA, set out on a deliberate course of discriminating against employees who wished to remain under the award system by coercing, enticing and bribing them to abandon the union and the award system for a considerable wage increase. That is when this dispute started. There has been a clear policy by CRA across its sites throughout the mining industry to drive the union off its sites using the ultimate power of if you offer enough money, you can eventually buy anyone out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What transpired after CRA had embarked upon that course&mdash;and in a speech last week to the Senate I gave an instance of that at another one of its mine sites, the Peak Hill goldmine&mdash;was a series of proceedings in the Industrial Relations Commission. On quite a number of occasions, the union and the ACTU were in the commission pursuing this issue, seeking to have the discriminatory tactics of CRA stopped and seeking to protect the position of people under the award. There were proceedings in respect of Bell Bay and in respect of Boyne Island smelter. They have been going on for quite some time, and this has been acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent in legal costs by the union movement in trying to have this issue dealt with. Even though they obtained some favourable decisions from the commission, CRA's basic approach was to thumb its nose at that and continue on its merry way, until it reached the point when the award employees at Weipa went on strike. When they went on strike, what was CRA's reaction? To endeavour to bring down the full force of tort law upon them by seeking to sue them for massive damages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CRA's approach was once again to seek to impose economic ruin upon a number of individual workers who were there simply seeking to protect their rights and to prevent being discriminated against. That is what led to the widening of this dispute. When all else had failed, because CRA refused to recognise its actions were contrary to the spirit and the intent of the industrial relations legislation, it then widened to a national dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we do regret that it had to come to that situation&mdash;no government likes to see that happen, and I can assure you, Senator Crane, that union officials do not welcome having to recommend that course of action&mdash;it reached that stage in order to bring this matter finally to a head. It has now been resolved within a week. Within a matter of a few days we have seen the greatest backdown by a company hell-bent on destroying unions in this country for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully, companies like CRA and others will now recognise that they can't discriminate against workers and that there is a system in place which not only recognises individual contracts and enterprise bargaining but also recognises the right of workers to have collective bargaining and not to be discriminated against. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>What a pathetic answer it was. Once again today we saw Senator Cook very long on rhetoric and very short on action. He has been talking about the innovation statement for the last 12 months. In that period he has made a lot of definitive statements about what he is going to say in his innovation statement. We now know that it is not going to be his innovation statement but that of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 May this year, in answer to Senator Chris Evans, Senator Cook said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone else is pulling their weight in terms of developing an innovation culture in Australia in the lead-up to the innovation statement . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In a supplementary answer, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has indicated it will bring down a formal statement on innovation in around August this year. As a consequence of setting ourselves that task, which is directed to making Australia the premier location for science, technology, engineering and innovation in the Asia-Pacific region, we have been in consultation with all of Australian industry on a sectoral basis. Each industry sector has been consulted. Over a thousand people have been spoken to directly. Our science community, many of our primary researchers, institutes and the CSIRO have been consulted.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I released a report which contains all of the recommendations the Australian community has made about inventing an innovation culture for Australia. This will be important feedstock for the innovation statement when we bring it down in August.</PARA>
<PARA>Then in June, Senator Cook again said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can say quite categorically to you, Senator&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in response to Senator Hill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that industry confidence in the innovation statement rides quite high.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 6 June, Senator Cook again said that in August and September this year, under the heading `Innovation Statement', they intended to make those announcements. He again talks about his thousand consultations with leading companies, organisations and individuals around Australia in all capital cities and major provincial centres. Again, on 8 June, he talks about interested individuals putting in submissions so that they can respond to his final report. In all of these instances, Senator Cook talks about the famous innovation statement which will be delivered in August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, today Senator Hill, after asking Senator Cook about the innovation statement we are still waiting for, also asked about some syndicated research and development. Senator Cook, in response to that question on syndicated research and development, claimed that consultations had taken place within the industry&mdash;and I ask you to remember all that he said in last May and June about the thousand people he had seen and all of the consultations which had taken place all around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say: this process has been a complete farce. On October 25, which is some four or five months after Senator Cook spoke earlier in the year, letters were sent by Ausindustry to the Macquarie Bank and other syndicate providers. An advertisement appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of October 26 announcing a series of consultative meetings&mdash;this is in October&mdash;the first of which was held on October 30 at the Sheraton Hotel in Mascot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deadline for receipt of submissions was November 15. The IR&amp;D board meets to rubberstamp the changes to the finance scheme guideline today. The consultative process described by Senator Cook gave the industry little more than three weeks to respond. Indeed, if a submission did not arrive until the deadline, Ausindustry would have had only seven days to consider it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much for all of Senator Cook's previous statements regarding his innovation statement being put down in August.

It is now 22 November 1995 and the government still has not responded to that Senate report on CSIRO. If anything is indicative of the minister's irresponsibility and his inability to handle his portfolio, it is the fact that, even after 11 months, his department and he, on behalf of the government, cannot respond to a Senate inquiry which was held over 12 months ago and whose conclusions were brought down 11 months ago.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Ms Holten</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your facsimiles of 25 October 1995 to myself and a number of other Members of Parliament and Senators concerning the possible impact of the restructured Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program (AESIP). I am replying as Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, including responsibility for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You raised a number of issues about the possible effects of AESIP funds being allocated through per capita arrangements from 1997. The restructure of AESIP into two elements&mdash;Supplementary Assistance to be paid on a per capita basis and Strategic Results Projects for time-limited strategic projects to accelerate progress to achieving `National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy' (AEP) goals&mdash;has been put in place as part of the Commonwealth Government's response to the `National Review of Education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples'. The Review identified that some 80 per cent of funding under AESIP is for recurrent purposes, rather than strategic initiatives. It also identified that, as a submission based program, AESIP has not resulted in those States and Territories with the highest numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students necessarily receiving the highest levels of AESIP funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to Recommendation 37 of the Review, the per capita element of AESIP will be introduced from I January 1997. By replacing annual applications for funding with demand-driven per capita funding, education providers will be able to plan their educational services in the same way as they do with mainstream funding, that is, the number of students enrolled will determine the level of services required. Apart from a small number of exceptions, this restructuring of AESIP has been welcomed as a more transparent and more equitable way of allocating supplementary funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to per capita arrangements, State and Territory Governments which increase their commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education will be able to bid for additional Commonwealth funding under the Strategic Results Projects element of AESIP. This means that the level of AESIP funding provided by the Commonwealth in 1997 in those States and Territories may total more than 100 per cent of 1995 AESIP funding levels. I ask you to note that the Australian Capital Territory Department of Education and Training, and Canberra Institute of Technology are currently generously funded under AESIP in comparison with many other States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will not be known exactly what level of funding education providers in the Australian Capital Territory will be entitled to under AESIP per capita until the 1996 enrolment data can be used to determine the allocation in the first instance. 1997 enrolment data will determine the level to which, if at all, each education provider's allocation will need to be adjusted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As States and Territories have the constitutional responsibility for the education of all students, including Indigenous students, the vast bulk of funding for preschool, school and vocational education and training comes from the State and Territory Governments, not the Commonwealth. AESIP, as the Commonwealth's principal supplementary funding source, provides additional educational services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students to accelerate the goals of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy (AEP); basic education services for Indigenous students have been, and remain, the domain of mainstream funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You were concerned about the capacity of the Australian Capital Territory's Department of Education and Training to respond to the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA) Taskforce's National Strategy for Education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders unless they had access to additional Commonwealth funding under AESIP. Primarily the National Review's recommendations that were directed to MCEETYA are those recommendations which require State and Territory government, not Commonwealth, action for their implementation. However, the Commonwealth has provided additional AESIP funds as a major contribution to sharing the responsibility and the commitment with State and Territory Governments for implementing some of the areas of need identified in the National Review through the Strategic Results Projects element of AESIP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You were also concerned that the introduction of per capita AESIP would provide some incentive for systems and sectors to compete for enrolments. Mainstream funding is also enrolment driven so if student numbers increase so do resource allocations. Conversely, if student numbers decrease so do resource allocations. Additional enrolments, however, require additional services to be provided which is why per capita funding is the only sure way to achieve equity between education providers. I recognise that education providers both within and between systems and sectors do compete for students and will continue to do so. The Commonwealth would not wish, however, to deny the right of Indigenous or any other students (or their parents) to make choices about which system or which sector would be the most appropriate for their education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please contact and arrange a meeting with Mr Peter Buckskin, Assistant Secretary, Aboriginal Education Branch of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Mr Buckskin's telephone number is (06) 240 7722. Not only is Mr Buckskin the head of the Branch which administers AESIP, he is also one of the senior Departmental officials who will continue to be involved in bilateral negotiations.</PARA>

<PARA>The committee's 25th report for 1995 relates to the proposed construction of a purpose-built Commonwealth law courts facility in Melbourne. The building will provide accommodation for the High Court, the Federal Court, the Industrial Relations Court and the Family Court. The site for the proposed development is located on the corner of William and Latrobe Streets, Melbourne, directly opposite Flagstaff Gardens. The estimated total cost of the building, including fit-out costs and rise and fall, has been agreed at $108.4 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 the government decided to provide clearly identifiable and purpose-designed Commonwealth law courts buildings in each capital city to accommodate the courts and associated staff and facilities. The Attorney-General's Department aims to provide the judiciary, legal practitioners, court staff and the public with court facilities which meet the requirements of security and access and have a positive impact on the social and physical environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The four jurisdictions currently occupy space in Melbourne at four separate city locations. At all locations the accommodation does not provide adequately for the operational and growth requirements of the courts. In addition, the level of security achievable in these buildings does not provide acceptable protection for judges, staff and the public. That was very evident when we visited the buildings before we had our public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the development of this proposal the Attorney-General's Department advised that several options were investigated. These included: refurbishment of the existing accommodation, fit out of leased premises, acquisition of an existing building and converting it to a courts building and building a purpose designed facility. The comparison of the options provided to the committee indicates clearly that the construction of a new court complex on the Flagstaff site represents the best value for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In agreeing to the project proceeding, the committee has recommended that the Attorney-General's Department consult with the Victorian government regarding a number of issues, including the possible sharing of library and child-care facilities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to the amendment moved by Senator Margetts on behalf of the Greens, the government opposes the amendment. This government introduced HECS in 1989 to ensure that those who gain a higher education make a contribution to that education. On average, the contribution is only about one-fifth of the cost of the study.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But HECS is more than that. Repayment of the contribution is income contingent, and students do not have to pay any contribution up front. They only have to make repayments when they can afford to do so. Also, contributions from HECS are forwarded directly to universities when paid up front or to the HECS trust fund, which in turn is spent on higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package of initiatives the government is seeking does not breach these principles. The savings gained are spent on higher education. The measure only impacts on those who can afford to repay their debt. The savings are achieved without an increase in the HECS debt of any Australian student. Without the savings, expenditure on new places and research cannot go ahead. Australia will be worse off for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This comprehensive budget-neutral package has the support of the AVCC. Yesterday in a press release, Frank Hambly, the Executive Director of the AVCC, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the bill is rejected there will be reduced opportunities and access for new students, and reduced funding for research infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA>The impact of the budget initiatives for additional places in Queensland is dramatic. With the additional places provided in the budget, the participation rate in Queensland will reach the national average over the next four years. Without the additional places, Queensland will remain a full percentage point behind the average for the 17- to 34-year-old population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to comment on proposed amendment No. 2 from Senator Margetts. It deals with the question of proof of citizenship. I just want to make the following comment. An Australian birth certificate will be accepted as proof of citizenship. Universities will not be required to check documentation for all students. Students will be required to declare their citizenship status on enrolment. Over their course of study, the declaration will be verified on a sample basis. The AVCC has endorsed this approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a comment to make about Senator Bell's amendment; a question on the savings from the citizenship measure. Savings from the government's proposed changes to HECS for non-citizens are only one component of the total savings in the government's higher education package. The estimate of savings is based in part on survey research by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on migrants' intention to take out citizenship. The government has taken into account, in estimating savings, the likely behaviour of permanent residents in response to the amendments to the act. That concludes the government's response at the second reading stage, and we commend the bill to the parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond briefly to Senator Margetts's amendment, which is really slapping this government with a feather. In effect, she is saying that because this government has misled so many students on so many previous occasions in relation to HECS thresholds and rates of repayment, she now wants an undertaking from the government that they will not again mislead them. That is a very generous approach. But the real question is: what faith can students now have in this government in circumstances in which they have been misled so often? This government will, no doubt, give the undertaking, premised on them being successful in the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be interesting to hear Senator Schacht's response. The government has not hesitated to promise the world in the past, so I presume that it will do it again. It will promise Australian students that it will not decrease the threshold and it will not increase the repayments over the next three years. Come an election victory, it will take no notice of that promise. This is the government that has promised the students before that there would be no up-front fees, there would be no increases in HECS and the thresholds would not be reduced. That is against a background of so many other broken promises in so many other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the government of the l-a-w tax promises; it is not a promise, it is law. The tax cuts will be implemented by a new government, Mr Keating said before the next election. Come the election victory, the promise was forgotten. This is the government that promised that there would be no new taxes or increased taxes. I do not have to remind people of the wine tax attempt and the building taxes and the increases in other sales taxes. This government takes no notice of its promises at all. It promised pensioners that all pensioners would be taken out of the tax system. It was inconvenient after the election, so it was abandoned. One can go on. There are so many instances of promises made and promises forgotten as soon as an election victory has been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the point of asking this government to promise again? They had their opportunity and they failed. They have been put to the test and they have lost. I would be much more comforted if I knew that an undertaking given by the minister now to students would be meaningful, but I have no basis at all on which to believe that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I guess it is rather hard to vote against Senator Margetts's amendment because at least it does put on paper the fact that the government has previously misled students and that HECS thresholds and repayment levels have been changed&mdash;that is, the threshold reduced and the repayment level increased&mdash;on three different occasions since the inception of HECS under this government. As I said in the second reading stage, it is so unfair on students who have in effect entered into a compact with this government in relation to the cost of provision of their education that the government would pay so much and they would pay a share to be repaid on a certain basis. But unilaterally time and again the government changes the rules on Australian students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not oppose Senator Margetts's amendment, but I certainly do not have the confidence that she apparently has and I do not think there is any reason at all why a student should believe a word that this government says in relation to HECS. I have no doubt at all that if they are successful they will do what they have done in the past and HECS will increase, repayments will be accelerated, as they are trying to accelerate them here today, and the threshold will again be reduced. Australian students would be much smarter to learn from having been misled before and not allow this government the opportunity to do it again. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Be that as it may, I think what we are facing here is the old salami tactic. What concerns me about the proposals concerning payment of up-front HECS is that people who are resident non-citizens will be treated in a different manner from those who are entitled to HECS. They will be treated in a different manner so far as that is concerned, but obviously they are not going to be treated in a different manner in the area of taxation&mdash;and nor will their parents. I know of resident non-citizens whose families have been paying tax for years. That tax would have gone into the pool of government receipts for expenditure in areas such as health, education and the like. The government appears to have a different and unequal attitude now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said by other speakers, it is ironic that we are now being asked by the government to accept a principle which is inherently contradictory. You can deal with some students in a discriminatory fashion when it comes to HECS, but you make them tow the line when it comes to taxation. I know taxation is not the responsibility of DEET. DEET, and the minister particularly, should have an overall picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people I am referring to are very, very unhappy because of the fact that the income earners in those families have been paying tax for many years&mdash;in a particular case, for 18 years&mdash;at the same rate as resident citizens. Now you will make the students in that family pay up-front HECS but you will not lessen the taxation burden on their parents. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it seems to me that the flaw in Senator Margetts's amendment is in fact that the student who makes the decision to make early voluntary repayment on the basis of the lower threshold does get a substantial advantage for having done so. Therefore, to have the right to sort of opt in and opt out after taking that advantage would seem to be unfair to the community as a whole. The community as a whole is basically funding higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the only way to draft it fairly would be if you had a formula that somehow allowed for recovery of a proportion of the 10 per cent discount if the student opted out of the arrangement that they had entered into. That would obviously be extremely complicated. I do not know at what rate you would set it out and what repayment mechanisms you would include in legislation. I certainly do not think it is the type of amendment that it would be possible to draft on the run&mdash;not to draft effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would also be a quite difficult debate on principle&mdash;what would be the appropriate level of repayment? In other words, if students had taken the 10 per cent benefit and had been making repayments for 12 months, will there be a formula that takes into account the length of repayment under the voluntary system? It strikes me as a complex and difficult issue and not one that would be benefited by delaying this amendment for a few minutes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we consign this particular proposition to history, which seems to be the way Senator Hill is suggesting we should go, we really ought to look carefully at what is suggested here. The opportunity to begin voluntary repayments is an opportunity which should not be denied anybody. It is an opportunity that the government is offering but, as is usual in the history of the HECS saga, it is not a simple offer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are strings attached, it seems, once you have entered the arrangement. Unlike the situation with HECS overall, where the government can unilaterally change things at a whim to suit itself, students entering this voluntary repayment system are locked in. That is the way the deal has been done so many times before: students are expected to consistently obey while the government has the opportunity to change the rules. I wonder why that is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HECS debt is not like other debts. It does not come into operation, as far as repayments go, until a certain threshold of income is reached. The government is also introducing a discount for this voluntary repayment opportunity. The government invented this mess. The government has changed it on the run&mdash;unilaterally&mdash;several times already and the changes have all been the government's way. Yet the minister representing the government in the chamber today, Senator Schacht, tells us that further changes, equitable though they may be, should not be made on the basis that changes should not be made on the run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister, this whole thing has been changed on the run. Year after year we come here and see further changes proposed by the government. This time we are told, `No, we cannot look at these matters because it is all a bit hard.' I want to know why, in designing a voluntary repayment opportunity, you designed something which locks people in and does not recognise what life is all about&mdash;that situations and circumstances change for people as well as for governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One-off repayments should be possible. That is the way the rest of the world works with debts incurred in other situations. Why has the government designed something which is so complicated, which is capable of being changed to benefit the government but not the students? It is not a truly voluntary repayment system because, once a person enters into it, it seems to become a different version of a compulsory system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts's amendment should be accommodated in some way by the government. With the entire resources of the government at the disposal of the minister, I cannot understand why it is all a bit too hard to consider and accept. I accept the minister's invention that $50 million could be lost to the government overnight if all these students repaid $1 and got out of it that way. It was an evil mind that recognised that possibility so quickly. It was certainly beyond me; I did not predict it. But if that problem has been identified, surely something could be done reasonably equitably if this amendment were delayed sufficiently long to find the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it took the minister 30 seconds to think of a way to knock off $50 million, surely he could think of a way to stop it equally as quickly. I know it is a bit of a challenge, but if the purpose of this amendment is to bring about a voluntary repayment system which does not penalise the volunteer, surely the minister could direct some of his imagination to that problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the most amazing things that has occurred as a result of this Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) being considered and prior to this bill being considered is some of the phone calls we were receiving. The amazing thing is&mdash;and we have heard already from the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee and also from some other groups&mdash;that they have been asked by the government to deliver the minor parties on these issues on the basis that `it will be their responsibility if they don't deliver us and oppose the government's money-raising schemes via the students' disadvantages, because they then will be responsible for other cuts in education'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this approach is atrocious, and it is absolutely indicative of the lack of commitment to higher education, self-funding, user-pays, industry rules and so on that we have heard about. It should be made totally clear that the government is using the representatives of some bodies&mdash;representatives who are supposedly representing the interests of their groups&mdash;to try to push its line. It is divide and rule, which I think is disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put on the record the fact that some senators in this chamber will go down kicking and screaming if the government tries to use this as a slimy excuse to pull funding out of other areas of tertiary education. It is not good enough that the government would try to raise money from students and ex-students who are suffering hardship and then say that that is what is needed to fund proper higher education. It is not good enough, and we will support the Democrats' amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the government did promise to fund some further places&mdash;I think it was about 2,000 places Australia-wide&mdash;in areas where there was population growth and greater demand, particularly in Queensland, with some in Western Australia and a few in Tasmania. In some of those areas, students traditionally have not been well served and have not had the opportunities students elsewhere in Australia have had. We have actually been calling for those additional places for some time. When the government made an announcement that finally it would meet that public obligation, we recognised that and commended the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is also true that the government subsequently sought to link the provision of those places with the passage of these new provisions in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2). It has not sought to extract funding for its public commitments from any other sector in the community. Instead, it has sought to take advantage of students, presumably believing that they do not have the political clout people in other sectors of the community have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has disgracefully gone on to campuses&mdash;particularly in Queensland&mdash;and told students that, unless they roll over and accept this plan of an accelerated repayment of HECS, they will be depriving other students of the opportunity for higher education. That is appalling. I said that as I was looking at you, Temporary Chairman Reynolds, and you are a Queenslander. I think that level of political blackmail against the interests of Australian students is disgraceful and demonstrates how a government can lose its public standing as a result of staying in office for too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It goes beyond what Senator Margetts has said&mdash;that this is an attempt to apply pressure to minor parties or even to us by telling us that we will have to suffer the burden of the missed opportunities of Australian students. It goes beyond us politicians who participate in the political arena: it goes to the students themselves, the people to whom the government has made this threat. As I said, I think this is one of the worst exercises of political blackmail that I have seen for a long time. The issues are unrelated, and the government should recognise that and cease this campaign of threatening students in order to fund a commitment that it should have funded in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, there is the issue of merit in relation to this particular provision. The government has not made out any case for accelerated repayment. It must accept that, in practice, it entered into what I refer to as a compact and what I think Senator Bell referred to as an agreement with students; that is, students would accept an obligation to pay for part of their higher education costs and would make that payment on certain terms and conditions. Then, unilaterally, without any reference to students, the government has sought to change the rules. We say that is a breach of faith to students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of HECS repayment, we believe there are two issues involved. The first issue is what is an appropriate HECS repayment for future students. We think that is a separate debate from unilaterally changing the rules on existing or past students. We are prepared to have that debate for the future, but that is not what has been attempted here. What has been attempted has been to impose this new obligation on past students as well as future students. On that basis we have a compromise, and that is to exclude existing or past students from this obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That said, it logically follows that we will oppose the Democrats' amendment. We will then put our amendment, which will exclude current students and past students. The government will then not be permitted by this legislation to impose upon them new obligations contrary to the undertakings given to them at the time they undertook their higher education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to place on the record the government's response to the Democrat amendments. In terms of amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5, the government's higher education package announced in the budget was deliberately made cost neutral: that is, the savings made in the higher education system are being spent on new higher education initiatives. In this way, the government has demonstrated its commitment to address priorities in higher education in a fiscally responsible way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits to flow from the initiatives are an additional 11,000 undergraduate places and increased expenditure on research. The Democrat amendments, in effect, seek to protect those on incomes above average weekly earnings at the expense of new places and newcomers to higher education. I think that is the nub. We want more people in higher education, whereas some of these amendments seem to be more about preserving the existing number. We want to increase the number. Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 would cost $85 million over four years&mdash;funding that would be sufficient to create about 8,500 new student places in higher education; a good sized university anywhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding Democrat amendments Nos 6, 7, 8 and 9, under HECS students who pay the contribution up-front at enrolment receive a discount of 25 per cent on their payment. This discount is an incentive to increase the number of students who pay up-front. As this bill inserts the provision that non-citizens and New Zealanders are required to pay up-front, it is not appropriate for those students to receive the discount. In total, the Democrat amendments would cost $95 million over four years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also was rising to speak, as Senator Hill rose just then. I had worked out the same thing: accelerated repayment does not affect the overall revenue; it just affects the time at which that revenue is gained. `In the future revenue neutral' means for this budget. But what you will miss out on is the income that would come from the normal rate of payment in the future budgets. Then who will you blame it on? This seems to be the Laurie Potter version of balancing budgets: pretend that you are richer by getting payments up-front; get them earlier rather than later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that sense, you may well be inadvertently, or advertently, not giving accurate information to the Senate. In relation to the outcome of this measure, it will not cost $85 million. It simply will rearrange the schedule of payments so that that possible maximum $85 million will come in at a time when, if we continue to go the way we are going, we will need it&mdash;and that is, later on, when there will continue to be payments made by students. Of course, with the discounts being offered to those students who are able to pay back earlier, you may get more revenue by allowing them to pay back at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is really necessary that we make this point: it is funding by rearrangement of payments. You are fiddling the books to make it look as though you have raised the payments. But, in fact, all you are doing is making sure that that payment is not coming in later in future years rather than the current year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank both Senator Hill and Senator Margetts for pursuing this argument so strongly. I think students of Australia will appreciate the efforts of those two senators also. This proposition, which has been put forward by the government, in opposition to it, deserves to be pursued strongly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us recognise what the government is proposing. It is proposing to link in this area, and this area only, a repayment&mdash;which now effectively is a tax, an obligation which is exercised through the Australian Taxation Office on people who have been students and who have incurred a HECS debt&mdash;to provision of extra tertiary and university education places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I presume that the government did not do what the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) has been doing a little here, this afternoon&mdash;and that is, plucking figures from the air. I presume that there is a basis for the need that those extra places be provided. If there is a need for those extra places to be provided, surely the government is not proposing that they will not be provided if the HECS repayments are insufficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, and I remind the government again: the deal, the compact which was entered into with the student was that those repayments would be made when the student's income, subsequent to graduation, or whenever, reached a certain level. The fact that the income has not yet reached that certain level is not the student's fault in particular. It is, as Andrew Denton says, society who is to blame. It is how society is at the moment. With the level of unemployment that we have, more students than were predicted are unable to commence repayment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government wants to introduce a bit of hurry-up into this, that is one thing. But to link it to the provision of other places is an entirely different matter. This is the difficulty that we have. As I mentioned before, we have a Queensland minister here who is terribly excited about successful negotiations which took place earlier this year between the Goss and Keating governments. I think that minister must have entered into those negotiations very blindly indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It seems to me that the negotiating team would have realised, if its members had asked the questions that I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate, how frail the basis was upon which the promises had been made by the federal government. If those negotiators from the Queensland government realised that those extra places were based upon the idea that certain people would repay their HECS debts faster, I hope they were intelligent enough to laugh at such a proposition. It seems as though at least 1,750 students and their state government have been sold a beauty by this government in that they have been told that there will be that number of additional places&mdash;`It's alright; we'll meet this obligation; we recognise the obligation and will meet it.' But the federal government has not informed those people of how shaky the funding for that would be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am extremely pleased that this has been highlighted here this afternoon. It really does need to be highlighted. It is a matter which not only is of great concern now but also will be in the future when the money which the government proposes to rake in now, of course, will not be available for whatever future purposes it has in mind. Perhaps the government just wants it all in the bag while it can control it&mdash;and the future be damned!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really seems to me to be a very strange way to base these promises, especially to Queensland, but also to Tasmania and, I understand, Western Australia. It is a very poor way that the government has chosen to meet an obligation which it has recognised. I think it may well have to reap the disadvantages that accrue from starting off on such a very shaky proposition. </PARA>

Obviously, both the Greens and the Democrats would have preferred a stronger line in relation to the creeping extra commitments which students are being asked to make. I recall being in the United Kingdom and trying to pay my way through university. Halfway through the fees were changed radically to full economic cost, which was amazing because when I arrived in Britain it was not the case. I was absolutely panic stricken.

If this amendment is carried, 5,000 of those places go out the window and 5,000 fewer young people in particular will have an opportunity to be at university.

Until today the figure mentioned was 2,000 places, but the government announced it would provide additional places, as I indicated earlier in the debate. They committed themselves to providing those places, sought the public benefit from committing themselves to those places, and now they are clearly setting themselves up to break that promise to Australian students and Australian families. Of course, they want to blame someone else for it.

We will not provide additional places in Queensland, up the Queensland coast, in Central Queensland, although we have promised otherwise.

This government wants to break the rule by, in effect, charging existing and past students for the provision of those extra places. So they should stand doubly condemned, firstly, for seeking to charge existing and past students for a burden that should be shared by the community as a whole and, secondly, for what is apparently going to be the breaking of yet another promise&mdash;in this instance, a promise to the young people of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising because they have turned breaking promises into an art form. So it is not surprising that they are going to let down Australian students yet again. The minister will acknowledge, if he was prepared to approach this honestly, that they have broken their promise to students in relation to HECS. They have reduced the threshold. They have lifted the repayments. On three separate occasions they have broken their promises in relation to HECS. They are seeking to do it again today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is on the record as breaking promises to students, yet they will do it again today not only in relation to this bill, in the terms of the bill, but in the terms that they say that the consequences of a failure of this bill legitimises them in breaking the promise to provide the extra places. It is as simple as that. If they want to say, `We will not provide those places, we will break our promise,' let them do it and let them suffer the political costs of doing so. There is an alternative and the alternative is that we will meet that wider public responsibility. We will fund the places in the same way as this country funds every other undergraduate place. So the choice will be clear&mdash;a government of broken promises continuing to abuse students for their own political benefit or an alternative that will give greater credit to students than they are given at the moment. </PARA>

What the government did was keep the numbers in South Australia and provide extra funds with these changes to ensure that Queensland could match the demand that has resulted from its population growth. That is what this government is about and that is what this bill is about. It is not a matter of blackmail.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like now to say that the Greens will be opposing the schedule, part 9, pages 18 to 20, items 32 to 37 inclusive. The purpose of this action is to delete all references to certain persons not entitled to deferred contributions.

It certainly is something that we would oppose as strongly as possible. We feel it is a cynical exercise in terms of trying to raise revenue on the basis of some unproven statement of commitment to Australia. There is no indication at all that this can be or is proven and, even if it were, it would probably still not be valid in terms of the discrimination that it implies. Therefore, I urge that the chamber support our move to oppose these items of the schedule. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Bell just indicated, there are a number of varied responses to the government's provision before the committee at the moment. The response that we are debating first is that of the Greens, which in this instance could be said to be the pure response&mdash;that is, to wipe the provision out altogether. Senator Bell has circulated the amendments of the Australian Democrats, which look to address specific instances of hardship and to protect people from those instances. Our amendment is drafted rather to protect those who have entered Australia on the basis of what they understand are the rules in relation to obtaining the benefits of a HECS education and who find that they lose the benefits again as a result of unilateral action of this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, I have to concede that I am not totally comfortable with what the government is doing here because we have not really heard any argument for changing the test from permanent residency to citizenship other than the revenue raising argument. We have not heard the government seriously address the social and multicultural consequences that might flow from it. But we are always conscious of the need to protect the revenue. That is why our proposal is something of a compromise and is drafted in terms of protecting those who have understood the rules and entered this country upon the existing set of rules. Therefore, our position is not to go as far as that of the amendment put by the Greens, which the Democrats have said they would support. Thus, we will vote against the amendment of Senator Margetts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes this amendment. The government is introducing additional flexibility for HECS debtors by offering them the option to begin making repayments against their debt before they were required to do so. In return, debtors who take up this option will receive a 10 per cent reduction in the level of the HECS debt. I have just realised that this is already on the record, but I will put it forward again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment proposed by the Greens will enable HECS debtors to make only one repayment instead of ongoing repayments in exchange for a 10 per cent debt reduction, effectively devaluing the government HECS asset. The cost of this proposed amendment would be up to $50 million over four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of citizenship and this amendment that Senator Margetts has moved, the government believes that, if the Greens' proposals were accepted to completely remove the government's changes to HECS for non-citizens, savings to the budget would be forgone, amounting to some $17 million over the period 1996-99. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change here is quite reasonable in that at the moment a person who comes into Australia and gets residency status immediately has access to our higher education system. We are saying that, if you are going to be a resident, after three years you have the opportunity to become a citizen and apply for citizenship. That means that you are committed to being active in the Australian community and contributing to the Australian community. That is fair enough and, therefore, you are eligible for the HECS arrangements. We believe that is a reasonable proposition to put to people&mdash;that after three years they make their minds up as to whether they are going to become an Australian citizen and participate in a full way in our Australian community. We do not think that is an unreasonable measure to put on people, particularly as we will raise revenue from those who do not and that revenue will be used to create more places. </PARA>

I do not think people will forgive the government for that kind of logic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of what Senator Margetts has just said, I would like to make a couple more comments. On the issue of non-citizens, no other country is as generous as Australia. We are certainly miles in front of what they offer. No Australian citizen could go to any other country in the world and enter university under the conditions that we have in Australia. British, US and New Zealand citizens cannot even get back into their own country's universities under the same conditions. It is nonsense to imply that this measure is the beginning of up-front fees for Australian higher education, which apparently some people have suggested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our proposal does not require non-citizens to pay full fees for their university education. They will pay only up-front HECS, equivalent to one-fifth of the average course cost. The Australian taxpayer is paying the other four-fifths through HECS funds or it is returned to the higher education system for the provision of additional places for Australian students. Why shouldn't we make sure non-citizens do the same? Clearly, they could avoid any payment if they leave before earning sufficiently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to pick up the minister on one point. The minister separates taxpayers out as if they may not be one and the same people, as either students or the families of students. That is a very important point. You are forgetting about the contribution that these students or the families of these students may have been making for years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister again exposed the real purpose of the government in bringing about this proposition and emphasised the reason for its opposition. If the government was truly honest about its intention to increase revenue or to defray the costs which may be associated with paying for foreigners who are not citizens, the government may have been wiser to explore the options of reciprocal arrangements, which it does so successfully with other payments such as social security payments, pensions, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Doing it this way reveals the holes in the government's arguments. I accept and I agree it is quite demonstrable. It is a fact that other countries are not nearly so generous in their provision of education and other advantages for non-citizens. The way to resolve that surely is not to penalise those who have been, as Senator Margetts points out, paying tax and contributing in other ways to the Australian community. To suggest that those students who take up places at our universities are supported by taxpayers and then divorce the taxpayers from the students when in fact they are one and the same person and belong to families who have been paying tax and may themselves have been doing so for an incalculable amount of time&mdash;</PARA>

In relation to paragraph (a), people who are under 18 years of age will not be penalised for not following through and becoming Australian citizens. Paragraph (b) will allow those citizens of a country which does not permit its citizens to hold dual citizenship to be excused.

We have taken advice from a higher authority which suggests that a more appropriate way of dealing with the matter would be for me to move an amendment to remove from Senator Bell's amendments paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of amendment No. 2, which presumably would be opposed by the Democrats, Senator Harradine and the Greens, on the basis of what has been heard, but supported by the government because it would be cutting back this provision somewhat.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to indicate that the procedure outlined by Senator Hill seems to resolve the problem and I do not object to the procedure; but, of course, I will be opposing the proposition that (a), (b) and (c) be removed. I think No. 1 must be included in whatever process. I have been led to believe that No. 1 is necessary to facilitate No. 2. Perhaps the clerks could advise us if that is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address briefly the response by the minister so that it can be clear as to what I understand the reason is for my moving this. I think the minister has missed the point. Telling us that parents can make decisions on behalf of their children and that wards of the state can make decisions in their own right misses the point that we were trying, in paragraph (a) of No. 2, to address&mdash;that is, the situation where a young person wishes to make a move which is not necessarily supported by the parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a young person is eligible for and has been accepted into university on an academic basis and is told that the HECS arrangements will be different, depending on whether or not you are a citizen of Australia, then the young person whose aspirations are subjected to parental consent does not have the same options as the person who is not in that situation. I am not going to stand here and describe the situations where that might arise, but I can imagine many of them. Lest I be accused of making assumptions about certain cultures, I will not give those examples, but I ask the government to understand that there will be many situations where it would be much more appropriate not to introduce conflict into the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I declare an interest in this in a way, having a daughter who is 18. She is old enough to make her own decisions. As a matter of fact, I think she has been making up her own mind since she was about two. Far be it for me to oppose the direction of her decisions. Luckily I am in a situation where there are no cultural pressures to be brought upon our view of the world. We are much in accord, Sally and me, on most matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we know there are families in which the parents are following the cultural beliefs that are well entrenched and well respected and in which the younger generation wants to participate in the Australian culture in a different way. By doing what the government is proposing, we are emphasising those potential cultural differences. We are also requiring young people to make decisions and to change their decisions. There is a potential for young people to be put in conflict with their parents over their need&mdash;a need which has been emphasised by the government&mdash;to become citizens. I think that is a very dangerous thing for the government to be doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's explanation does not address that at all. It does not recognise as a problem the situation where young people are put in conflict with their parents by what the government requires to be done in order to begin tertiary studies. I am sorry the minister missed that point, because it seems to me to be the fundamental point about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope, if (a), (b) and (c) are not successful, that paragraph (d) may be able to resolve that situation. It seems to me to be a little difficult to get through to the government that that is going to be a problem. Perhaps it may be a problem in only a handful of cases, but to me, when it is a problem, we are emphasising and enforcing that problem within a family. These are the sorts of things that I do not think governments should be meddling in at all. I think the government should be facilitating a resolution of them rather than causing them to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I think it would be most unwise of me to construct an example. I hope I have indicated sufficiently that cultural differences could lead to it; but there are other differences. There are other generational differences, religious differences and perhaps circumstantial situations which could arise where a person under 18 years of age seeks to become a citizen, is unable to without parental consent and is then in a situation of conflict. That conflict is caused by what the government is proposing to do. That is why we moved that. I hope that (d) might be able to address it, if the government recognises that it could occur and if (d) is successful. </PARA>

But, put quite simply, we would seek to oppose part 8 of the schedule, which is on page 17. The purpose of part 8 is not to exempt certain holders of scholarships. The main effect of this, as I indicated in my speech in the second reading debate, is to deny schoolteachers in particular the opportunity to be exempt from HECS payments for staff development purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I dealt with disagreements within the union movement whereby various factions within one of the major unions&mdash;the AWU-FIME&mdash;were busy accusing each other of not being concerned about the rank and file and of basically being concerned about self-interest rather than looking after the workers in the AWU-FIME.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised this issue because the massive reduction in the number of union members bears some relation to the feeling that so many Australian workers now have&mdash;the feeling that these mega-unions act in a way which is irrelevant to their interests. That explains why so many workers are now keen to enter into negotiated arrangements with their employers without the `benefit' of union intervention. It also explains why the deals the employers arrange are clearly better than the deals the unions have been able to arrange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for that of course is that the employer arranged deals are linked to productivity&mdash;a concept which appeals to so many Australian workers because they rightly feel that, the harder they work, the better their reward should be. That is the essence of this matter, a matter which has threatened to disrupt so much of Australia over the question of CRA and other elements of the union movement. What I was saying yesterday&mdash;and there was an interjection along these lines by Senator Schacht&mdash;was that I understood that union elections were lively and active events. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the N.S.W. AWU-FIME Federal Branch Executive Meeting held on Monday, 7th. August, 1995, Joint Secretary Russ Collinson, when flagging that he was ratting on another deal, cited as justification for doing so that the Mike O'Shea team (AWU) had breached an agreement that involved supporting a slate of candidates (see attached "How to Vote"). In support of his claim he cited the fact that I had nominated against the "team" to which O'Shea and he had given their imprimatur. I indicated that I had not breached any deal with Collinson, and that since I have known him he has had a poor record himself in that regard. There is no way that I would do a deal with Collinson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was prepared, like my fellow N.S.W. Branch Executive Members, to be blackmailed out of standing for office in the Union that I had served for over forty years to keep some semblance of AWU identity in the amalgamated N.S.W Federal Branch. This, despite the fact that it would mean that among those who would survive were AWU people who through incompetence and treachery had delivered the N.S.W AWU Federal Branch into the control of the debt-ridden, no-principled FIME.</PARA>
<PARA>They are good mates, obviously! It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tried not to think of my Fellow Branch Executive Members who had earned their positions as Executive Members through their efforts on the Union's behalf and by the votes of the rank and file members, but who would now be replaced by opportunists who had obtained their tickets in contradiction of the Rules of the Union. However, I was not prepared to support the O'Shea-Collinson "How to Vote" that would have allowed two non-eligible people, Innes and Farley, to be voted into a position that is meant to be filled by genuine members of AWU or FIME who no doubt would consider it a privilege to be elected by the rank and file members. Innes and Farley were not valid members of the AWU and neither were they valid members of the amalgamated Union. Proof of this was that the Electoral Officer rejected their nominations which relied on AWU tickets, and they were only restored to the Ballot on the supportive evidence from either of the Joint Secretaries, or both. Innes's fall-back was that she held a 1992 T.A.P. ticket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt you people as Branch Executive Committee Members of FIME were consulted and agreed to support the Collinson and O'Shea "How to Vote" ticket, and I can only wonder how this proposition could have received your support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ernie Ecob's legal challenge to Innes and Farley resulted in their withdrawal from the Ballot . . . I did not have the financial resources to take legal action, and it was therefore fortunate that Ernie Ecob did so successfully, thereby upholding the Union's Rules.

<PARA>As I have said, this is all relevant because of what is clearly turning out to be a struggle with the principle of whether workers should have the right to enter into agreements they regard as being in their best interests or be obliged to be, if you like, coerced into membership of a union. Quite frankly, with this union, I was intrigued to see that in a recent court action the chief judge of the New South Wales Registry of Industrial Relations Court of Australia accepted the fact that one particular worker `got inadequate advice; he got incompetent advice' provided to him by the union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot say that unions are required to give competent advice, but it does seem to me extraordinary that they can spend so much time having internecine wars and yet, when it comes to looking after their workers, they do not do the right thing.

I do not think one could say that unions necessarily look after the best interests of their workers, or necessarily that employers are not looking after the best interests of workers when their workers' interests and their own happen to coincide. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) This question seeks a legal opinion which is outside the expertise of the Treasurer and the Treasury. The following answer is based upon advice from the Attorney-General's Department. `Misprision of felony' is a common law offence. Whether it still exists in any Australian jurisdictions is a matter for the individual jurisdictions. The Australian Code States (Queensland, WA, Tasmania and the NT), and common law States New South Wales, Victoria and SA have abolished the common law offence of misprision of felony. No equivalent offence exists under the statute law of those jurisdictions. In the ACT the offence does not appear to have been abolished, but the distinction between a misdemeanour and a felony has been abolished, and as a consequence it is unlikely that the offence misprision of felony can apply (see A v Hayden (No 2)(1984) 156 CLR 523 at 552 at 556).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1915, the judgments of Griffith CJ and Isaacs J in R v Kidman (1915 20 CLR 421) raised the question whether there exists any separate common law of the Commonwealth. That question has never been authoritatively resolved. The Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, chaired by the former Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Harry Gibbs, took the view that misprision of felony might apply in relation to a Commonwealth offence that could be identified as a felony and was committed in a State where the common law offence had not been abolished. However, it considered that situation to be unlikely, since no offence under Commonwealth law is described as a felony. It noted that no instance had come to the notice of the Review Committee of a Commonwealth prosecution for misprision of a felony in relation to an offence under Commonwealth law. It recommended that no statutory offence of misprision of a felony be enacted by the Commonwealth, on the assumption that existing offences of accessory after the fact and compounding an offence would be retained, and would be sufficient to meet policy requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, as the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, cannot be criminally liable for a common law offence. The principle that the Crown cannot be criminally liable for a supposed wrong prevails over anything but the clearest expression of intention in a statute (Cain v Doyle (1946) 72 CLR 409; Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v Attorney-General for Ontario [1959] SCR 188).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, the mere fact that a Crown servant is acting in the course of his or her employment will not entitle the servant to the Crown's immunity. If a Commonwealth officer became aware of the commission of a felony in, and under the law of, a jurisdiction where the common law offence of misprision of a felony had not been abolished and failed to disclose that knowledge to the law enforcement authorities of the jurisdiction within a reasonable time and having had a reasonable opportunity to do so, he or she would, as would any person in the same position subject to the laws of the jurisdiction, be liable to prosecution for the common law offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) and (3) The Attorney-General's Department has advised that the `attachments' to the so called `Westpac letters' have never been sought or examined by the Attorney General's Department or any of the Attorney-General's portfolio agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `attachments' to the `Westpac letters' have never been sought or examined by any Treasurer, Attorney General, other Minister, or the Governor of the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Crime Authority (NCA) has never sought or examined the `attachments' to the `Westpac letters'. Recommendation 61 of the Report of the House of Representatives Standing committee on the inquiry into the banking industry, which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 27 November 1991, recommended that the "Westpac letters" be referred to the NCA for investigation into whether any criminal wrongdoings arose from the management of foreign exchange contracts by Partnership Pacific Limited. Following that recommendation, on 3 December 1991, the Attorney General's Department forwarded all relevant material in its possession (including the `Westpac letters' without the `attachments') to the NCA for consideration of what action, if any was warranted on its part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pursuant to the National Crime Authority Act 1984, the NCA has a charter to investigate activity where it amounts to "relevant criminal activity". After consideration of the documentation, the Acting Chairman of the NCA in a letter to the Department dated 1 April 1992, reported that the conduct of Partnership Pacific Limited or any of its employees did not fall within the definition of "relevant criminal activity". No subsequent inquiries were undertaken by the NCA into the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DPP also examined the "Westpac letters" without the attachments. In January 1992, the Assistant Director of the Head Office of the DPP concluded that the material available did not disclose any offence against the Commonwealth, other than possible taxation offences which fell within the investigative responsibilities of other agencies. No further correspondence on the matter was entered into by the DPP after that date.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suspense account was created because the accounting system in existence in PPL at the time necessitated a large amount of paperwork (as many as three or four deal slips for each position created for each client). The suspense account acted as a temporary holding account for those deals, entered into on behalf of certain clients, that PPL found difficult, for purely administrative reasons, to allocate on the deal date. While PPL no longer has the suspense account books, from the transactional documents relating to the amounts transferred into the suspense accounts (that is, from deal slips and dealer position sheets) which are generally available, an independent firm of accountants retained by the Westpac on behalf of PPL has been able to ascertain the total value of the contracts transferred into the suspense accounts, together with the exchange rates and, from this, the suspense accounts have largely been reconstructed. The reconstruction exercise was undertaken so that PPL and its clients can litigate, mediate or negotiate on an informed basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reconstruction has been examined by independent actuaries who have used statistical techniques to examine the certainty of the conclusions drawn in the accountants' reports.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the unavailability of the suspense account books is not something which has adversely affected the position of PPL borrowers, because to the extent that Westpac has been unable to produce those books, those borrowers have argued that an adverse inference should be drawn and these borrowers have used that inference in mediations or negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) It is not a statutory requirement for the Reserve Bank to "monitor the efficacy" of Australian banks or bankers. The Banking Act 1959 makes the Reserve Bank responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and for the protection of banks' depositors. This involves the Reserve Bank in closely monitoring the operations of banks against a range of prudential criteria. The Reserve Bank has no statutory duty in relation to the probity of individual banking transactions. These issues are for the law enforcement authorities, and the courts; the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman and the Code of Banking Practice are relevant to dealings with retail customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) It would be inappropriate for the Treasurer to instruct the Reserve Bank to do anything in relation to the matters raised by Senator Bell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) to (19) The Reserve Bank does not delegate any of its statutory responsibilities to other authorities. It follows from the answer to Question 10 that, since the Reserve Bank was not responsible for investigating matters relating to the `Westpac letters', it has no responsibilities to delegate in this matter. Rather, disputes of this nature (between banks and their customers) are properly matters for the courts, the law enforcement authorities and, in certain cases, the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman. It would be inappropriate for the Government or the Reserve Bank to usurp the judicial function of the courts by intervening in disputes between banks and their customers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Human Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The honourable senator is referring to a meeting hosted in Bangkok by the Economic and Social Committee for Asia and the Pacific, known as ESCAP, to discuss progress made in the Asian Pacific Decade of Disabled Person. As with all relevant ESCAP meetings, Australia was invited to provide a report and send a delegation to this meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not accept every such invitation, but carefully consider whether our presence would have any special value to this country, or to our neighbours in the Asia and Pacific region, and weigh this up against the many other calls on our time and resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Initially my department indicated that we would be represented at the Bangkok meeting. Following further consideration it was decided that the expense involved was not justified in the light of other more pressing calls on funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The ESCAP secretariat was advised that we would regrettably be unable to attend this particular meeting but was assured of our commitment to the Decade. Our report was provided as requested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(a) The meeting was well attended by countries throughout the Asian Pacific region. The main item for discussion was the Agenda for Action which had been set at a previous meeting in 1993. The goals and target dates referred to in the honourable senator's question derive from that agenda for action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Australia contributed to the development of the goals and targets through participation in previous discussions on the Agenda itself, and through continued correspondence with the ESCAP secretariat on issues within the Agenda. It should be noted that Australia is relatively advanced, in any comparison, with Agenda items and goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(a) Australia co-sponsored the resolution which proclaimed the Decade of Disabled Persons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Australia had already committed itself to the Agenda for Action and the draft goals and target dates. Only minor variations to the goals and target dates came out of the meeting. Like other countries, we have taken the time following the meeting to consider these, and I am pleased to advise the honourable senator that we do commit ourselves to these. As was noted earlier, Australia is already relatively advanced against these goals and targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) This Government will certainly maintain its commitment to the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons. The level of our further participation will be considered as opportunities arise and in the context of this commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Government already provides substantial funds to peak consumer groups to represent the interests of people with a disability and would encourage those groups to consider how they can support the Decade when making decisions about their expenditure priorities. Several representatives of disability consumer groups in fact attended the Bangkok meeting, and I would hope that these people continue their active involvement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) This provision is not intended to restrict exports but rather to ensure that when exports are undertaken, there is a person in Australia responsible for the action. An Australian resident is required to do this to ensure that there is traceability in the event of recall action; that the exporter and not the manufacturer is responsible for any defects in the product, caused for example by incorrect storage or transportation, and also to provide a specific deterrent to drug counterfeiting of products included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, without an Australian sponsor for each export action, Australian manufacturers of pharmaceuticals have no knowledge of where their products are being directed, the conditions in which they arrive, and the promotional activity undertaken in regard to those products in the country of sale.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) and (2) The issue of funding for dementia specific facilities must be placed in context. Dementia specific facilities are one care option for residents with dementia, involving segregation of residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Facilities of this type represent around 5% of places available in nursing homes and hostels, and yet 50-80% of residents of nursing homes and hostels generally have some identified cognitive or behavioural deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other successful models of care operating across the industry. The common elements of good dementia care are informed management, staff trained in dementia, good care practices and programs and involvement of families. Appropriate physical design is one other factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government works to actively support all these elements, through funding, training programs and research. Over the last decade, we have substantially increased funding for hostels, including dementia specific hostels, from $40 million to $310 million per year. Personal care funding, which covers the care needs of people with dementia, has tripled in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The current formula, used to determine aged care funding, does take account of care needs associated with cognitive deficits and challenging behaviours, as well physical frailty. Nevertheless, we are looking at how well the residential care classification and funding systems identifies the care needs of people with very challenging behaviours. (See also (5)).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) I am not aware of any facilities which have closed; I understand one facility in Victoria is in the process of converting to a general hostel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) I am aware, that some operators of dementia specific facilities report that they are having difficulties within current funding arrangements. Part of the problem appears to be that some dementia specific facilities, that are part of a wider complex, are isolated from the broader infrastructure of the organisation and run as a separate cost centre. This approach can lead to significant inefficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some other organisations that have chosen to include dementia specific units within the overall structure of a general aged care facility have been able to provide an excellent service within current funding arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have, however, given a firm commitment to change the existing resident classification and funding arrangements in the next Budget to ensure better identification and funding of the care of people with very challenging behaviours and in particular for those who are also ambulant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making such changes, however, the Government is strongly committed to an equitable funding solution.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The `rule of thumb' (strips less than 400 metres not to be accredited) was generally adopted for consideration of linear reserves, but with the caveat that individual circumstances would need to be closely examined (it may, for instance, only be possible to represent certain forest types in this way). In Tasmania the Commonwealth has also accepted inclusion of narrow linear reserves where exclusion of these reserves is not technically possible and their contribution is minor (12% of the total reserve system).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) (a) The `rule of thumb' was developed by technical officers from a number of Commonwealth agencies involved in the Deferred Forests Assessment (DFA) process.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Victoria has an extensive system of non-statutory reserves. However, these comprise a range of areas of different shapes that had been set aside from logging for specific conservation purposes. These areas do include some linear connecting corridors. In contrast, the non-statutory forest reserves in WA consist predominantly of narrow linear road river and stream reserves, and these comprise a substantial proportion of the total reservation area (e.g. 20% of reserved Jarrah is in linear strips and stream buffers).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with Tasmania and New South Wales, Victoria has taken a different approach to deferred forests areas than Western Australia. Victoria will protect all areas outside an agreed Wood Utilisation Plan pending the conclusion of Regional Forest Agreements. Accordingly, the DFAs in Victoria are very large and the issue of administration reserves is of relatively little significance. Since Western Australia has chosen to proceed with the approach of tightly defined deferred forest areas designed to meet no more than the shortfall in reservation levels, the Commonwealth has needed to ensure that only those administrative reserves that could clearly contribute to a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system are counted for the purposes of the DFA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) In the State wide analysis of 19 broad forest types, administration reserves were discussed in relation to one forest type (lowland forest) which was 13% protected in formal reserves and 3% protected in special protection zones which included linear components. As outlined in the response to part four of the question, the issue of linear reserves which were less than 400 metres is of lesser importance in Victoria because of the approach used in the DFA process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) No, for reasons outlined in parts four and five of the question. However, the contribution of linear reserves will be considered by governments in more detail in the Comprehensive Regional Assessments process.</PARA>
