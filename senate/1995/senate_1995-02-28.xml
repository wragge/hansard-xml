<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. I refer to the government's intention to further tax workers with a compulsory superannuation levy of three per cent. The minister is no doubt aware that ACOSS calculates that this levy will cost an individual worker on average earnings $16 a week and a couple with children on the median income $20 a week. I ask: have you or your department assessed ACOSS's calculations? Has the government estimated the impact on families of another tax hike? Would you inform us of any studies you have instigated regarding the consequences of this further tax levy on individuals and families?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question, dealing with matters of tax, is just as properly directed to my colleague Senator Cook. In terms of what this government has done for families, we stand absolutely and very proudly on our commitment to families and to enabling families to have sufficient income. The best way we have done that is by the Working Nation statement and job creation. There is absolutely no doubt that that is the preferred way of creating income security for  families and ongoing income to enable families to make those choices. When you add that to our policies through social security for targeted and directed payments to families, you see that we have nothing to blush about at all in terms of families. As to proposals about taxation and any of the suggestions you have talked about&mdash;that is, superannuation and so on&mdash;that is a good trawl for what might or might not be in the budget. I am certainly not going to add to speculation.</PARA></TALK.START>

We want to know what contribution you have been making to this debate by assessing the impact upon families of the government's proposed superannuation levy. Everyone knows that the government is considering in depth a tax hike in the form of a superannuation levy. What we want is not speculation on what might happen; we want to know whether you have been contributing to that debate by assessing the consequences of those proposals on families. Have you done that work?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. Last week the media reported on the release by the minister of a discussion paper on the Australian trade framework. I understand the document, titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Winning markets: the next step</EMPHASIS>, will be circulated broadly to Australian industry and unions for comment. Will the minister elaborate on the purpose of this exercise and what he intends to gain from it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jones is, of course, correct that last week I released to the Trade Policy Advisory Council, which is the peak industry advisory group in the Trade portfolio, the discussion paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Winning markets: the next step</EMPHASIS>. It was only the first step in an extensive process of consultation that I intend to undertake with Australian business, unions and interest groups on Australia's trade policy into the future. The next step will involve round table meetings in state capitals over the next month and consultations with peak organisations, such as the National Farmers Federation, the ACTU, the BCA and the ACCI. It is important that we do have this consultation, that we do give a range of people an opportunity to contribute, because winning markets is at the heart of Australia's economic future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like all policy papers, this is not trying to cover every issue that might ever influence our trade performance, because that ranges much too broadly for any one useful consultative exercise. This is about the international trade setting. It is not about the relevant and equally important but separate issues of domestic industry policy and domestic economic settings. It is not intended to cover the waterfront of all the issues relating to trade policy. It focuses on the overseas policy environment and how we should best respond to the dramatic changes which are taking place and how we can best use Australia's diplomatic and other resources to influence that environment to win markets for Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some major changes, of course, in the last few years and Australia has made, I think it is widely regarded and accepted, a very effective contribution to those changes. I refer in particular to the outcome of the Uruguay Round and to the implementation of APEC, both of which Senator Jones is interested in. The discussion paper is about building on those achievements and establishing a framework to guide Australia's trade and investment activities well into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes that are taking place in the international trading environment, for example, are the increase in regionalism and the increasing global activity of major corporations, both of which are making the policies of the past no longer necessarily relevant, and we need to review them. We want this process of consultation to be a two-way street. I want to hear what industry has to say about the trade policy framework that we need to have in place to win markets for Australian companies into the next century, but I also want to take the opportunity to broaden and deepen the understanding of the Australian community, and specifically Australian industry and workers, of the very central place of trade policy in Australia's economic welfare. I want to have industries' plans and interests underpinning what we do to provide the best conditions for them, but I also want to communicate to the Australian private sector that it is very important that it focuses on international exports in its corporate plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More and more Australian companies are exporting, but it is still the biggest problem in our trade performance that not enough companies export. Many companies which are capable of exporting are not doing so&mdash;more than ever before, a higher proportion than ever before, but not enough. Therefore, the overriding purpose of the dialogue with industry is to develop a dynamic and proactive trade policy setting that will ensure Australia's future as a trading nation, because our economic performance broadly continues to be limited and affected by the extent to which we can be a successful trading nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. The Tourism Council of  Australia in its pre-budget submission for 1995-96 stated that 70 per cent to 80 per cent of a comprehensively applied bed tax would fall on Australian consumers and over 60 per cent of this would directly hit middle and low income earners.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The South Australians might like to listen to this and the Western Australia's might like to as well, Senator Panizza. Cabinet also agreed to offer financial assistance and support to the Western Australian and South Australian governments to develop and implement regional adjustment strategies for the drought affected regions of the Eyre Peninsula and the Gasgoyne-Murchison area in Western Australia. These regions will benefit from a targeted regional program, similar to that so successfully launched in south-west Queensland in February this year. As senators would be aware, the government is currently providing assistance to drought affected primary producers in Queensland, northern New South Wales and north-eastern Tasmania.

It does put the lie to claims that have been made, particularly by the government of New South Wales, that fewer than 1,000 farmers would qualify for the drought relief payment.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. I refer him to the likely collapse of the Baring Brothers Bank because of the capacity of one rogue employee to make bad investments on the derivatives market. Given that a similar situation here in Australia cost AWA some $50 million back in 1986, can the minister outline how exposed we in Australia are to a collapse occurring here? Is the minister aware of and concerned by a Price Waterhouse study just last year which found that fewer than half of the organisations dealing in corporative derivatives had proper systems to monitor their processes? Does the minister agree that the response of the Australian Securities Commission to call for a voluntary disclosure code for non-bank derivatives traders is an inadequate response to the risk posed by rogue traders to Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1028" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do have some information from the Attorney-General in respect of this particular problem. He advises that, at this stage, he does not have full details of the nature of the collapse. However, he has been advised by the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission that the commission has been assessing as a matter of urgency the collapse and whether that collapse is likely to have an adverse implication for Australian markets. The advice that the Attorney has received from the chairman of the ASC is that the collapse is unlikely to have any significant market effects in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are right, Senator Kernot: following news of the Barings collapse, the ASC did issue a press statement on 27 February reaffirming its concerns, with a lack of explicit financial reporting requirements in Australia, about derivatives for non-bank disclosing entities. It did cite in support of its statement a corporate derivative survey released by the Australian Society of Corporate Treasurers and Price Waterhouse in September 1994, a survey to which you referred. That survey raised concerns about a sizeable gap between treasury staff knowledge and senior management knowledge of derivatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that there are already mechanisms in place. There are safeguards against fraudulent and excessively risky derivatives trading on market, and they are provided by the Sydney Futures Exchange and the Australian Stock Exchange procedures. Amongst the procedures relevant, there are procedures that provide that all traders of derivative products on market are required to be licensed by the ASC. Licensing requirements include proven financial standing and competency expertise to advise on the use of these products as well as standards of honesty and integrity. The procedures involve proper disclosure of the nature of particular transactions. That nature will be given to investors. Fidelity funds provided by the Australian Stock Exchange and SFE are maintained to meet claims by investors in the case of dealer default. As well as that, there are internal procedures for fair and orderly conduct of the market to enable margin calls to be made by the Sydney Futures Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that this is also supported by requirements for traders to report all transactions daily to the relevant exchange. That reporting process can immediately identify trends and risks and, in particular, the need for the exchange to take immediate action to protect the integrity of the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, I think the ASC noted in this regard that a proposed Australian accounting standard dealing with the financial instruments is being developed. That instrument calls for corporate managers to throw their weight behind development of a voluntary code to meet true and fair disclosure requirements pending the finalisation of the standard. The Attorney sees this as a welcome initiative from the ASC, demonstrating an awareness of, and sensitivity to, the regulatory challenges faced by the greater use of derivatives by corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I should make with respect to this is that the issue of effective regulation and supervision of the derivatives industry is also currently under close consideration by the Australian Council of Financial Supervisors, which includes the Reserve Bank, the Australian Securities Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, established under the Australian Securities Commission Act. So, all in all, there are systems in place and systems are being developed. I suspect that this does not fully answer Senator Kernot's question. To the extent that it does not, I will bring it to the notice of the Attorney-General.</PARA>

France now joins Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway and New Zealand as signatories to this agreement which embraces the reciprocal development and enforcement of measures against doping in sport. France is one of the leading anti-doping nations in Europe, and its considerable knowledge and expertise will be immensely valuable to the anti-doping agreement and its programs.</PARA>

I believe, and I hope that all senators would agree, that this is a very important endeavour.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I refer the minister to the application to allow the release of contaminated water from retention pond 2 at ERA's Ranger mine into the river system of Kakadu National Park. I ask, one, is it correct that Ranger uranium mine was designed with a no release system so as to protect the surrounding area from the harmful effects of the pollutants produced during the mining and milling processes at the mine? Two, does the minister agree that the proposal would significantly weaken the environmental safeguards that are in place to protect the Kakadu world heritage area? Three, if so, what action will the minister take to ensure the release of the water does not go ahead? Four, if not, on what factual basis does the minister form his view?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1031" SPEAKER="Faulkner Sen J.P." NAMEID="5K4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ENVIRONMENT, SPORT AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The operator of the Ranger uranium mine, Energy Resources of Australia, has applied to Northern Territory authorities to release water from retention pond No. 2, which is in the restricted release zone. Since mining began, release of water has been limited to the non-restricted release zone; that is, non-contaminated water. Apart from minor accidental spills, shown by the Supervising Scientist to have had negligible environmental impact, restricted release zone water has not been released into Magela Creek in the mine's 15 years of operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fox report into the Ranger uranium mine recognised that some water release would be required during the life of the mine. The mine was not designed to have a no-release management system. The current wet season at Ranger has been the wettest on record and retention ponds there are filled to capacity. Calculations indicate that a wet season the likes of which occurs once in 100 years may be occurring in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989, the government agreed that for very wet seasons&mdash;on average, one every 10 years&mdash;the controlled release of water constituted best practicable technology and should not cause any harm to the environment, provided appropriate conditions were met, such as a minimum creek flow for dilution purposes, a dilution level of water to be based on biological and chemical tests, and a suitable monitoring program in force throughout the release. Any water release from Ranger will be diluted such that the water quality downstream of the mine will not be significantly different from the quality of the natural water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extensive testing by the Environment Research Institute of the Supervising Scientist shows that water released from Ranger will not harm the natural ecosystem or pose a threat to the health of people living or gathering foods downstream of the mine. It therefore, I believe, does not weaken in any way the safeguards that protect the Kakadu world heritage area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Supervising Scientist has provided advice to the Northern Territory as to conditions under which he considers the proposed release would not have significant environmental impacts. The final decision concerning the application by ERA to release water from Ranger mine in fact rests with the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Is it true that the mine cannot function without the frequent release of contaminated water from the site? What action does the minister intend taking to protect the  environment at Kakadu from the radioactive accumulation in the land, water and food chain? The minister has talked about a monitoring program. How will that monitoring program assess the effect on those features&mdash;the land, the water and the food chain&mdash;and on the people in that area?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Human Services. I refer her to the minister for health's recent comments that there is presently an oversupply of general practitioners in Australia. Surely it is more correct to say that there is a major maldistribution of GPs so that the  larger population areas are very well serviced while many regional and remote Australians still find it very difficult to get the access to the family doctor that city dwellers take for granted. Can the minister explain why, after 12 years in office, the government's general practice initiatives for regional Australia, including relocation and training assistance and the practice grants scheme, have been so unsuccessful? What specific new plans does the government have to address this worsening problem for regional Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You cannot conclude that because there is a maldistribution there is not an oversupply. On the figures&mdash;and I do not have them to hand; I will certainly see if I can find them for you&mdash;compared to other countries and per head of population you could clearly argue that Australia has an oversupply of general practitioners. But there is no doubt&mdash;I think it is very well understood and I have certainly said it in this place before&mdash;that there is a very distinct maldistribution of those general practitioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The points you raise are entirely right. It is very difficult to get a sufficient number of GPs to work in rural Australia, particularly remote rural Australia. That is why the government has, over the last few years, instituted a number of processes to make every effort to encourage general practitioners to take the opportunity to do their general practice in rural and remote Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of initiatives and they are already beginning to make some difference. Clearly not enough difference&mdash;and again I can check those figures for you&mdash;but there has been a number of doctors who have taken up the resettlement packages and the financial assistance the government provides to doctors to help with the cost of moving into the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other areas that I think are a continuing matter for discussion between rural general practitioners and the government. One is the need perhaps to change undergraduate training and certainly post-graduate training for general practitioners so that they have a different confidence about dealing with a number of the processes and procedures they may face in the country, which has been said to be one of the reasons for a lot of general practitioners not wanting to go to the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area of particular concern is the locum arrangements. How does a general practitioner get any rest, relief or break from the practice if they cannot find a locum service? Both of those are matters of concern and discussion between government and the general practitioners, particularly rural general practitioners. It is important to know that the problem is well recognised by government. The assistance and particularly the significant contribution&mdash;</PARA>

I will find those figures for you about the number of doctors who have taken those packages and, again, the initiatives by government in working closely with the rural general practitioner associations about training, not only undergraduate training but also in-service training, and practice grants to assist further that distribution.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is the minister able to confirm that this is the world's largest, most influential and most respected exhibition for this industry, with over 6,000 exhibitors and an expected three-quarters of a million visitors?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Loosley for his question. It is true that the CeBIT fair in Hanover is the world's biggest trade fair in information technology and in telecommunications technology and therefore is a prime target in the promotion of Australia's capability in those fields. As Senator Loosley has said in his question, 6,000 exhibitors and three-quarters of a million visitors will go to this fair and it is an ideal opportunity for Australia to market its potential in this vital field and growth area for Australian industry. It is true that each year the organisers of the CeBIT fair select a country partner. In 1995 the country partner is Australia and we will be the focal point of the fair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, will open the Australian exhibit on the first day of the fair, 8 March. The fair runs from 8 March to 15 March, and 160 Australian information technology companies will attend and exhibit at the fair. These companies will be demonstrating the diversity of Australia's skill and capability in delivering sophisticated, world-class, high-tech solutions for industry. Australia is, of course, a very strong performer in this field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CeBIT 95 will also present Australia's case for a key investment location in this part of the world. It is not generally realised that Australia's share of the information technology and telecommunications market is, excluding Japan, 50 per cent of all software services in this area of the world&mdash;the Asia-Pacific region. We are twice the size of the next largest market, Korea. In the 10 years since 1985, our exports of high technology products have grown by a factor of five&mdash;an outstanding achievement for this industry, but even more so for an industry built entirely upon the intelligence and skill of the people who work in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Information Industries Association, which is the industry body for information technology, recently imposed on itself an export target for the industry which, if reached, will see exports of information technology and telecommunications products and services reach $A10 billion by the end of this decade. That will be equivalent to the exports we already have out of this country in coal and iron ore. It is, therefore, interesting to see a highly technological industry creating an export market equivalent to one of the staple commodities&mdash;coal and iron ore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exhibitors who have made the commitment to participate in this year's fair are to be congratulated for grasping this opportunity. To assist those exhibitors to get their message across, the government has helped to develop the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Intelligent Australia</EMPHASIS> CD-ROM and the CeBIT touch screen information system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Defence and relates to the awarding of the overhaul contract for GE404 engines in the RAAF's F18s to Air New Zealand. Is the minister aware that Air New Zealand has recently suffered four engine failures in engines it has overhauled and has been forced to ground 10 of its Boeing 737s as a consequence? What financial penalties are written into the RAAF contract against shoddy workmanship or premature engine failures? Given the fact that the government has transferred a vital defence capability offshore, how is the RAAF to have any surge capacity in an emergency? Air New Zealand demonstrably has none, because it will take until the end of June to overhaul a few engines for its Boeings. Finally, was the RAAF contract in any way a sweetener for the abrogation of the MOU on joint air services between Australia and New Zealand?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This particular contract went out to tender. Senator MacGibbon would be well aware that, as part of that, New Zealand has taken those tenders in support of Australian defence industry. It is part of the Anzac ship frigate treaty, it is part of closer economic relations&mdash;and so that is treated as in the same market. It is always disappointing as an Australian nationalist when an Australian firm does not win. But, of course, on many occasions Australian firms win work under the same conditions from New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the technical capacity of Air New Zealand, that was obviously a matter that the RAAF gave maximum attention to. It had to satisfy itself that Air New Zealand had the capacity technically to be able to deliver on a contract such as this.

Senator Coulter is aware of the fact that, at this stage in the lead-up to the first conference of the parties to the framework convention on climate change, the government is examining the adequacy of its existing national greenhouse response, and that is a matter that is to be addressed by cabinet in the near future.

Those interested senators will recall that on 16 February, Mr Lee sought to break the logjam between Australis and Channel 9 by suggesting a compromise of 12 hours exclusivity, which Channel 9 accepted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exclusivity is, as has been stated, the stumbling block for Channel 9. Australis, however, has already agreed that this will not set a precedent for future negotiations and so the minister has put forward the view that there is room for agreement on this matter because this should be seen as a unique case. There is a dispute between the Broadcasting Authority and Australis as to whether the West Indies tour rights were secured before the list took effect.

<PARA>Senators will remember that Senator Collins, in response to my interjection, referred to me as Senator Big Mouth. I wear that with some pride. I do not mind having a big mouth on these issues, particularly when the government has ignored the needs of the people in the Upper Hunter for four years. I would like to remind the Senate that this drought has now been going on in many areas of Australia, including New South Wales, for the last four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response has been pathetic. It did not really come up with any policy or response till September last year. Then when it realised that it had left out the vast majority of the needy people, particularly in New South Wales, it had another go at it. It had a go in December of last year and it got it wrong again&mdash;it got it very badly wrong. All of a sudden the seats that were marginal got drought relief. The poor old Upper Hunter just happened to be in an area that is held by the National Party or Labor, depending on the state and federal boundaries. There was no chance of it being a marginal seat, so 1,000 farming families in the Upper Hunter have missed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I visited and spoke to these people in late December last year and we decided we would put together a delegation to go and see the minister. It is a pity the minister has not visited the Upper Hunter because he would realise the plight the farmers in that area are in. The minister's policy does not distinguish between the subtleties of the type of country that is affected by drought. The main characteristic of the Upper Hunter is that it is excellent country that tends to hold on very well in a drought. The farmers hope it will rain in the next few weeks. The country is good so they can hold on longer than farmers in other areas. When it finally does give way and it is in an area where they cannot feed their stock, they have got to sell off stock at the lowest price in the market. So they are doubly disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main problem with the government's policy is that it has come up with a number of very crude measures to work out who is in drought that do not take into account the subtleties that I have indicated. One of them is that the gross rainfall pattern in the area does not take into account the way in which rainfall is distributed over time. So what can happen, as did happen in the Upper Hunter, is that some of the areas got a quarter of their annual rainfall in several days. This created flooding in streams, it washed away fences, and 10 days later the country was all dry again. Some other areas in the Upper Hunter did not get that at all. It is an area that is in desperate straits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There has been very little assistance from this government. There has, fortunately, been assistance from the Fahey government, but in terms of the extreme drought classification, which should be obvious to the minister, this area has been left out again. I was delighted to hear today the minister include a number of areas around Australia, and given that we have put the position of the Upper Hunter to him very clearly and given that he has had a delegation in his office to explain it to him word by word, he has still left this area out. I am surprised that areas get in and this area is left out. I know it is under consideration by a group which the minister hopes will report some time soon. The drought has gone on for four years now and almost three months have gone by since we first asked him for the classification. </PARA>

Senator Tierney, across the top of your non-stop interjections, the criticism is directed at the package of assistance provided by the government of New South Wales, not by the federal government. More particularly, could I say to you that, in the answer that I gave during question time today, I referred your attention&mdash;and you will not bother to read it&mdash;to the public accounts committee of the New South Wales parliament that has just reported on the record of the New South Wales government in drought assistance for its own drought affected farmers.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am pleased to say that there was an instant improvement as a result of the pressure that was applied to the New South Wales government in relation to its approval rate of applications. The approval rate actually went up from 49.3 per cent to 68.9 per cent, but it is still behind the national average.

<PARA>The reason I raise this matter is that I have genuine concerns about the capability of Air New Zealand to support the RAAF with engine overhauls. It has experienced four failures in recent times of a very old and very reliable engine. The Pratt and Whitney JT8D series of engine, which goes back at least 30 years, is a very simple and robust engine. As long as the engines are properly overhauled and maintained they are utterly reliable, never fail and just keep on going. That is the engine that has made jet travel around the world. To have lost four engines in a short time&mdash;engines that were all apparently overhauled by Air New Zealand&mdash;is a very worrying situation. Air New Zealand must be very concerned about this because it has grounded 10 of its Boeing 737-200 series, which is a large proportion of its internal fleet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have very great concerns about transferring defence resources offshore. I understand what Senator Ray is saying: Australia and New Zealand are now regarded as one market. But I think the government was quite careless and remiss in not thinking through that agreement with respect to what I would call vital assets in defence before it signed. Some things in Australia have to stay within Australia for our own security. Within the commercial support program, the CSP, which transfers maintenance out of the uniformed services into the civilian world, the services retain what they regard as core or essential capabilities. By the same token, there is a real argument to retain some capabilities which we regard as essential within Australia. In a defence emergency, we are the only people who will look after this country. The New Zealanders will not be anywhere in sight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that concerns me about Senator Ray's answer&mdash;he made this point in answer to Senator Woods, and I have heard him make the same point in numerous estimates hearings&mdash;is his comment that Air New Zealand has the capability to undertake these overhauls. I do not doubt that for one moment. It has the potential to do it, but the point is that it is not a reality. What Air New Zealand is dealing with in the JT8D, which it seems to be quite unsuccessful with, is a very old, very simple and robust engine. The engine that we want it to overhaul&mdash;the General Electric 404&mdash;is a very sophisticated, modern, high performance engine. It is an engine not used in the sedate life of a passenger aircraft with a long life under steady and predictable conditions. It is used in a tactical fighter, which is the most robust environment you can subject any engine to. Both the quality of the engine and the quality of the overhauls and maintenance have to be in the highest order for them to succeed. What Air New Zealand is talking about is potential. All I can say to that is that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to another concern I have with the government. So many of the defence contracts we have seen this government write on major maintenance or in construction areas have been grossly deficient in protecting the interests of the Commonwealth. I do not need to spend much time in the Senate today talking about the huge exposure of the Australian Commonwealth in the Collins submarine program as I have done it so many times in the past. Somewhere near 90 per cent of the contract price has been paid out of about $4 or $5 billion, and we have not yet got one of the ships. The only defence that Senator Ray can offer for that is that the reputation of the prime contractor, a Scandinavian company, is such that it would not want to fail by defaulting on the contract. I can tell Senator Ray that, if there is a default of a few hundred million dollars&mdash;let alone a few billion dollars, which may be the exposure ultimately under the Collins contract&mdash;the company will walk away from it&mdash;but fast. It will blame the Australian government and the Australian Department of Defence for its problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned about what protection the RAAF and the Department of Defence have in relation to these engines that will be overhauled by Air New Zealand. We had 75 of those aircraft. We have lost two of them, so we now have 73. We probably have a pool of engines approaching 200. In any emergency, we have to know that we can have those engines supported. I believe that it is one of the vital assets that we need in this country to underpin the Australian defence forces. The government ought to revise its policy of transferring those vital assets offshore. </PARA>

That is what it says it tries to do. But the legislation does not ensure it at all. The legislation simply says that a commercial channel has to be given the right to show it. That commercial channel could be at Wyndham in Western Australia. One small regional television station could get the rights, which means that pay TV would then be entitled to run it and the normal viewers in Sydney, for example, would have no access unless they went to pay TV.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion relating to the order of business on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, namely, a motion to give precedence to government business order of the day No. 16, relating to the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>If I am successful in having standing orders suspended, it is my intention to move that the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill be called on as the first item of government business today. This is an unusual procedure that has been forced upon the opposition because it seems that the government is abandoning what is an important piece of legislation during the process of that legislation in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That bill, as you will remember, Mr Deputy President, was in the committee stage in this chamber before Christmas and then by resolution of this place was taken out into the community through the relevant committee. The committee members of this Senate spent the best part of January visiting indigenous communities throughout Australia conferring upon the amendments that had already been passed and amendments that were foreshadowed and took an enormous amount of very valuable evidence largely confirming the need, which the opposition had suspected, for change to the government's bill. You will remember also, Mr Deputy President, that we have been long arguing the importance of this particular bill to address the primary issues of education, health, housing and jobs for the</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal community and our determination to include appropriate provisions within the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind you, finally, that in the last sitting fortnight, which was the first sitting fortnight of this year, the committee brought back its report to this parliament. Its report was put down in this place and the whole of Australia as well as this Senate was better informed as a result. Therefore, what we expected in the normal course of events was that the government would then call on its piece of legislation and the debate would continue to finality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reason to believe that the bill will be passed. That has been the success story of the process of amendments through the committee stage. Astonishingly, the government apparently has decided to abandon this process and start it all again at the other end of the building, because the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) introduced another bill today arguing that the Senate has failed to pass this bill. He argued that the Senate has failed to pass it, when the government is making a choice of its volition that it not be proceeded with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not bringing it on, as we have expected and as has appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, and is leaving it to the opposition to bring on the government's own business. We are prepared to do so because we believe bills that are brought to the Senate and that have received the proper attention of the Senate should be debated to their conclusion and, if they can be passed, should be passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are, as I said a few minutes ago, vitally concerned about the deplorable record of education, health, social security, jobs and housing of Aboriginal communities in Australia. Time and time again, statements that must do nothing but embarrass Australia as to the record of this government in a critical area of public policy have been put on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to do something about it. We want to see this bill passed. We have made an enormous effort to put it into a form in which it can be passed. But rather than have it passed and have the government address the amendments of this place, the government is apparently abandoning it by using a cynical trick to try to argue that it has taken the first step towards a double dissolution. The way in which this Prime Minister normally operates shows that the government is more interested in the next election than the welfare of the Aboriginal community of Australia. We are not prepared to be part of that cynicism. We are calling upon the government to show its colour and be prepared to debate its own legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we have moved this motion this afternoon and, hopefully, as a result of this motion, when we get to government business, the ATSIC bill will be the first bill called on. It should not take long before the final amendments that arose out of the Senate's own committee process can be dealt with and, therefore, the matter can be further progressed. When it goes back to the House of Representatives in the normal way, the government can then react upon it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the Prime Minister regards this place as an irrelevancy in what he regards as the legislative process, but that is not the attitude of the Australian people. The Australian people see that we have a responsibility to properly process government legislation, and we will meet that responsibility. We have done it in this bill. We have produced a better bill as a result of the amendments of this Senate, and we want that bill to be completed and go back to the other chamber to be dealt with in the normal course of events. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is given at the first reading.

At the moment, we have given a precedence of order, which includes the appropriation bills and others. Obviously Senator Hill, concerned about the possibility of going to a double dissolution, seeks to in some way pre-empt that by this move today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, it has been a tradition accorded to governments that they consider their legislation in the order in which they consider necessary to transact business.

We cannot ever support that particular process, no matter what his motives are, be they good or bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Hill does not like the order in which the business of the chamber is going, then of course he has the right to make those political points in that he thinks precedence should be given in the general political argument from one piece of legislation to another.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chamber was informed by the government by way of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and by way of a speech in this place by the minister responsible, the Leader of the Government, Senator Evans, on the last sitting day of the last sitting fortnight, that this legislation would be dealt with in the Senate expeditiously, that he would go away and look at the committee's report and consider the amendments recommended by the committee. So we came back to this place expecting to deal with this legislation yesterday. That is what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> told us and that is what the minister had told us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only because a journalist from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> cared to read what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had said on Friday at a private little meeting at Hope Vale that we were given any clue that the government was prepared to use the cynical political ploy of introducing an identical piece of legislation&mdash;I emphasise, an identical piece of legislation&mdash;incorporating some of the less contentious amendments which had been recommended by the Senate select committee and passed by this Senate. After hearing late on Sunday night, Perth time, from that very astute journalist from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> that the government intended to do that, I made some inquiries yesterday in an attempt to find out what the government was proposing to do and was told basically to `go hunt'&mdash;and that is the politest way of putting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were astonished that the government was prepared to go down this track&mdash;absolutely astonished. The effect of what the government is proposing to do by bringing a new bill into the House of Representatives which is identical to the old one and which incorporates some of the amendments is of course for its own political purposes, ignoring the purposes, hopes and aspirations of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians whom the bill seeks to serve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our wanting to ensure that the land fund bill receives the consideration of the Senate and then the consideration of the House of Representatives once the Senate passes the bill as amended, we have the normal process available to us; that is, that the Senate consider the modifications to the amendments that the Senate select committee has recommended&mdash;those amendments have been prepared and will be circulated subsequently, if this motion is passed&mdash;for there to be a third reading of this bill and for the government then to consider its approach to the amendments in due course in the House of Representatives when the bill leaves this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Prime Minister is proposing, by introducing a new bill in the House earlier today, creates an unnecessary delay in the processing of the land fund bill. As Senator Hill said earlier, it just means that the whole process starts over again: the bill comes back to the Senate; we go through the second reading stage again; we go through the committee stage again; and some time down the track we get back to the point where we are right now here in the Senate, and deal with the committee stage and the third reading once again&mdash;at which stage it will have to go back to the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the strategy put down by the Prime Minister has only one motivation; that is his own political motivation, a motivation which is entirely separated from the motivations, hopes and aspirations of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The government has argued that the Senate, back in December, by referring the bill to a committee, failed to pass the legislation. It was interesting to note that Senator Gareth Evans, in his own contribution to the debate on the Senate select committee's report, commended the committee for the expeditious way in which it had handled its deliberations and for being able to report to the Senate within a couple of days of the ordered reporting date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the committee proceeded expeditiously and fairly in consultation with Aboriginal people and reported back to the Senate. We fully expected to debate the legislation and were prepared to do so when the Senate sat yesterday afternoon. We are surprised at the political ploy of the government. Senator Ray talked about the forms of the Senate and traditions in this place. The government has thrown those traditions out the window. It has chosen to use a cheap political tactic for its own political advantage. Senator Hill is proposing to ensure that the traditional process of ordering the legislation through this place is adhered to. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate that the Greens (WA) support the motion of suspension for the following reasons. It is extraordinary that the government is actually introducing another land fund bill in the House of Representatives today when the government's land fund bill is still before the Senate at the committee stage prior to its third reading vote. The only requirement to complete the Senate's consideration of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 is for the government to place the bill back on the Senate's program. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) considered it constitutional impertinence for the Senate to interfere with the House of Representatives program. Presumably, he will see it as equal impertinence to interfere with the Senate's program in the way that is currently being attempted by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for urgent suspension is that the Senate  should be allowed to proceed with its committee stage consideration of the bill. The government is the only obstacle to the passage of the bill. It may well be embarrassed to continue the debate in the Senate, because the government may not want to pass the amendments and gain a bipartisan approach to its land fund. I believe that that is not in the national interest and that it is not necessarily in the interests of the Aboriginal people who seek that land fund. Alternatively, it may well be forced to eat its words regarding the opposition's stance on the land fund for Aboriginal people who are unlikely to gain any land via the Native Title Act. I think the government's tactic is disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray said that the government had been given no notice of this suspension and called it an ambush. I would like to know what Senator Ray calls the introduction of a repeat bill in the House of Representatives when the present bill is simply awaiting modified amendments that emerged as a result of the committee process. The government may be abandoning its consideration of this bill. It is not up to the government but the Senate to determine what it will consider. By his actions, the Prime Minister is not only indicating his well-noted contempt of the Senate and the parliamentary consideration of legislation; he is also indicating contempt for all the Aboriginal people who appeared before the committee, expressed their concerns about the unamended form of the bill and asked for some redress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of moving to the committee stage of the debate today is to ensure that some of the concerns raised by Aboriginal people around Australia can be addressed by possibly modifying or putting new amendments. Those amendments would meet the concerns expressed by Aboriginal groups around the country and the government. To try to pre-empt that is, in my view, totally undemocratic and unworthy of a government that seems to be attempting to rule by the executive. I therefore support the motion for suspension. I have already indicated support for the proposition that the committee stage be proceeded with prior to the rest of the government business orders of the day at an appropriate time to give consideration to that matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition and, it seems, the Greens have been engaged in nothing more than a time wasting exercise so far as this committee enterprise was concerned. That is evident from the way in which the committee report has come back to us, because the report of the committee involves recommendations that constitute no more than very minor changes to the terms of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill in the form in which it left this place and went off to be further considered by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those circumstances, it has been made perfectly clear that, if the committee stage were to now proceed and this original bill were to go to a third reading, the product would still be a bill that is manifestly unacceptable to the House of Representatives. Why it would be unacceptable has been made perfectly clear by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in introducing the second version of this bill in the House of Representatives today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting it perfectly straightforwardly, the government's position is this: the Senate had ample opportunity to state its position, to consider its position, to debate its position. It did so at enormous length in the latter part of last year, and when it came to the point of passing the legislation in the Senate last year&mdash;after that enormously extended process&mdash;the Senate failed to do so. It failed to pass the legislation. It sent it back to the House of Representatives in a form that was manifestly unacceptable to the House of Representatives. That was made clear to the Senate. When the Senate was confronted with that result, the Senate failed to pass the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those circumstances the government has waited for a period of three months, as the constitution requires, has reintroduced the original bill with a number of the amendments that have been passed by the Senate&mdash;those amendments, in other words, which are acceptable, which do not offend the basic principles of the legislation and which do not make it unworkable&mdash;and has incorporated them accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, after the expected process in the House of Representatives, will come to us for further consideration after next week. It will be an opportunity then to consider the matters of substance that people in the Senate seem to continue, understandably, to want to debate. So there will be an opportunity to do that. Senators will have an opportunity to put that on the record. We will have lost nothing in the process by following the government's preferred position on this, and that process will reflect the reality that the Senate has had its say on the bill and has failed to pass the bill in the form in which we want it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that, if those opposite pass this particular motion now, as it appears they have the numbers to do, we will find ourselves dealing with the first bill, and so be it. We will deal with it in the committee stage. Those opposite have already foreshadowed what the results of that committee stage will be; namely, the passage of the bill on its third reading with some further amendments, one or two minor amendments, which do not do any particular further damage to the bill, although they might even marginally improve it, but which nonetheless do not go in any way to the substantive difficulties that we have and always have had with this legislation&mdash;fundamental difficulties of principle, fundamental difficulties that go to the unworkability of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite are wasting time by going through this particular process because they are doing nothing more than working out a process that is preordained to produce yet another stalemate between the two houses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset let me say that any delay in this matter is occasioned by the government. Today the government is stopping the bringing on of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill so that we can get on with it and debate the amendments and, more importantly, the modifications which the coalition and the Greens have arrived at as a result of the thoroughly exhaustive committee process which was conducted expeditiously over the Christmas break. There was no ploy in referring this matter to a select committee. In fact the government seems to think that is a failure to pass. I say to the people of Australia that it is obvious the government thinks that this legislation is so insignificant and that the Aboriginal people are so insignificant that they do not merit a select Senate committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was initially referred to the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee when a good many problems were realised in relation to this bill. It was after consideration during debate that the coalition and the Greens arrived at the decision, along with the support of Senator Harradine, that this merited a full-scale inquiry because of the lack of consultation by the government. If the government had consulted properly across the Aboriginal community and the Torres Strait Islander community in the first place there would not have been a need to refer this to a select committee. That was the reason for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that 12,000 mile trip, the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill indeed discovered that the vast majority of Aboriginal communities and individuals who were listened to had not been consulted. What is more, out of some 84 Aboriginal community based organisations only 19&mdash;less than 25 per cent&mdash;supported the ATSIC line. That vindicated the reason for the select committee. It vindicated the calling of this committee. That can hardly be called a failure to pass. Senator Gareth Evans knows very well that when he first raised this the constitutional commentators and the press did not agree with his version of events that this was a failure to pass. In fact, it was laughed at across the country and the committee was recognised as exercising due process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is not due process is what the government has done in the other place in introducing an identical bill with the adoption of one or two minor amendments adopted by the coalition. Of those amendments, four of them were canvassed during the committee stage. So it would seem that the committee process was not that fruitless after all, because the government has now adopted them. The government has now put that in this other bill which is in the other place. That is as a result of the committee process. If you go to the Governor-General and tell him that you adopted four amendments in this bill from that committee, that could hardly be called a failure to pass. It was an exercise in due process. What is going on in the other place is absolute rape and pillage of the due process of the conduct of bills in that place and this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very grateful to the Senate for allowing this matter of public importance. I am not going to talk much on the scientific evidence for the greenhouse related climate change. There have been several reports in the last few days. A cooperative effort by the CSIRO, Germany's Max Planck Institute and the US Office of Interdisciplinary Earth Studies said that, even if we succeeded in stabilising emissions at 1990 levels, greenhouse gases would continue to increase and would probably double by 2100. Another report by Dr Thompson, a mathematician from AT&amp;T Bell, to be published in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Science</EMPHASIS> next month, confirms that greenhouse gases have a strong impact on climate change. Information confirming the relation between greenhouse gases and climate change and the mechanism and the severity of the impacts is readily available and convincing for anyone not wilfully blind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen some of the sorts of impacts that are predicted under greenhouse related climate change. The drought not only had a devastating effect on the agricultural industry and rural community but also had a strong effect on the balance of trade and we went to importing food and feed. This is a major unstated cause of the bad current accounts figures recently released. While CSIRO has done some good work in climate modelling, virtually nothing has been done on the impacts of climate change. There are suggestions that we might lose our reefs and already scientists point to bleaching as a result of climate change. Algae are the major sinks of the planet, accounting for about half of the CO2 absorbed by plants each year. The algae are also being affected both by temperature changes and increasing ultraviolet rays due to ozone depletion. This will have massive impacts on oceans already under stress through overfishing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Work done in the United States and Canada indicates that whole forests may die, along with the species that live in them. Other reports suggest that the gulf stream may disappear as a result of differential warming between equatorial and polar regions. The result would be a much colder northern Europe and the devastation of their economies. Basically, we have no idea what we are doing. The result is liable to be disastrous and by the time it is obvious it will be too late to do anything. Biological lag time means things will keep rapidly getting worse for 30 years before remedial action will begin to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that there has never been a conference in Australia where people have brought together information on what is happening or could happen with individual species. We are talking about fish stocks, fish food stocks for birds and terrestrial species. In Australia, there has not been an occasion when scientific researchers and the various people working on that kind of information have come together to share that information. We are acting on a lack of information on species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the National Farmers Federation and support its call for action on retaining forests and promoting agroforestry. We need that and the Greens have already indicated their support for changes to taxation and other regimes that currently work for clearing and should work for preservation and land care. Sinks are not enough when your sources are growing logarithmically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like people to remember this whenever a no regrets policy is mentioned. I agree with a no regrets policy. I have spoken about this on several occasions in this place. The very least the government should be doing is promoting a no regrets policy. But we think we had better broaden that definition very quickly. There is a lot to do if we really want to be in a position in 20 or 30 years time where our inaction is not intensely regretted by us and our children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens are not necessarily wedded to a carbon tax, although industry claims that no nation has one are wrong. Finland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway have carbon taxes as high as $US120 a tonne; that is, $A160 a tonne. But energy use can be reduced dramatically without such a tax as long as there is a political will and a decent integrated program. Is this possible? Absolutely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">California has almost double our population. Between 1980 and 1991 its population increased by 28 per cent, while its absolute electricity use went from 140 terawatts to 104, a decrease of 25 per cent and a decrease on a per capita basis of 41 per cent. Over the same period, the Australian population increased only 17 per cent, while our electricity use increased from 102 terawatts to 159. That is an increase of 55 per cent and a per capita increase of 33 per cent. The Californian economy was booming during that time. I seek leave to table statistics to back up those claims. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How did California do it? It made a commitment to conserve energy. It regulated. It used economic incentives and disincentives. It used building codes and zoning. It assisted industry and householders to retrofit and to put in strong standards. Industry screamed but government ignored it. The result is a win-win situation where industry is thriving and people have reduced cost and increased comfort. The environment is much healthier. Sometimes it is worth seeing that, in these kinds of longer term areas, the concerns of industry do not necessarily relate to the real implications in the medium to long term. They are also far less threatened by international greenhouse measures. After all, they are already much of the way to the goals. We have done nothing, and every year that we do nothing the difficulty becomes greater along with the task.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into what California did or how, but I bring it up to show that there are models. It is possible. Anyone who is interested can look at what California has done, and I recommend that they do. It has been done and there is no reason why we should not do it too. But it will take some political backbone and at least the amount of forward vision possessed by the average five-year-old. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of things can be done and they do not need to be too painful. A study by the former SECV found that energy efficiency programs had the potential to cut national electricity demand by 30 per cent, representing a saving of $3.6 billion in 1992-93 dollars. About half these savings could be achieved in residential and commercial buildings and in their fixed equipment for heating, cooling and lighting. An earlier report showed that such measures could create jobs and add significantly to state gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study by the Goodman Group in 1992 called `Energy efficiency: opportunities for employment' shows that energy efficiency creates more jobs in the economy than fossil fuel power stations. It found that investing in energy efficiency creates 70 per cent more jobs per million dollars invested and that in the United States the $A4.3 billion spent per year on energy efficiency generated an increase of about 80,000 jobs. In other words, efficiency programs are good for the economy; they are not disasters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Programs need to occur at all levels of government, although the federal government has a role to play. On a local level, towns and shires control building codes, zoning, town planning and the basic frameworks that determine what kinds of buildings will be available and how they are arranged. Good urban and town planning can reduce energy use in a number of ways. Building codes can include insulation requirements that not only reduce the need for energy but also, if applied across housing for all income levels, can markedly reduce the drain on low income families whose only alternative is often discomfort in poorly designed, flimsy homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Zoning can mean that infrastructure costs are lower, reducing rates. A combination of carefully controlled, mixed density housing, along with public park space integrating bicycle and walking routes, can mean that transport is cheaper, safer and more pleasant. Higher density does not need to translate into ant-heap style public housing blocks. It can also decrease pollution in the local environment. Urban design that brings shops and services closer to residential areas reduces much of the need for cars. A good public transport system coupled with higher density housing further reduces that need. Many of the most pleasant cities&mdash;San Francisco, Copenhagen and so on&mdash;are designed so that cars are rarely needed. They are a burden rather than a boon, yet businesses do well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this is local government and it brings extra benefits such as greater ease for recycling programs and better returns from them. Recycling will need to go beyond the warm and fuzzy stage of collection bins to look at the harder aspects of assuring that this results in a reduction of use of new resources. This means assuring that the actual resources are regionally recycled into high value products. It also means possibly looking at promoting reuse, reprocess products rather than recycling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal government has a role to play in these areas. There are programs in the housing and regional development portfolio that could support this sort of thing, but there is little in the way of resources and general government commitment behind these programs, in spite of having some very good people on the ground. Little has been done to integrate energy conservation goals into such things as uniform building codes. If people are doubting my concerns, they need to look back to questions I have asked and had answered in the estimates process in regard to federal government housing and why there are no integrated energy or environmental codes built into those. The answer was, `Senator, this is about economic development and not about environment.' I cannot believe the lack of coordination there currently is in a number of programs in not bringing those win-win situations together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State government also has a fundamental role in greenhouse reduction&mdash;as manager of state power utilities, public transport, main roads departments and so on. Obviously, laws restricting the sale of co-generated power into the grids, policies to push the grid into areas where the power sales do not pay for line maintenance, and so on, will work against energy conservation. A lot of urban design has been controlled by state government rather than left to local or regional government. State housing, while funded by the federal government, has been implemented by the state with the result that it has virtually no environmental design and is sited so that poorer people increasingly find themselves pushed to the urban fringes where there is least access to services, clinics, child care, libraries, shops and public transport. The impact of state policies has often worked to undermine both federal and local initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal government cannot wash its hands of its role and responsibility. We currently have federal pressure through the Hilmer plan and other forms to privatise power companies in a way that is likely to lead to competition to underprice power rather than to develop programs to support conservation. We are likely to see a fragmented and unregulated power system rather than one that is responsible. Yet promotion of product standards; assistance to industry in production of energy efficient products, in retrofitting and in developing co-generation capacity; promotion of renewable sources of power; and promotion of industries based on reuse and reprocessing are truly in the federal sphere, as is protection of the general environment and integration of the national greenhouse responses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the problem seems to be this ridiculous argument we have again and again about the constitutional powers of state, federal and local governments, the latter of which seem to be left out of the equation. It is about time we had a proper debate in this country about a new constitution so that people can talk about what they want in terms of those roles and ecological sustainability as a right of every citizen in this country rather than having this ridiculous buck-passing that seems to happen. It should be the responsibility of all tiers of government&mdash;not no tiers of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, there are many opportunities to substantially reduce energy use. I hope the government has the guts and the understanding to take them up and follow through on them better than it has done in the case of the energy card and other programs. I am afraid that, instead, it will let programs like better cities die without replacement. We would prefer a commitment to replace it with a program to integrate government energy objectives at all levels of government and in all programs&mdash;to go from demonstration to practice. The government will be deciding the future of Australia and its greenhouse policy. This can be done in a way that is cost effective and that enables people on lower incomes to have a better standard of living. It can be done in a way that looks to the future rather than just the profits of a few. We will be watching.</PARA>

We accept the need for Australia to participate in the development and implementation of an effective and integrated national and international response to meet the challenge of climate change. That is why the Commonwealth, state and territory governments have set out an integrated package of measures to respond to climate change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the national greenhouse response strategy we have adopted an interim planning target which effectively acts as a yardstick against which the implementation of our greenhouse response can be assessed. It provides a focus for action in Australia and establishes a context in which future planning can be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a phased response in its approach to the greenhouse issue. The first phase was the NGRS, which was adopted in December 1992 by all state and territory governments. The national greenhouse response strategy concentrated on so-called no regrets response measures&mdash;that is, emission reduction measures that have net benefits or, at least, no net cost. These initial measures included a number of insurance measures to reduce uncertainty about climate change impacts. The insurance measures have included studies and research for which the government has provided $6 million each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with the involvement of all the stakeholders, we have established the national greenhouse advisory panel. This has involved key stakeholder groups, including the Business Council of Australia, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace, the Institute of Engineers, the Energy Supply Association of Australia, the Australian Gas Association, the Australian Consumers Association and the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We identified the need to concentrate our attention on energy production, distribution and use because of the contributions to emissions from the energy sector. We placed an emphasis on an integrated least-cost approach to energy planning and on the importance of energy pricing better reflecting economic, social and environmental costs. We undertook to promote greater use of co-generation schemes in energy supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We identified the importance of minimum energy performance standards for appliances and equipment in the household, industrial and commercial sectors. The way is clear for the introduction of national minimum energy performance standards for appliances now that the Victorian government's concerns have been addressed. We also identified the importance of fuel efficiency and improvement in new motor vehicles. So I do believe that the government's approach has been a genuinely integrated one and a responsible one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important part of the Commonwealth's response to the greenhouse issue has been to involve all levels of government, and I believe that is an absolute necessity if we are going to have an effective and integrated response to greenhouse. There really is no other alternative available if we are to have a comprehensive approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national greenhouse response strategy was agreed to by all state and territory governments, and it was also agreed to by the Australian Local Government Association. The national greenhouse response strategy sets out a number of measures that are already under way, particularly in the energy sector, to progress our response to greenhouse. The Commonwealth government has placed a special emphasis on the reform of the national electricity grid and on the introduction of a competitive market in the energy sector. The important challenge is to ensure that the economic objectives of the reform process and the environmental objectives of meeting greenhouse gas targets are integrated and pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of initiatives are under way at state level which reflect the national reform agenda. New South Wales and Victoria are developing internal markets for electricity by separating generation, transmission and distribution and by introducing competitive sourcing of both existing and new sources of supply. Western Australia is considering options to introduce greater competition into its energy market, and today we heard news that the WA government in fact announced the construction of a new co-generation power plant at Kwinana which will use natural gas and result in something like 60 per cent less emissions than would the case with a coal-fired plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that we have taken steps to precisely measure and assess what are the sources of our greenhouse gas emissions in Australia and the impact on particular sectors. That information has provided the basis for the government to determine its further greenhouse response, and we have done that through Australia's greenhouse gas inventory which I was able to release in September of last year. The greenhouse gas inventory forms part of Australia's national communication which is required under the framework convention on climate change. The inventory is very comprehensive. It covers the full range of greenhouse gases. It covers emissions from all sources, large and small, from power stations to lawn-mowers and from aviation to off-road vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inventory was very important in identifying the need for Australia to develop an additional set of response measures. The inventory identified emissions in the energy sector&mdash;about half of our total emissions&mdash;as making the largest contribution to Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions. It also identified that Australia's emissions are projected to grow by 82 megatons between 1990 and the year 2000. Of those, 66 million tonnes are expected to result from a growth in emissions in the energy sector. That sector obviously warrants significant attention in our efforts to reduce emissions in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the inventory has provided a very useful tool with which we can develop an appropriate set of response measures. The government will be giving due consideration to the information made available through the inventory in determining the nature of its enhanced greenhouse response. Industry has recognised the scope for additional measures in the energy sector and there is certainly considerable scope for new measures to result in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in that sector. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I did not hear Senator Faulkner indicate how his urgings were going in cabinet, but I suspect they were not going terribly well.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I do hope is that Senator Faulkner and our part-time Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who seem to be going to attend that meeting take the Australian public and this parliament into their confidence before they go making announcements in Berlin. It would be very nice for the part-time Prime Minister to make an announcement and indicate the strategy Australia will take before he makes an announcement in Berlin without consulting the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be interesting to see the Australian contingent in Berlin. Senator Faulkner has completely lost the confidence of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has recently dismissed Senator Faulkner as far as the environment and the forest policy is concerned and put Senator Collins in charge of that. Obviously relations are not very good amongst our contingent overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is necessary to keep this whole question in perspective. Whilst we are said to be the fourth largest per capita emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, we are fairly small fry in the overall world event. Australia is responsible for less than 1.6 per cent of the total global warming gases. We really have to realise that there are more urgent things to do in the rest of the world than perhaps in our own country. There are a lot of proposals around for a worldwide reduction in greenhouse gas emissions&mdash;tradeable permits are spoken about and there are many other proposals. Those should be investigated and supported by Australia where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also look very closely at this penchant we have for stopping any form of logging in Australia. This will simply mean that countries which do not have the same sorts of very scientific logging and forest policies as ours and which just slash and burn their forests will have a huge increase in the amount of wood and pulp that they will ship to Australia and elsewhere if Australia stops its forest industry, as is proposed by some of the minor parties. We really have to understand the effect of that when we look at what we do in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have to assist with research into and development of alternative forms of energy. In our policy at the last election, the coalition said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition will target a part of its R&amp;D funding at environmental aspects of energy, production, distribution and use that have an international perspective . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So we are committed to looking at other forms&mdash;things like research into and development of solar and wind power, hydro power and perhaps even uranium. I would be interested to hear from the Greens whether they consider uranium power to be an emitter of greenhouse gas and, if not, why we do not look into that and get a bit more support for that in our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am often amazed that hydro power is one of the cleanest form of power going, yet again we have green, environmental and conservation groups and the very left wing of the Labor Party, the Democrats, stopping major hydro electricity projects that would do away with a lot of the greenhouse gas emissions. That is something I always find very difficult to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, we really have to look at better, more efficient, transport systems, so that Australia still can progress economically but without perhaps the great emissions of greenhouse gases that we presently have. We have to look at things like the Darwin-Alice railway that will enable goods and people to travel in an efficient way. I am reminded that the Labor Party in South Australia spent $850 million on the Myer-Remin building&mdash;one building in Adelaide valued at $850 million. For the cost of that, it could have built the Darwin to Alice railway. The Labor Party really showed where its priorities lay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is at a premium in this debate, but I do just wish to refer at some length to Mr Ian McLachlan's document entitled `Degradation in Australia: a clean Australia'. He quite clearly indicates that the underlying policy objective must be to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an economically viable manner.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The carbon tax which the Labor Party was proposing would, at best, reduce our greenhouse gases by seven million tones over the next five years. However, if we use the methodology of the national greenhouse gas inventory and revegetate 2,000 hectares of native forests and 50,000 hectares of plantation forests in each year, we can absorb approximately three million tonnes of greenhouse gases each year or 15 million tonnes over the five years at a fraction of the cost of a carbon tax and approximately twice as effectively in the absorption of greenhouse gases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr McLachlan, in his very well studied paper which I had intended to quote from more widely if I had had time, has a plan for revegetation of Australia. It is not simply enough to stop clearing land, although this is a fundamental step in the restoration of land quality in this country. Having put an end to excessive land clearing, we have to implement a genuine and effective revegetation program. That is set out in Mr McLachlan's document. We support it in the coalition. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the time that humans have been on earth, there have been considerable local impacts in many areas. We have now got to a situation in which the impact of homo sapiens on the global environment is such that it is impacting everywhere and in a very severe way. In relation to the composition of the atmosphere, because of our burning of fossil fuel and a number of other activities, we are changing the composition of the atmosphere everywhere around the globe faster than at any time during the whole geological period of the existence of the earth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of this lies, I think, in two factors. Firstly, although we have been looking out into space for at least 20 to 25 years to see whether there is other life out there with which we can make contact, we have failed to find any. It would seem as though this little rock in our corner of the universe is the only place that is capable of supporting life. If Einstein's theory of relativity is anywhere near correct, then it remains the only place in which our form of life will ever exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet&mdash;this is the second point&mdash;we are carrying out an experiment on life on this planet the results of which we cannot predict. Nobody knows precisely what effect changing the composition of the atmosphere so rapidly, and changing it to such a different composition, will have. The best scientific advice is that it will indeed lead to global warming, that there will be significant increases in temperatures overall, that there will be significant changes in climate as a consequence, that there will be significant changes in rainfall, that there will be significant changes in sea level and that there will be, therefore, very significant changes in the ability of the natural environment to maintain itself, particularly in national parks and areas that have been set aside to preserve existing wildlife, and also a very significant impact on agriculture around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That we cannot predict exactly what those consequences will be I think raises very much two other principles. The first is the precautionary principle, which says that if you do not know what the consequences of an action are going to be then you are prudent if you proceed as slowly and as cautiously as possible. As this is a global experiment we are carrying out, we should, as a species around the globe everywhere, be cautious in relation to further increases in carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also raises a very significant moral question; that is, the question of intergenerational equity. Is it appropriate that we as the current generation should burn fossil fuel, cut down forests, increase the release of methane from coalmining and a number of other activities, increase the concentration of nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere, again for a whole range of human activities, and leave to our children and later generations the problems of solving those consequences when we do not even know what those consequences might be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the face of all this, I think the response of governments in Australia&mdash;federal, state and local&mdash;to this overwhelming problem has been totally inadequate. In fact, a paper which appeared just last week, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's greenhouse strategy&mdash;Can the future be rescued</EMPHASIS>, by Dr George Wilkenfeld, Dr Clive Hamilton and Dr Hugh Sadler, states that the national greenhouse response strategy has not resulted in a single tonne of greenhouse gas reduction, that most of the measures to which the government points are measures which would have been taken for economic reasons anyway and that there has been not a single specific measure taken with respect to greenhouse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts also said earlier that there had not been a greenhouse conference in Australia. I tell her that in 1988 the Democrats in South Australia ran a greenhouse conference with a number of very eminent speakers and on 15 March in Adelaide at the same venue, at the Institute of Engineers in Adelaide, we will be running another conference. I invite senators, if they want to hear about what can and should be done, to come to that conference. We have, among others, Dr Graham Pearman from the CSIRO, Dr Peter Newman from Murdoch University in Western Australian, Dr David Mills from the University of Sydney, Dr Mark Diesendorf from the Australian National University and Dr Clive Hamilton, whom I have just mentioned, from the Australia Institute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is terribly important, particularly in view of the imminent international meeting in Germany next month, that we really do start putting our house in order. That is why I strongly support the motion of Senator Margetts in relation to the urgent need for a strategy to tackle the problem of greenhouse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, nothing has been done in Australia. We have seen the development of a strategy and we have seen some information made available, but nothing in terms of the actual attack on the problem has occurred in Australia at all. The defect in this lies not only in the environmental consequences, not only in the fact that we are now committed to at least a doubling of carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere and increases in the other greenhouse gases as well, because there is an enormous momentum in this whole process and therefore our children will have to adapt to some sort of change, a change that we cannot predict, but we are at the same time also denying ourselves the opportunity to advance so many of those technologies, technologies which in some cases we have a leading edge on in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned Dr David Mills earlier. Dr David Mills from the University of Sydney has developed specific absorbative surfaces which in many instances make solar thermal derived electricity cheaper than that which comes from coal. Senator Margetts pointed out yesterday or the day before that the electricity grid in New South Wales has been pushed into remote areas to supply coal based electricity when in fact stand-alone solar thermal devices would be cheaper. So there are economic benefits there which the New South Wales government has denied to the people of Australia, by denying the opportunity to support this technology, to make it even cheaper so that we can then export that technology to other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, comes back very much to the feet of the federal government, which is blindly pursuing this Hilmer report, the idea of dividing up to electricity utilities, without at the same time giving primary consideration to the need for energy efficiency. I do not see, necessarily, anything inconsistent between the two, although I would prefer the state utilities to be left as they are and then to have imposed on them energy efficiency, and I would prefer the least cost provision of energy services rather than the provision of electricity. I think that is the pattern that has been followed in the States. However, if the government wants to go down that road it could still impose on those utilities, those end-use suppliers, that they supply not only electricity but also the end-use services which electricity makes available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of domestic solar hot water, only six per cent of houses in Australia have domestic solar hot water services on them. It is far more economical, far more greenhouse friendly and far more creative of employment and industry in Australia to go down the route of providing hot water for people&mdash;that is what they want&mdash;rather than providing electricity through which they then get that hot water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other examples like that. The government has put aside money for the ethanol research program, ethanol from cellulose. As I pointed out in a notice of motion yesterday, not one dollar of that money set aside in the 1993 budget has actually gone into that research. I pointed out in the last week we were here in relation to the $10 million that the government set aside for a solar hot water scheme that not one single domestic hot water system has been put aside as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These things indicate a lack of commitment on the part of government. That is why this motion is terribly important.

Senator Ian Macdonald, I thought in a quite excellent speech, said that perhaps one of the ways of doing things is to go to nuclear power. He then challenged Senator Margetts as to whether or not she agreed with that. There has been no response to that. It may well be that the Greens are interested in nuclear power as a means of cutting down the emissions that we complain about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not what this government will be doing. It considers that there are other things to do rather than using nuclear power because we remember places like Chernobyl and Long Island. Nuclear power is not necessary.

He said minor parties want to stop logging and he said that under the coalition, should it ever come to government, there will be research and development to help these things. The interesting thing he said is that other countries slash and burn in contrast to what this government allows.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all the speeches so far have been a tribute to the work that has been done by Senator Faulkner in this area.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 to add one member to the Authority to represent the interests of Aboriginal people living adjacent to the Park. While research indicates that no Aboriginal people live in the Marine Park, there are thirteen Aboriginal communities located mainly along the northern part of the coast with an estimated population of 6,500 in addition to those residing in towns along the coast. Hunting, fishing and gathering of marine animals for subsistence purposes are major activities in inshore waters adjacent to Aboriginal communities and areas (including towns) where Aboriginal people reside. In the light of the Mabo decision and subsequent legislation dealing with native title, the special provision for this representation on the Authority of aboriginal interests is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes provision for doubling most of the penalties provided under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act, the incorporation of a mental fault element in accordance with the Commonwealth's criminal law policy and a change from indictable offences to summary offences for many of the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Penalties under that act have not been considered generally by the Parliament since 1988. Significant increases in use, demand and competition for resources have occurred since that time. Illegal activities in the Marine Park not only may reap substantial commercial benefits for the participants but also give rise to enormous and possibly irreversible impacts on the Marine Park.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the World Heritage status of the Great Barrier Reef, it is important that Parliament sends a clear message to potential offenders and the courts indicating that it views such environmental offences as very serious. The waste discharge penalties for the owners and controllers of facilities within the Marine Park have been increased from 500 penalty units to 2000. This is in line with other marine pollution legislation which attempts, through the imposition of high penalties, to deter persons from committing offences that might lead to serious impacts, such as those that arose in the case of the Exxon Valdez.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes provision for the preparation of statutory management plans for parts of the Marine Park and species and ecological communities within the Marine Park where such management plans are necessary. Given the dramatic increase in use of the Marine Park in the last ten years, it has now become obvious that the existing permits system is a poor tool for planning purposes, although it will continue to remain an excellent tool for general management purposes. Statutory management plans are therefore necessary to bridge the gap between zoning plans and individual permit decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill increases the powers of Marine Park inspectors to improve the safety and efficiency of enforcement within the Park. The Marine Park covers an area greater than Victoria and Tasmania combined, and is the largest marine protected area in the World. It is most important that the inspectors have adequate powers to enforce the Marine Park Act in areas which may be quite remote. Much of the Park is not covered by mobile phone access and only a small area is covered by good quality seaphone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments give inspectors the power to give reasonable directions to persons within the Marine Park for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the act. It also brings the provisions of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act relating to arrest and search of arrested persons in line with the Commonwealth policy on the exercise of those powers. Changes are also proposed to the regulation making powers to allow for infringement notices to be given for minor offences in the regulations and to remove gender specific language from the Great Barrier Marine Park Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes minor amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 to allow fees, collected under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 for permits, authorities and applications, to be paid into the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Fund. This implements a recommendation that such fees be retained by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service made in the 1992 Review of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment also clarifies and groups together monies that can be paid directly into the  Australian National Parks and Wildlife Fund and monies that must first be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund for appropriation to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments are made to establishing legislation which allows four statutory authorities under the portfolio, namely the Australian Heritage Commission, the Australian Sports Commission, the Australian Sports Drug  Agency and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service the use of credit cards. This is to facilitate administration ease in day-to-day operations so that a good or service may be acquired by the agency using a credit card.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the request of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly, minor amendments have been made in the bill to the Norfolk Island Act 1979 to change the titles of the presiding officers in the Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Sports Commission Act 1985 currently provides for a board comprising a Chairperson, a Deputy Chairperson and up to ten other members. It has always been the Government's intention that these positions be filled by people with experience or expertise in sport&mdash;either as participants or as administrators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent changes to Departmental administrative arrangements will see the Australian Sports Commission taking responsibility for additional sports related activities such as grants to life saving organisations. With reduced involvement of the Department in sport issues and to ensure that adequate links are in place between the Department and the Australian Sports Commission, it is proposed to have the Departmental Secretary hold an ex-officio position on the Commission's board. The proposed amendment to the act will enable that arrangement to be implemented without disrupting the operation of the existing board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact, though some increase in revenue could result from the increased penalties for breaches of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH LEGISLATION (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes to amend the National Health Act 1953, the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will give effect to the government's package of reforms to private health insurance. These reforms focus on consumer rights and provide:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Value for money in private health insurance;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.A wider choice of products achieved by enabling health funds to make contracts with hospitals and doctors; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The reforms also provide for efficiency measures and equitable access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare is the centre piece of the government's health policy and enjoys strong community support. The latest market survey shows that over 87 per cent of the population support the Medicare program. Medicare provides an accessible, high quality public health system for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Private health insurance offers a choice for those who want it, but it needs to be seen for what it is&mdash;a supplement to the public health system. However, those persons who choose this product are entitled to high quality and good value in the same way as buyers of any other product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I think it's fair to say consumers aren't getting that now and that is why participation rates for private health insurance are continuing to decline, with consumers suffering ever-increasing premiums and high and unanticipated costs when they use the private system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms will place the health insurance industry in a position to achieve efficiency gains and pass on the benefit of those gains to their members in the form of lower premiums and better controlled costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I will now outline the main elements of the reform package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Health funds have traditionally been seen simply as `bill payers'. These reforms will encourage them to be purchasers of health services and representatives of their members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the arrangements proposed by this bill, from 1 April 1995, funds may enter into hospital purchaser-provider agreements with hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary aims of requiring contracts between funds and hospitals are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to generate competition between health funds and hospitals, resulting in improved efficiency leading to better value-for-money, quality and access for patients;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to link hospital funding to appropriate quality assurance and accreditation procedures; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to reduce restrictions on products offered, thereby allowing funds to operate according to market demand for different products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also attaches conditions to any such contract with hospitals requiring them to submit a single account covering all service and facility components and provide data for modelling, evaluation and research purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first instance, contracts between funds and hospitals can be on the current basis of per diem payments, including the structure of basic and supplementary tables or on a casemix payment basis. The current basic table of insurance will continue to be available up to 1 July 1997 to hospitals which enter into a contract. On 1 July 1997, the basic and supplementary tables will cease and contracts will be structured on the basis of a casemix payment system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a national commitment to replace the current private health insurance per diem payment system with casemix payments. Casemix is the most significant commonwealth health financing initiative developed in australia. It sometimes sounds arcane and technical&mdash;but basically it is a simple idea which enables the measurement of what happens in hospitals i.e. The episodes of care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The term `casemix' means the types or mix of patients which a hospital treats, but can refer to any scientific approach to the classification of patient care episodes and ideas on how to use those classifications to help make decisions about health care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implementation of casemix payments will improve efficiency within hospitals and improve the quality and quantity of the information available on what takes place in hospitals, and hence improve quality and outcome of health care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commonwealth developed system&mdash;Australian national diagnosis related groups&mdash;would normally be used for acute in-hospital care under casemix payments. Other payment mechanisms&mdash;for example, per diem payments&mdash;would need to continue for longer term/non-acute patients, such as chronic psychiatric patients and nursing home type patients, until more precise episodic classification becomes viable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where hospitals and funds do not enter a contract arrangement, there will be a transition period during which the fund would be required to provide a benefit payment at a level determined by the fund. This will be an incentive for hospitals to enter into contracts, while providing protection for patients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, there have been suggestions that these provisions give too much power to the funds and that they may misuse this power in an anti-competitive way, say to advantage hospitals that they may own. The government is satisfied that the trade practices act provides protection against anti-competitive action by any funds&mdash;and, in any case, the number of health fund owned hospitals, only about 6 per cent of private hospital beds, makes such anti-competitive action unlikely to be attractive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funds will be encouraged to contract with high quality, cost efficient hospitals. A fund with a large market share may be able to negotiate a lower price, and this is what competition is all about. However, the exercise of their market power must be consistent with the trade practices act which prohibits the use of such power to reduce competition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result of the introduction of this new approach is that consumers will be able to choose packages with lower premiums if they are happy to use the hospitals and doctors contracted by their fund. They will also be able to choose packages that cover them for the total cost of hospital treatment, eliminating the gap that often exists at the moment between the amount of the bill and the level of their benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is likely that most funds will cover most hospitals, there will be a range of products that vary according to the range of services and number of hospitals covered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, a product might cover all hospitals, or most of the major public and private hospitals, or a few small private hospitals according to the level of access consumers wish to have.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, consumers could choose between full coverage, an agreed level of co-payment for lower premiums or products with known out-of-pocket payments similar to the current front end deductible arrangements.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consumers will be able to purchase a product that best suits their need, at a price that best suits their budget. There will be more choice&mdash;not less&mdash;and for the first time, consumers will have information and power to exercise those choices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funds and hospitals will implement arrangements to avoid insured consumers unknowingly being admitted to hospitals not specifically covered by their health insurance product, and doctors will also need to play a role in referring patients to hospitals covered by the patient's health insurance product. However, for cases such as emergency admissions to non-contracted hospitals, funds will be obliged to make a payment based on average payments to contracted hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill requires health funds to offer a product which covers the full range of treatments and services in hospitals. Mr President, this will ensure that people with high health needs have access to appropriate private insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second part of paragraph 29 of schedule 1 to the bill will enable funds and doctors to enter into contracts for the provision of medical services rendered in hospital. The contract may exclude out-of-pocket costs or allow for a predetermined amount to be borne by the patient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this reform addresses one of the greatest concerns of private health fund members. Unlike the current arrangements, patients will know in advance of admission to hospital what medical expenses, if any, they will have to meet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, contracted doctors will not be permitted to raise bills outside of the contract but these contracts will not be compulsory and contract payments may be made on whatever basis funds and doctors choose. For example, a percentage of the MBS fee, a retainer or some other agreed payment. Members may purchase this type of coverage for contracted doctors on an add on basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly therefore, this is not introducing an American style managed care system. Doctors will still be able to receive fee for service and the structure of our private hospital system will not change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this legislation does not introduce `open-ended' gap insurance either. Although funds may negotiate whatever fees they wish with a doctor, if their contracts are too generous, higher premiums would result. Since higher premiums will lead to a decrease in market share, there is a strong incentive for funds to negotiate reasonable contract prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph 69 of schedule 1 of the bill provides for an amendment to the Health Insurance Act 1973 to enable the 75 per cent Medicare benefit to be paid direct to the health fund for services rendered by contracted doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In-hospital services rendered by doctors who do not enter into a contract with a fund will continue to attract overall payments equal to 100 per cent of the MBS fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, may I repeat, the focus of this legislation is on strengthening consumer rights and on making private health insurance better value for money.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the establishment of an independent complaints commissioner from 1 July 1995. The establishment of the commissioner will provide insured persons with access to an effective complaints handling mechanism which can investigate, conciliate and make recommendations in response to complaints about private health insurance products. A 008 telephone network will be put in place to provide insured persons with easy access to the commissioner no matter where they live.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the tasks of the commissioner will be to provide input to a private patient charter which will be designed to assist consumers in obtaining specific information from funds, doctors, hospitals, my department and the complaints unit itself. The charter will also encourage doctors to inform patients of an estimate of their fees and of the fees of other doctors involved in a prospective episode of treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A separate bill, titled the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994, provides for health funds to pay a levy to finance the administration expenses of the complaints commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph 70 of schedule 2 to the bill provides the Private Health Insurance Administration Council with the additional function of publishing information in relation to health funds' premiums, benefits and products to assist persons in making an informed choice about the product which best suits their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the final group of amendments are to improve the operation of some elements of the current environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraphs 12 to 23 of schedule 2 of the bill remove the requirement for open membership organisations to conduct a separate health fund in each state. This measure will increase administrative efficiency and allow organisations to react quickly to changing circumstances. It will also reduce competitive differences between open and restricted membership organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 67 of the National Health Act 1953 requires organisations conducting health insurance business to be registered under the act and operate in conformity with community rating. This provision was introduced from 1 September 1985 in response to the growth in health insurance by general insurers which, by imposing restrictions on certain benefits and on age, had the capacity to offer lower premiums and hence attract the young and healthy members away from registered insurers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsequently, there has been an increase in the incidence of health plans being operated in respect of employee groups. These plans are not caught by the national health act because either no underwriting of the liability or premiums are involved or such plans are conducted under a discretionary trust deed arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government remains committed to the principle of community rating. Paragraphs 9 to 11 of schedule 2 of the bill propose amendments to section 67 of the act which will require employers conducting such plans to register them under the act or cease to conduct the plans with effect from 1 July 1995. This will bring such plans into line with registered funds and, for example, require them to participate in the reinsurance arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments would not prevent employers continuing to meet employees' premiums to a registered health fund. Paragraph 10 of schedule 2 of the bill contains a ministerial power to exempt certain schemes, for example where an employer meets health expenses not covered by employees who maintain appropriate registered health insurance cover.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, funds are required to notify the secretary within 7 days after they change their rules, constitution or articles and such changes may be disallowed on a retrospective basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a means to further safeguard community rating, paragraph 43 of schedule 1 of the bill provides for changes to be notified prospectively. Advice about changes in premiums will need to be provided 7 days before the day on which they are to apply while other changes to rules will need to be notified 60 days before the effective date. However, a ministerial discretion will be available to accept notifications for lesser period where the changes provide for the introduction of new products in response to consumer demands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity has also been taken under paragraph 61 of schedule 1 of the bill to modify the pre-existing ailment rule to reduce administrative difficulties for funds. This change is not expected to have any significant impact on members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the decline in participation rates for private health insurance has attracted cries from the opposition parties, the AMA and industry groups for the government to subsidise the cost of private insurance by way of tax rebates. Persons on low incomes, such as pensioners, would gain no benefit from tax subsidies. Furthermore, such proposals ignore the fact that Medicare already provides funding for private patients. Any additional subsidy large enough to increase private insurance participation would cost more than treating the newly insured in the public system. Or, put another way, the massive budget cuts to public hospitals required to fund tax rebates, would have a far greater impact than any increase in demand from former fund members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, will place the health insurance industry in a position to work with hospitals, doctors and contributors to ensure the future of efficient and affordable private health insurance packages that offer both protection and value for money for consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPLAINTS LEVY BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for a levy to be imposed on health insurance businesses of registered health funds to finance the administration expenses of the complaints commission. It is proposed that the rate of the levy, which will be prescribed by regulations, will be a maximum of 25 cents per quarter for single contributors and 50 cents per quarter for family contributors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levy is not expected to exceed about 6 cents single and 12 cents family per quarter during the first year.</PARA>

It does not say that we will finish at 10.30 p.m.; it says `or whichever is the later' when we finish the debate on the bill. So that means 10.30 p.m. or when the debate on the bill is finished.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is totally unacceptable that some sort of discussion across the table between Senator Ray and Senator Hill has been interpreted as the government having informed the opposition. Senator Hill said that we would look at the proposition when the government put it forward. He was not anticipating its being brought in at 5.30.

It is totally inappropriate, given that the standing orders clearly define the time that the Senate should finish. It is only right and proper that the staff around this place should expect&mdash;except at the end of a session, when we all know that we will sit late&mdash;at least 24 hours notice of a requirement to stay here until perhaps 2 or 3 in the morning.

<PARA>The reason that I move this motion for a referral to the Community Affairs References Committee is that this legislation represents the most fundamental change since I graduated in medicine 38 years ago. It alters the system&mdash;in fact, it goes beyond that&mdash;because right from the development of modern medicine, which goes back 5,000 years, the basis of medical practice has been that a patient goes to a doctor and then the doctor becomes the patient's advocate and represents that patient in that history of illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this legislation does is introduce contracts between doctors and insurance companies, so doctors no longer become the patients' advocate&mdash;they are contracted to insurance companies, and, to quote those memorable words on television, `there's even more'. The hospitals are contracted to insurance companies as well. But there is even more&mdash;some major insurance companies own the hospitals as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very fundamental change in the whole structure of health care. For example, Senator Burns would not be able to come as a patient to me as a doctor. Normally, it would be my responsibility as the doctor to look after Senator Burns as the patient, but my responsibility would be to whatever health insurance fund he happened to be with, if he were with one, and not with the patient. I would be responsible to the insurance com</PARA>
<PARA>pany. I can draw an analogy with a house burning down, as happened to me once. My house burned down. I went to my insurance company and asked how much it would pay me for the episode. It said that it would give me a third of what I had the place insured for because it was 60 years old and under the system it had depreciated by one per cent per annum. It is no longer the responsibility of the doctor to look after the patient. It is the responsibility of the insurance company to look after people. I would not put my trust in an insurance company in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go into what has occurred in relation to this legislation. It has been referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, which is a one-day committee. We sought submissions. In fact, we have 67 submissions in all to date, and I have them with me. Who was consulted before this legislation was drawn up? Have one guess&mdash;the Australian Health Insurance Association. Were the private hospitals consulted? Not at all, even though they represent over 300 hospitals in this country. Were the public hospitals consulted, or the Australian Hospitals Association, which represents the rest of them, over 600 hundred hospitals? Not at all. The whole hospital industry was not consulted, and that is borne out by their submissions. Were the patients consulted? Like everything in health care, the last people who were considered were the patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking through this list of submissions I will read out what the submissions have said in relation to this: the National Community Advisory Group on Mental Health&mdash;against the legislation; a consumer,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nicholas Tonti-Phillipini&mdash;against the legislation; the Council on the Ageing&mdash;against the legislation. In reading the 67 submissions, the only one I can find that is for the legislation is the Consumers Health Forum&mdash;a government front. Another consumer association, the Mental Health Advisory Group of the Northern Territory&mdash;against the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have dealt with the hospitals. I have dealt with what submissions we have from the consumers. There are other consumers, of course, but they are not organised to that degree. What about the doctors? There is the Council of Procedural Specialists, the AMA, the Australian Association of Surgeons. None of them was consulted on the most fundamental change proposed in health care in this country in my lifetime. There was no consultation whatsoever. Do you think anybody outside this arena is aware of it? Are the patients and the individuals aware that this is going on? They do not have the faintest idea because there has been no debate. Is the media aware of it? They do not have a clue because it has to be spoon-fed to them to get them to understand it. They do not understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider what is proposed. The proposal is that it go off to a one-day legislation committee. What chance do these 67 submissions have in one day? We are talking about extending the time of sitting today for a few hours so that we can consider the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill that has been introduced, but for fundamental changes to the health care system of this country you are proposing that it be done in a day so that it can be considered. The Australian Health Insurance Association, which originally represented all the private insurance associations, has split apart. The Medical Benefits Fund of Australia&mdash;which is the largest privately operated health fund in Australia, representing 1.4 million consumers, and I have its submission here&mdash;is against the legislation and has split from the AHIA. The Hospital Contribution Fund, which is also one the largest funds, has reservations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister says that health insurance will be cheaper. It is not her intent to raise the numbers that are insured. She says that that is not her prerogative; it is against ALP policy to provide any sort of subsidy for health insurance. She says that it will make health insurance cheaper. On what basis does she say that? As I mentioned to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, the only advocate was Russell Schneider, who is the executive director of the Australian Health Insurance Association. In a speech he gave to an Australian Private Hospitals Association meeting in October-November last year, he said that it will slow the decline of health insurance but he will not guarantee that premiums will not rise. On what basis does the minister say that it will make health insurance cheaper? She has no basis because not in any of these 67 submissions is that said to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that Senator Richardson&mdash;of some notoriety, perhaps&mdash;said that, in relation to health care, you had to have 40 per cent of the population privately insured to sustain the basis of the public hospitals, because if people need health care and they are not insured, they either self-insure or they go onto the public hospital waiting lists. He said that 40 per cent had to be privately insured. The latest figures show that it is as low as just over 34 per cent. It was 36.6 per cent at the last available figures. In our state of Queensland, Mr Acting Deputy President, it is down to 30 per cent. It is in free fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we get? We get this situation where this legislation is being introduced without consultation and without people even knowing. In estimates committee hearings last Thursday week I questioned the department and Senator Crowley, who was representing the minister. They did not know  what the result of it was. It was a giant experiment&mdash;that is what we were led to believe&mdash;`We are going to try this experiment on the Australian public. We have no idea what the outcome is going to be.' If I could draw an analogy, what will occur in this situation with free fall is that it will be like closing all the private schools in Australia and sending those children to the public school system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a crisis. Everybody acknowledges it. The front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> yesterday was devoted to the crisis in health care in Queensland. There is overcrowding of our public hospitals. There are waiting lists that are extending out. I have mentioned previously in this chamber that there are waiting lists that extend to four years in some specialties. I see in the latest report commissioned by the government into waiting lists that it is unable to tell us what the waiting lists in Queensland were. The minister for health there said that it was because they do not have the computer equipment or the structure in Queensland to even find out what the waiting lists are. So we still do not have a true estimate of what the waiting lists are in Queensland and in other states. But we do not have to; we just have to ask some of the people who are on those waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Prince Charles Hospital in Queensland we have records of where people have died while they were on waiting lists there. That is documented. There is under-utilisation of the private hospitals. To a large degree all of this is due to the rapid ageing of the population and to the rapid increase and use of modern technology. This is reflected in the rapid increase in the utilisation of diagnostic facilities, particularly in relation to radiology and also in relation to pathology and the other modalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with the provisions in this motion one at a time. The first is to discuss the current ability of privately insured persons to choose their medical service providers. I have had correspondence with Mr Schneider on this very matter. At present there is unlimited choice. Any one of us can go to a general practitioner of our choice or, in turn, to a specialist of our choice without restraint. We may be constrained by our ability to pay for that particular medical service provider, but we always have the opportunity of going to a bulk-billing clinic in the case of a general practice or to a public hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes in this legislation will limit choice. Whichever way you look at it, it will limit choice. The specialist in this case, in relation to a private hospital, will need to be contracted to that hospital and then, in turn, that specialist is contracted to the insurance company. So whichever way you look at it, you cannot say that there will be more choice. There will be a limitation of choice as it exists today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point in the motion is in relation to the quality of care provided to medical service users. Does anybody really think that when the health system is controlled by the insurance companies the quality will improve and there will be a decrease in price? It defies logic. It defies all the experience that any of us have had in relation to any action regarding the consumption of materials. The quality will inevitably decline because it will be quicker and sicker through the hospital system, as the AMA said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point relates to the level of private health insurance coverage. To an extent, I have done that already. The fourth point relates to the operation of the private hospital system and the medical profession, particularly in relation to the principles of the Trade Practices Act. That relates to the fact that, in effect, you are introducing a collusive bargaining process which will disadvantage an individual patient. The final point relates to the cost of private health insurance. Neither the Australian Health Insurance Association nor any of the other organisations&mdash;the Council of Procedural Specialists, the AMA, the AAS, the RACGP, all the providers&mdash;believe that it will get the cost of health insurance down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are going to introduce something, you normally need a model. Where have preferred provider organisations been developed in the world? In the United States of America. I almost laugh at this because when I entered this chamber nearly five years ago Senator Tate was representing the minister for health in this chamber. One day I interjected across the chamber that the standard of health care in the USA was the best in the world, provided you could afford it. That was thrown back in my face time after time by Senator Loosley and by Senator Tate&mdash;mocking me for what I said about the standard of health care in the USA and saying that that was what the opposition was going to introduce into this country. We were not at all, as you well know. Never at any time was that suggested, but it was again part of that campaign of denigration, obfuscation and&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I knew that, Senator Sherry. It was that big three letter word beginning with `l' and ending with `e'.

Look forward, Australia, at what has happened in the big old US of A&mdash;rocketing health costs and collusive bargaining. I just read a book about it, as a matter of fact, and it was quite fascinating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always interesting when governments try to control things; they always get it wrong. The ALP has had 12 years to tinker with the health system of this country. I ask those opposite to trot out anybody in Australia who will tell me that the health system has improved in the last 12 years, that there is better access, that people are being treated much more expeditiously, that the quality of care has improved. Three years ago I asked the secretary to the department where in his report the word `quality' was used. I can tell you it did not appear. It was fascinating that it appeared the following year, though. The word suddenly jumped out of the box and got into the report. But there we are. This legislation is designed to bring the American preferred provider system into this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be obvious to all that there needs to be considered debate on this legislation. If we are genuine in trying to improve and patch up the Medicare model&mdash;because we in the opposition believe that it should be continued, that there are many benefits produced by a universal health insurance system&mdash;surely it must be obvious to all of us that there needs to be more consideration than a quick legislation committee consideration. I do not believe that we are going to get anywhere unless we spend time with this. I know that Senator Lees and the Democrats believed that initially and I am not sure where they stand on this matter at the moment, but surely Senator Lees will agree with me that these 67 submissions&mdash;I am happy to go through them one at a time, but time probably constrains me&mdash;reveal almost universal condemnation of these measures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with two things Senator Herron said. Firstly, and most importantly, this is a fundamental change to the way the private health sector will operate in this country. The basic detail in this legislation is certainly controversial. It has attracted some 67 submissions. The second thing I would like to agree with is the comment about lack of consultation. It is not up to me to talk about why that occurred. I leave it to some later speakers from the other side to explain why there has been so little consultation. There was, I understand, a couple of, how shall we say, appointments kept, but discussion and consultation to me is a two-way process. It was not consultation. There may have been a meeting but there is no result shown in the legislation, no indication that people were actually listened to when they had those appointments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Herron that these submissions are highly critical&mdash;bar one. However, what we are looking at now is a committee process from which will come a substantial number of amendments and even the department, although we will not get down to specific details until after the committee hearing, has agreed that amendments are certainly going to be needed in a large number of areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Something about which I cannot agree with Senator Herron is that we are simply introducing the American model. We are not, because we have Medicare backing up and underlying our health system here in this country. This legislation is about trying to put some sort of a ceiling over or floor under the private sector so that we can look at some cost containment. People are getting out of private health insurance, firstly, because the premiums are increasing and increasing and, secondly, because they are being left with bigger and bigger gap payments, many of which they knew absolutely nothing about before they went into hospital. I do not believe there is any excuse for elective procedures. Doctors should be obliged to inform patients of the full costs up front. I know many doctors are doing that but, unfortunately, it is still far too few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator Herron to suggest as he did in his speech that all the submissions are against the fundamental proposal is simply wrong. If you read through the submissions, you will see that they are clustered into different groups concerned about different parts of the legislation. The majority of submissions are from small hospitals, private hospitals, but not all; some of the public ones are also just as concerned about this. An amendment which most of them agreed would sort out a fundamental problem is the substantial default payment. In other words, if a particular hospital is not contracted with that insurance company, people insured with that company using that hospital will still be able to get a substantial part of their costs refunded. That is one of the amendments that the Democrats will be moving. The exact level of that default will depend on what we hear during the committee hearings on Friday and Monday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must add that, if we do not have sufficient time, then our committee can simply ask for an extension of time. There is nothing to prevent the legislative committee from asking for more time if we find that the witnesses on Friday or on Monday are not able to get through all their concerns. Indeed if the committee, having selected its witnesses based on the cluster of issues that each is concerned about, wants additional witnesses to talk about specific issues, it can arrange further hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Herron also made the comment that the media is not aware of the legislation. I would question that. I think there are certainly some journalists who are following this quite closely. Liz Jurman and Amanda Meade of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> are just two of them. They understand the legislation. My concern as far as the media goes is the quite misleading advertisement by the procedural specialists. There are grains of truth and genuine concerns in the advertisement. However, the half a dozen letters I have received as a result of that ad are about the gap payments with which people have been faced in the past. Surely it is the procedural specialists themselves to whom these people should be talking about some of those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Before I deal in detail with the motion before us, I would like to look at the legislation and some of the key issues raised in the submissions. I will go through some of the major ones. I have already mentioned the default payment which is probably the key issue for 60 or 70 per cent. It is mentioned in submissions from the AMA, the hospitals and the consumer groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other major concerns is the possibility under this legislation for the insurance companies to opt out of psychiatric and rehabilitation services. They will find it more attractive to offer packages that do not have any psychiatric or rehab cover. Indeed, one insurance company is already doing that. Of particular concern is that this company is targeting young people and convincing them they do not need any psychiatric cover, because it can offer them much cheaper premiums. Looking at the statistics, we find that something like one in five of us are, at some time in our lives, going to need some support in the psychiatric health area and it is of great concern that this legislation could allow insurers to disadvantage people in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to note the fact that, despite comments by the government last year about full financial disclosure and aggregate billing, they are not covered in this bill to any great extent. These are among the other issues raised in a number of the submissions. Another is the question of privacy which comes up from two different angles. As far as the Trade Practices Act is concerned, it is the question of applicability to this legislation that is the cause for concern. That is why the committee has chosen to request that the trade practices people come before it and give their version of whether or not they will be interested in this legislation and whether they will be able to deal with the complaints resulting from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The start-up date has been contentious from the start and it is one issue that is certainly up for amendment. We will look at a far more reasonable time frame, particularly for the smaller hospitals, to enable them to come to grips with these particular changes. We need to look at patients' rights and also the ability of doctors to negotiate as groups rather than as individuals. They are some of the major concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the legislation committee is capable of dealing with  this legislation. This committee has dealt with quite a number of very complex pieces of legislation. It has been able to get through, before today, the committee process in a room upstairs and has been able to do it successfully. I suggest that Senator Herron's moving this motion today as opposed to after the committee has been through its processes, indicates that he is really saying that the committee is not capable of getting it right this time. Perhaps what we need to do is go through the debate in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should give the committee the chance to proceed. What we will come out with after the meetings on Friday and Monday and the discussions this week is quite a different piece of legislation. If we get to next Thursday and it is not possible for us to reach any sort of agreement and we are still looking at a piece of legislation that very few people support then we can revisit the whole issue of where we go from there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now look at the motion before us. The first section deals with exactly what the submissions before us deal with&mdash;the hospital purchaser-provider arrangements and medical purchaser-provider arrangements within the private health insurance system. That is what I believe we will be able to deal with as we proceed through the legislative committee. We will be able to ask questions of the key witnesses. We have called witnesses from both sides of the fence&mdash;those who seem quite happy with the amendments and those, like the procedural specialists, who are going to remain implacably opposed to it no matter what we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next part of the motion deals with the current ability of privately insured persons to choose their medical service providers. What we really should be doing if we want this as a term of reference at some later date is looking at the effect of the legislation as amended not as it is at the moment. I agree with Senator Herron that, as it is at the moment, there are some major questions. If we still have major concerns in the future that may be something we need to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the quality of care provided to medical service users, I am sure we will find that Australia has amongst the best standards of care in the world. Perhaps we should be looking more at some of the questions raised about the possible changes after this legislation is passed. As for the level of health insurance, there are statistics on that which come out regularly. The Trade Practices Act questions can be dealt with when those people are before us on Monday. As for the cost of private health insurance, basically everyone is arguing that it is too high. That is something else that can be dealt with once we have seen the effect of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we put this question to the committee perhaps we should also put the question of looking at the costs of private health. Perhaps we should also look at specialist fees and charges, hospital charges and the increases in hospital fees. The private hospitals that I have visited in my home state in the last few weeks have told me that they have not had increases from the insurance companies to even keep up with inflation. There is very little room for us to find any cost blow-outs. There have to be reasons for this somewhere in the system. If we do need to look at this further down the track then I would certainly like to have the time to debate these terms of reference in more detail and look at extending them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is something that should be looked at in the future. Perhaps the most important thing to consider if we want a reference for this committee at the moment is a monitoring process for casemix. I would like to see that not just in the public sector but in the private sector as well. I would like to look at what is really happening. Are we right in saying that we are seeing, at least in two states, a reduction in care given to some sections within the community, including people with disabilities and older people? Are we seeing a lack of services that were supposed to go with casemix, in particular the community and home support services for those that are moving out of hospitals earlier?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want a useful reference for this committee, I would ask that we pass this legislation and then set up a decent monitoring process, which I must say is in the AMA's submission. We should then look at monitoring casemix in both the public and the private sectors and not continue the constant buck passing between the states and the federal government that is occurring at the moment. The federal government is saying, `We have given you the money,' and the state governments are saying, `No you have not. We are going to have to cut even further.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are at least two states that are now taking the money out faster than the extra money is going in. They are simply putting it into black holes rather than using the money freed up by casemix to actually improve the health services in those states. I cannot see why we have to deal with this matter today. It is something that we can come back to a few months hence once the amended bill is through this place. We can then look at what is happening in both the public and private health sectors. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the chairperson of the legislative side of the committee, I am absolutely offended to the nth degree that this matter is being debated today. This motion was moved yesterday without any discussion in the committee. The legislative part of the committee was having discussions about how we were going to deal with this bill when it came to us. We even chose to start the process of hearings and submission collection and gathering earlier than normal and, in fact, prior to the legislation leaving the House of Representatives because we knew that there was interest in this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened? Yesterday we were supposed to be having a meeting about this matter in the opposition senator's area outside. We were waiting for a quorum. We could not get a quorum for the simple reason that the chair of the references part of the community affairs committee was in here giving notice of this motion relating to the issue that the legislation committee was trying to get a quorum for to debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Go and read the new standing orders. You have not read those. I think that is the most disgusting and despicable thing that has happened to a senator who has had the opportunity of chairing a committee in this place. You did not even have the decency to warn the committee or discuss with the committee that this was going to happen. Then we see the matter in here as business of the Senate. How can it be business of the Senate when the committee did not even have the chance to discuss the issue. I find it so annoying and so disgusting that it nearly leaves me speechless except that it is such an important issue. We have heard a lot of diatribe tonight that the issue has been sprung on us and that there has been no consultation. Honestly, where have people been living for the last two years&mdash;under stones?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When former Senator Richardson was a minister, he raised the issue of the declining number of people taking out private health insurance. We then had a discussion paper that arose out of his concerns. That was released in December 1993, which is nearly 15 months ago. For anyone in the industry to have the gall to say that they did not know anything was happening is just beyond belief. </PARA>

We have also had the ACTU caucus working party group, which some opposition senators do not like very much. However, we do at least discuss things with groups. There has also been an IDC on the issue, but the opposition chooses not to take much notice of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this is an important issue. Medicare is something that the people in this country view as a very important cornerstone of their health care, and it is very good. People keep saying that with Medicare they know what it is going to cost them. They use their Medicare card and they are covered. But if they choose to go to a private hospital or to be treated as a private patient, they do not know what it is going to cost them. The bills, which are from people they have never seen and for services they did not even know they had to have or had been given, keep coming in. This is the critical complaint that I keep getting from people who have the top cover of health insurance. My next-door neighbour had a cataract operation. She was $6,000 out of pocket. These are the sorts of reasons why people are opting out of private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will give those people who opt to have private health treatment a similar sort of safety net. They will know what it is going to cost. But I suppose there are people with vested interests out there who will not want the general public to know that they are charging 50 per cent or 150 per cent over and above the common schedule fee. That is probably the issue that is causing the most annoyance to and the most noise from organisations such as COPS, the Council of Procedural Specialists. We are hearing a lot of hip-pocket nerves squealing on its part because it does not want to have to justify to anybody how much it is charging its patients and why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is about making sure that people understand how much their private hospital cover, their private hospitalisation and their medical and allied services are going to cost them. That is the basis of this bill. It is about providing some cover and some safety net for people who choose to have their own health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear that people should take out private health insurance and have a choice. A lot of people have a choice, and they choose to self-insure. But nowhere from the opposition or the Democrats have I heard any comments about what they think about people who self-insure. It appears to me that the opposition does not think people should self-insure. A lot of people who have sufficient income can make that decision and that choice, but those opposite would not want them to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the number of people with private health insurance has dropped. It was very good of Senator Herron to provide us with the status of the number of people with private health insurance. But what he did not tell us was: has the occupancy rate in private hospitals decreased? Has the number of bed days decreased? I suggest that he read the submission from the Australian Health Insurance Association, which is headed by Mr Russell Schneider. The submission contains some very fascinating statistics which indicate that the level of use of private hospitals has not declined. It is very important that people be aware of the fact that people may be opting out of self-insurance but they are still opting to have private health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue I wish to raise&mdash;I presume those opposite do not want to hear about this&mdash;relates to the complaints mechanism provided in this bill. People who have complaints and problems with their health insurance or their private treatment will have a mechanism by which they can voice their complaints. Their complaints can be resolved by an independent person. Isn't it strange that people would not want that? If you have private health insurance with Medibank Private and you have a complaint, you have the right to have that complaint heard by the ombudsman. Why shouldn't all of the other private health insurance funds be subject to the same criteria, the same assessment and the same regulation as Medibank Private? Medibank Private in its submission had no problems with this. I am very concerned about people who do not want to see the introduction of complaints mechanisms and who talk about caring for the consumer. Those opposite want to delay this bill and do everything they can to prevent it from being passed. They do not care whether the consumer has a complaints mechanism. These are the sorts of double standards with which we are being faced today. It is despicable that this is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also read in the submissions how important choice is and that you must have the right to the doctor of your choice and to be referred to the specialist of your choice. I would suggest that most people out there today who are referred to specialists would not have much of an idea as to whom they were being referred. The average person is not in a position to make a choice about whom they will be referred to. Mind you, because people in rural areas cannot get doctors to come out to them, they do not have any choice. They have to go and see that one because that one is probably the only one in the town. But that is another issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who are referred by their general practitioner to other health professionals really do not know who they are being referred to. They may have some idea of the reputation of the person, but they have no idea of the person's professional capacity. They have to trust their GP. The GP chooses whom the patient is referred to, not the patient. It is held up as being sacrosanct that the patient must have their own choice of specialist. I would suggest to you that if the majority of people in this place, with the exception of half a dozen people here in this room, required referral to a medical speciality, they would not be able to choose whom they wanted because they would not be in a position to make that decision. Senator Patterson, Senator Herron and Senator Woods are in a position to choose, but the majority of people in this place do not have the same medical knowledge and paramedical knowledge that they do. Therefore, they are not in a position to make the same choice. The argument that people must have a choice, which keeps being trotted out, is the greatest load of rubbish. It is absolutely useless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing we kept hearing in those submissions that Senator Herron talked about was that some of the organisations want the collection of data to be done by an independent organisation. If it is done by an independent organisation, it then ceases to have the protection of the Commonwealth and therefore the protection of the Privacy Act. It would appear from some of the submissions that it would be a commercial venture. Wouldn't that be absolutely wonderful? It would mean that your name would be on another mailing list. Some of the drug companies that might be interested in flogging their new product might be able to ring up this independent organisation and purchase the mailing list of everybody who is being treated for a gastric ulcer or rheumatoid arthritis or something like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How much protection would you be giving people? You would not be giving them any because, firstly, it is a commercial venture and therefore the lists can be flogged&mdash;there is no other way to put it&mdash;and, secondly, it is not under the Commonwealth umbrella and therefore it is not under the Privacy Act. This legislation that we are about to bring in would be under the Privacy Act and therefore it would have the protection of the Privacy Commissioner. That is a very important point for people to be very conscious and aware of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an issue that is of great importance. As I said earlier, I feel offended that the opposition should think that the legislation committee is not capable of dealing with it. We are capable of dealing with this. We are in fact in the throes of dealing with this. I am not sure, in terms of the standing orders&mdash;and this is probably something that the Clerk is going to have to ponder over&mdash;just where we go when we have this sort of stunt being pulled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next week we will put in a report of our committee's deliberations. What will happen? Will it come into here? Because there is a reference inquiry going on, will we be able to deal with it? Or does it mean that, as a government, we will come in here and have everybody else ganging up on us because they decide they want to stall for a bit more time? This is the sort of disgusting thing that undermines the good government of this country and the running of this House. I think that is something that people have to be very conscious of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought this whole issue was one that we would be able to work out, discuss and negotiate. Certainly, I thought we would be made aware that amendments were being circulated.  Whether we as the government liked them or not&mdash;maybe there were some that we would have to accept&mdash;is another matter. But in this situation, we were not even made aware of this. We are being ambushed at the pass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that some opposition senators will follow me and say that I have done my usual doctor bash. So be it. As a nurse, I suppose that is something my profession gets into fairly regularly. I suppose it is a healthy inter-professional rivalry. They will also plead the case of the procedural specialists in the AMA. They will probably plead the case of some of the private hospitals, too. I think that is sectional interest, and it is not being concerned with what is good for the patient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you think that everybody should be able to afford private health insurance, I suggest you read the submission from the Council on the Aging. This very good submission points out the economic breakdown of people who should be encouraged into private health insurance. That is very important. But for the bulk of people, particularly the aged, Medicare is the best thing. If we do not address this issue&mdash;and it seems to me that the opposition's proposal is nothing more than just a stunt to prevaricate a bit longer&mdash;then we are going to undermine what we have got. We need to look only at the opposition's policy the last time it went to the polls. It was going to help low income people get health insurance. But it was still not prepared to deal with this issue of people finally being left with bills for services under health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five or six items are listed for discussion. These all go to the nub of the bill. I do not think I can repeat enough that people should think carefully about the fact that two days for hearings have already been provided&mdash;Friday and Monday morning of next week. I hope we can finish by then, but the indications are that we will continue for longer. This is already being dealt with. I do not know why we need to deal with it again. It seems to me that it is defeating the whole purpose. It is adding to the workload of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reporting date is 27 March. There is only one up week between now and 27 March. Do senators really think that they are going to spend that whole up week tramping around the countryside or having hearings with people who are concerned with this issue? What will happen to the work that the committee secretariat has already done? It is a separate section and a separate committee. Therefore, all of it will have to be duplicated if those submissions are going to go from one committee to the other. All of this sort of stuff has to be taken into consideration. I think this is typical of the absolute sham the opposition is starting to perpetuate in the way it is handling and treating committees. I am deadly opposed to what Senator Herron has moved. </PARA>

Nevertheless, two days of hearings have been arranged and 67 submissions have been received. Senator Lees has already said that the legislative committee is capable of recognising when more time is needed and providing that additional time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this legislation were not before a committee already, it might be a different matter. Maybe Senator Herron feels that practitioners need the opportunity to express their views. In that case, they should be encouraged to present their views in the context that this matter is already being considered. In my view, it would be most undesirable to undermine one committee's work by starting another parallel process.

Women make up over 50 per cent of our community and they are very important to everyone, whether they are in business or not. This report was prepared in response to a request in June 1993 from the Hon. Kim Beazley for the council to examine the issues surrounding small business, employment growth and skills formation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report said that a number of strategies had been put in place to address the needs of young women and assist them with their career choices.

One of the most common causes of business failure has been identified as poor business planning, lack of business plans or underdeveloped business plans and unclear goals. Research indicated that women in particular are less likely to have a formal business plan at start-up than men. This is basically surprising to me as it was, I think, to the research team, given that one of the reasons identified for women having a higher success rate than men in the start-up of businesses is their more thorough research of the business start-up, taking longer and drawing on wider sources of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other areas, of course, can make it more difficult for women to start up in business. It is interesting to see here at the table today the minister who has a fair bit to do with child care. The council, in its deliberations, was made very much aware through the many submissions it received&mdash;in particular, on the supplementary work on women and small business&mdash;that one of the concerns in both establishing and operating a small business as an employee is child care and the other carer responsibilities. Unless they are properly and adequately provided, especially in country areas, it makes it very difficult for women to get into business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part of the survey made the point about finance. Historically, the point had been made that access to finance had been an area of concern for women, and one that has been generally perceived to be one of the main barriers to be overcome by women in establishing and operating a small business. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anecdotal evidence and research concerning women and their success in gaining access to finance however is contradictory and confusing.</PARA>
<PARA>A recent survey by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Australia</EMPHASIS> small business index found that there is no strong evidence that female small business proprietors are less successful in dealing with banks than are males and that women who applied for finance were, on average, more successful than their male counterparts. I think that is something that surely&mdash;if this research is correct, which I presume it is&mdash;has been put to rest. The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This finding contrasts with a belief by a sizeable proportion of the survey population . . . that banks and other financial institutions may treat women, in general, less sympathetically than they treat men.</PARA>
<PARA>I know that my wife, who is a partner with me in some businesses, can more than adequately hold her own with any bank manager, and I am sure that Senator Panizza's wife would be able to do the same. Women are generally very thorough in their approach to business, and the point was made that it is a myth that they are less likely to get finance. I am glad that myth has been put to rest in this report. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This land council is situated on Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria and adjacent to the east coast of the Northern Territory. It is a relatively new land council and one that has been operating very successfully. Whilst it is a small community where the Aboriginal residents live in two communities, Angurugu and Umbakumba, it is also important to look through the range of activities and the good administration of this land council. I am pleased with the report and pleased to note that it is an unqualified audit report that has been submitted along with the annual report of the council itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Groote Eylandt has a very historical background. It is an area where the community certainly is not without troubles of a social nature, and it needs to be constantly looked at very carefully by members of this parliament and the parliament in the Northern Territory. Nevertheless, the activities of this land council deserve our commendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make only one specific comment on the report itself. It relates to the notes forming part of the financial statements, specifically those listed at clause 17, both (a) and (b), which relate to the receipts and payments reconciliations for the royalty trust account. I note that mining royalties were received in the financial year of just over $3 million and, of that, $1.831 million was specifically allocated as a payment to the Groote Eylandt Aboriginal Trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am well aware that that particular trust, which has been existing for a number of years and has built up a very good capital and equity base, has been experiencing problems in this year relating to the distribution of and access to those funds. I am aware that the trust has been subjected to proposals of what I can only describe as a scandalous and crooked nature and it is to the credit of the trust that it has resisted some of the scams that have been put to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that some of the Aboriginal people and the trustees have, in effect, had to take court action to ensure that their safety and security is recorded.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have raised in a number of speeches in a number of debates recently my concern about this whole area of the administration of trust accounts on behalf of Aboriginal people. There are always competing interests in any trust, as we all know from our own family experiences, but it is also very important that trusts be very properly and carefully administered to ensure that the beneficial interests of the people who stand to benefit and the fiduciary duty of trustees are at all times carried out properly and effectively. I believe Mr Tickner and Senator Collins have had a close personal interest in the supervision of this trust. I would hope that the problems experienced in the last few months by the community will in fact be properly alleviated. </PARA>

<PARA>The Central Land Council administers a very significant part of the Northern Territory on behalf of the Aboriginal people who live in that particular area. It is therefore a very important voice on behalf of Aboriginal people. I am pleased to say that I have enjoyed a good relationship this year with the director and other staff of the Central Land Council. I am pleased to note that, whilst not being without controversy, as is natural in so many Aboriginal organisations, it continues to be an administratively sound organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opening statements of the director's report concern me. In his opening paragraph the director, Mr Tracker Tilmouth, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Four years ago Kumantjayi Ross, my predecessor in this job wrote: "I would like to report an improvement in conditions for Aboriginal people of central Australia but unfortunately I cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second paragraph is very important and powerful. In it Mr Tilmouth says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since then the Cold War has been settled, the Berlin Wall smashed, apartheid died a natural death, and Australian governments have made export industries of human rights and democracy. And still I cannot report an improvement in conditions for the Aboriginal people of central Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Tilmouth is dead right. The improvement of conditions and the plight of Aboriginal people in central Australia are a great indictment of the lack of proper, sensitive activity by this federal government. Further in the report there is comment, naturally, with regard to the native title claim preparations that the CLC has undertaken. The Central Land Council has begun the necessary anthropological and legal research and has a number of follow-up meetings of potential applicants with regard to a claim very specifically in the Alice Springs region. Of course, that needs to be carefully followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to a comment on page 43 of the report with regard to the Central Land Council unit assisting the Alcoota Aboriginal Corporation in management. This is one of the areas in which I am aware of criticism in the local communities. There was an article several weeks ago in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 7 February which reported the controversy that has arisen between the Central Land Council and its administration, a dispute with the local Aboriginal people and a dispute specifically with one of the traditional Aboriginal people very closely concerned in that area, Mr Arthur Turner. Mr Turner highlighted the frustrations and the problems that, since the purchase of the property with ATSIC funds about two years ago, the administration has not been properly settled. This is an area of dispute with the Central Land Council. Very obviously, it is an issue that needs to be carefully monitored and addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that in the financial statements of the Central Land Council there is an auditor's qualification with regard to the distributions that have been made under the trust provisions that are administered by this land council for distributions that have been made outside the period required by section 35 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. My attention is always drawn to areas where qualified reports have to be made. I note that the reasons for this non-compliance have obviously been given in a letter to the minister dated 6 January 1995. That is highlighted on the last page of the report, but the details are not given in this actual report. Given the amounts of money that flow through these trust and royalty accounts, I think that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the composition of the trust funds that have come in during the year are: royalty equivalents of almost $1.959 million, negotiated moneys received on behalf of a number of trusts of just over $3.5 million, rental and lease moneys attributed as $1.35 million, and a small amount of $161,000 from other sources. The offsetting payments have increased the equity in the trust amounts, but it does need closer attention and surveillance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This report, as usual, is a real doozey. It is one in which we get a number of conflicting and confusing issues. I have certainly, for a number of years, been very critical of the operations of the Northern Land Council. It is a body that has required considerable additional funding in top-up funds to those which it is entitled to under the Aboriginal land rights act, usually in the order of millions of dollars each year, to carry out its administrative functions. Those funds come at the expense of other Aborigines and community organisations then not having access to the particular areas of need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As senators will be aware, in other debate in this chamber yesterday I specifically addressed a number of issues of the principal fight that is going on between the Northern Land Council and the Gagadju Association for the Aboriginal people in the uranium rich Kakadu area of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me be specific as to why I express my concerns. They largely relate to the comments that were reflected in the rhetoric of the report relating to an important Australian National Audit Office review that took place on this land council in the financial year under consideration. The director in his comments&mdash;the chairman does also&mdash;makes specific comment about how the ANAO did find some areas where the operation and administration could be improved. Mr Pearce says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am happy to say the Land Council has come through stronger as a result of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>Further he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I intend to continue the process of reforms . . .</PARA>
<PARA>But of course in the report the Northern Land Council takes a swipe at me because I instituted the particular report. The report refers to supposed attacks on the land council that came from Senator Tambling and refer to the fact that these were politically charged attacks. There is one sentence I want to dispute very strongly. On page 44 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These favourable reports vindicate the integrity of the Land Council and dispel any implication of impropriety presented by Senator Tambling. Unfortunately the Senator has not acknowledged or apologised for his excesses.</PARA>
<PARA>What a load of rubbish! I certainly raised a lot of issues that required investigation and in fact 52 recommendations were put forward by the Australian National Audit Office as issues requiring attention and the Northern Land Council itself adopted 51 of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you look through that audit report, at the scope and the extent of all the changes that were necessary, I think every one of my points were satisfactorily borne out. When you also consider that each and every one of the concerns and issues I raised in this Senate that precipitated the Australian National Audit Office review came to me from the direct representation of Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory, I make no apology whatsoever for having raised them or having caused the Northern Land Council some concern and some heat in the kitchen during the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a range of activities that an important body like this must carry out, whether it is in the area of pastoral pursuits, mining pursuits or administration issues. Instead, we get a land council that is preoccupied with politics and ends up far too often, as it did in the past until it turned the corner a year or so ago, just another arm of the ALP left wing faction. Thankfully that issue has been addressed. The audit report pulled that up and we do not see the manipulation that was going on for years and resulted in a lot of Aboriginal money being improperly taken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to comment again on the area of the trust accounts that are listed in the notes forming part of the financial statements of this particular land council. I note that the receipts that were received during the year on behalf of the royalty trust account were some $4.2 million of statutory royalty equivalents and other moneys&mdash;let me highlight that&mdash;of over $3.7 million. Obviously, that is for moneys for negotiations on behalf of Aboriginal people, rents and royalties. The payments on the opposite side of the ledger were $8.7 million. Again, this needs to be carefully looked at&mdash;$3.7 million plus $4.2 million and all we get is a cursory glance in the end part of the report listing the balances of each of the royalty trust accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a fiduciary duty. Where that $3.7 million came from and where it was expended is not properly explained in the detail of this. It may be the property of Aboriginal people, but I would also draw it to the attention of the Senate as a matter requiring careful and fiduciary responsibility. </PARA>

This report, in the Tiwi Islanders' normal and competent manner, is unqualified and from that point of view I am very pleased to note the activities.

<PARA>The job losses in Victoria were exacerbated by a decision by the Commonwealth Bank to strip all head office activities out of Melbourne. Many Victorians believe that the bank is simply out of touch. Business complains that there is a lack of knowledge, particularly where Melbourne property is involved. Customers are deserting the banks in droves. According to Barbara Biggs in the Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> on 12 February, CBA staff are being verbally and physically abused by irate customers after massive staff reductions. The unions are also fed up with the attitude of the Commonwealth Bank. Mr Steve McKenna, the State Secretary of the Finance Sector Union, has been quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The way the Commonwealth has treated people in Victoria, both customers and staff, is appalling.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said that the Sydney based management of the Commonwealth Bank did not seem to care what happened in Victoria. That is why I said, at the start of my remarks, that I would have welcomed some support from Senator Carr on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does the management of the bank respond? To show how out of touch the bank remains, the managing director, David Murray, attacks complaints that decision making has become too centralised in Sydney. He is quoted as saying that this is a symptom of Melbourne's parochial nature. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is frustrating because we don't look at ourselves as being a Sydney bank; we look at ourselves as a distinctly Australian bank. It is an issue for us.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Mr Murray may not consider the Commonwealth Bank a Sydney bank, but it might help if he put himself in the shoes of other people outside of Sydney. Better still, he might put some of his top management outside of Sydney. Virtually all decision making is now done in the Sydney headquarters. Of the Commonwealth Bank's 23 executives, 17 are in Sydney and just one is in Melbourne. The CBA has a significant proportion of its assets in Melbourne; apparently one-quarter of its loan portfolio is in Victoria. But Victoria, as I said, has only one of the 23 senior executives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The merged CBA has clearly lost ground in Victoria as a result of employee and customer disenchantment. In December 1990, the Commonwealth plus the State Bank of Victoria had 42.6 per cent of the housing loan market. By last October, that figure had slumped to 35 per cent. When the Commonwealth Bank acquired the State Bank, it inherited a 13 per cent share of the housing loan market worth $5.7 billion. It has, according to this week's BRW, effectively lost half of this. The excuse proffered by Mr Murray is totally unconvincing. He argues in the BRW article that the integration of the State Bank in the Commonwealth Bank caused disruption and `was bound to cost market share'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, at the time of the merger, the chairman of the bank, Mr Besley, said, `I can see the merger being effected smoothly without difficulty.' In short, the bank's management  has squandered the significant gains it received as a result of the merger. Mr Besley should be sending a please explain note to the bank's management. It is time that the Commonwealth Bank told us precisely what its plans are. Despite the massive job losses, we read in the BRW article that there may be further substantial closures of branches, presumably resulting in further major losses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight, the cabinet of the government is considering the question of greenhouse, and I just wish to make a few remarks on the importance of this issue. The earth's atmosphere is now changing more rapidly than at any time during the whole history of this planet. It is being changed because of the activities of human beings, particularly because of the burning of fossil fuel. We do not know exactly what the consequences of that will be, but the matter is serious and is regarded as such by most of the senior scientists who look at it. Indeed, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has thrice recommended that globally we need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 per cent, simply to cause the level of gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to level off at approximately twice what they would have been had we maintained the level at the pre-industrial concentration. Nobody knows exactly what a doubling of CO(2) will do in terms of increased temperature, climate change and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than four years ago, the government adopted interim planning targets to get the reduction to 1990 levels and then get a 20 per cent reduction below that level by the year 2005. More than two years ago, in December 1992, the government, in its intergovernmental agreement on the environment with the state governments, said that it would adopt and adhere to the national greenhouse response strategy. I think the Senate needs to know and the people of Australia need to understand that nothing has happened either at state level or at federal level to actually implement that national greenhouse response strategy. So the meeting tonight is important. It is particularly important because it precedes by less than a month the meeting in Berlin at which countries will hopefully get locked down with some more certain strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few days, a booklet has appeared authored by Dr George Wilkenfeld of George Wilkenfeld and Associates&mdash;and those who know anything about the strategies for energy efficiency and the use of alternative energy would know that Dr Wilkenfeld has had a long and very credible history of work in this area&mdash;Dr Clive Hamilton of the Australia Institute and Dr Hugh Sadler, both of whom have a long history of association, Dr Clive Hamilton with the Resource Assessment Commission, and Hugh Sadler specifically in the area of energy efficiency and alternative energy. I would like to read into the record the comments of these three experts about the inadequacy of the government's response in relation to greenhouse. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Greenhouse Response Strategy (NGRS) agreed between the Commonwealth and the States has failed to make any impact on Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. After two years of its operation, there is no evidence that even one tonne of carbon emissions has been saved as a result of the NGRS. Moreover, Australia's excess of emissions over the target of the Framework Convention on Climate Change&mdash;to return to 1990 levels by the year 2000&mdash;is likely to be far greater than has been admitted by the Commonwealth Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, Australia has passed up substantial `no-regrets' gains in energy efficiency, and our ability to participate effectively in international efforts to tackle climate change has been seriously compromised. Indeed, if all countries adopt a position based on special pleading, as Australia appears to be doing, then the complex and difficult international negotiations to reach a feasible agreement could collapse&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I think that is that particularly important remark in view of the Berlin meeting. They continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The threat of climate change is a global one, and all nations need to consider whether they will participate in global efforts to address it. A rational and prudent assessment of the risks means that governments, companies and individuals must all take steps to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of those activities over which they have control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of global warming is a classic case of an `externality', that is, a cost associated with an activity that is not met by the producer or consumer. This, combined with the long-term nature of the greenhouse problem, will require that governments take the lead in developing the response framework and implementing policies to reduce emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the NGRS derives from a failure of governments to show leadership, to reconcile conflicting policy objectives and to distinguish the public interest from narrow commercial interests. This has been compounded by a lack of knowledge of the energy market in parts of the bureaucracy, and a lack of informed public debate and scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nearly every major energy supply decision taken in Australia in the two years since the NGRS was adopted has favoured the option with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">higher</EMPHASIS> greenhouse gas emissions. In instances where governments have not themselves directly made the decisions, they have failed to give the decision makers concerned any signal that greenhouse gas emissions need serious consideration.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the foreseeable future, the national gains from carefully targeted action will far exceed the national losses, and substantial greenhouse gas reductions can be achieved at zero or negative cost.

<PARA>something that fortunately the opposition has adopted in its statement that was put out by Mr McLachlan only a few weeks ago; and I hope that actually means that the opposition is not going to clear any more forests because it says in its policy that it is going to end land clearing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a clear strategy for transition to renewable energy use in the longer term; and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is well aware of the fact that the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee is undertaking an inquiry into soccer football in Australia. As stated in an advertisement for the inquiry, its terms of reference are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to inquire into the role of coaches, players, agents, clubs, officials, and others in the transfer of Australian sportspeople, and into any other matters relating to corruption, conflicts of interest, tax evasion, and improper financial transactions, with particular reference to the sport of soccer; and review the report by the Hon. D.G. Stewart to the Australian Soccer Federation; and that the Committee report to the Senate on this matter by 11 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee invited persons and organisations, as stated further on in that advertisement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . wishing to express views on matters relating to this reference to lodge written submissions (which may, if necessary, be made on a confidential basis) by 28 February 1995&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is today. The advertisement also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee will consider all submissions and may invite parties to give supporting evidence at public or <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">in camera</EMPHASIS> hearings. Proceedings of the Committee and its witnesses are protected by Parliamentary privilege. Submissions become the property of the Committee and are only made public after a decision by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is adequate protection for those people who want to give evidence to improve the standing of this sport by revealing some of the major problems that appear to be creating a great deal of difficulty in it. People will be provided with protection&mdash;protection that was not available to the Stewart inquiry, which revealed, nonetheless, a great many damaging matters. Those people who, like me, are very keen to see this sport emerge stronger, more effectively and better managed than it is at the moment would have hoped that many Australians involved in the sport of soccer or concerned about its welfare would have come forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the close of business today, something like only 20 people had professed a willingness to give evidence to this committee.

I have received plenty of anonymous correspondence and many anonymous phone calls pointing me in some interesting directions in relation to corruption and conflicts of interest, and so on. But it is a matter of major concern to me that many people who can contribute important information to this inquiry have not come forward because they fear for their own futures in the sport either in their playing role or in their administrative role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To an extent, this problem may well have been compounded by the fact that absolutely nothing has happened so far in response to the recommendations of the Stewart inquiry which was held by the ASF itself. In fact, one of the commissioners who stood aside during an inquiry into his involvement with the Marconi club&mdash;and that related to a Licensing Court hearing&mdash;and who was severely criticised in the Stewart report has, in fact, now resumed his membership of the Australian Soccer Federation, despite the fact of a very unfavourable report being made by the Licensing Court which has asked him to show cause why he should not be prevented from holding any club office for the next 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a failure to take action on the Stewart report. People are saying, `We will wait until the Senate committee report comes out.' To an extent, people are saying, `Wait until we see whether you should be run over by a 20-tonne truck or a five-tonne truck.' The Stewart report made some very strong recommendations. We will obviously be examining them. I fear that the decision by the ASF to not take action on the Stewart report until the Senate committee has responded diminishes the prospect of people coming forward to provide us with evidence, because they are concerned that nothing will be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend to the ASF that the people who are criticised should at least be asked to step aside. Some kind of sanction should be applied, even if it is not the dismissal that Stewart recommended. Otherwise, we will have difficulty convincing people that there is merit in their coming forward to try to clean up this operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter I want to raise is the general question of conflicts of interest. This matter affects quite a few sports, but none as dramatically as soccer, as has been shown. People should very closely examine it in terms of propriety. One might be a director of the Australian Soccer Federation Ltd. It is all very well to be involved in commercial transactions with it that are stated to be in the normal course of business. But there is always the suggestion that it is some kind of deal for the boys if one is involved in that way. That is why I raised this matter last year and suggested that the soccer inquiry be expanded to cover the question of conflicts of interest, which has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice in the annual report of the Australian Soccer Federation, which was dealt with last weekend at its annual meeting, that two transactions once again relate to directors of the federation. One of them, Mr Constantine, has since resigned. He is the principal of Constantine &amp; Co Solicitors which rendered legal advice to the economic entity; that is, the federation. All dealings were in the ordinary course of business and on normal commercial terms and conditions. Fees paid to Constantine &amp; Co Solicitors during the year totalled $110,275. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been accusations on a commercial television station that some overcharging was involved in these fees. These allegations need answering. Perhaps a Senate inquiry may well be an appropriate place to answer them. It demonstrates how unwise it is for people involved in organisations like this one to also be involved in trading relationships with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another was a director of the federation, Mr Anthony Labbozzetta. He has an interest as a partner in the business Marconi Travel. I understand that that interest is with his brother. This business renders services in connection with travel arrangements with the federation in respect of interstate and international travel. All dealings with the business are in the ordinary course of business and on normal commercial terms and conditions. Moneys paid to Marconi Travel during the year in respect of travel arrangements amounted to $235,102. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the report says, these are normal business dealings. But, as I said, there is always this suggestion that those involved might get some special deal. I am not making that accusation. It is one of the natural consequences of this sort of thing. It is unfortunate for the ASF at this time that so many of the commissioners seem to have some commercial or financial relationship to the ASF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that another commissioner is a trade debtor to the ASF. I do not know on what terms or basis, but it is not disclosed in this report. It is certainly unfortunate. I hope that under the Senate inquiry all these question marks are resolved satisfactorily. One question mark, which is the role of coach Mr Rale Rasic, has been resolved, at least as far as his club is concerned. Mr Rasic was severely criticised in the Stewart report for allegedly requiring people to take out insurance policies in order to get into his club team. As I understand it, that club, Parramatta Eagles, has sacked Mr Rasic, but not on those grounds; it simply did so on the grounds that his coaching was not providing the club with enough wins. But this whole series of problems has to be resolved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to raise three issues in relation to the production of chicken meat in Australia. I raise these issues under three headings: public health; genetic engineering; and animal welfare. In relation to this matter, I draw the attention of the Senate to the very informative annual report of the Chicken Meat Research and Development Council for 1993-94. I will refer to that report because it is very germane to the issues that I wish to speak about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the critical nature of public health issues is being recognised at last. The terrible outbreak of disease which occurred recently in Adelaide through the consumption of processed meat goods shows how vital it is to have the highest standards in this area. The smallest lapse in standards can have very tragic outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently met with representatives from the Chicken Growers Association in Queensland. They raised some matters with me which cause apprehension. They raised concerns about the potential problems in ensuring that high health standards are maintained in light of the loosening restrictions accompanying the adoption of the GATT agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, Senator Boswell asked a question of Senator Collins in this place about the importation of chicken meat into Australia. In his answer, Senator Collins assured the Senate that AQIS has developed a protocol for the importation of chicken meat and that this protocol is the best in the world. I suggest that an even better solution to the best protocols in the world is to not import chicken meat at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, I met with representatives of AQIS. They did not disagree with me when I put to them that if we did not import chicken meat we would not need either protocols to prevent disease or to raise the apprehension of Australian people about the importation of disease. I will quote from this report the concerns raised about public health issues. They demonstrate the depth of these concerns. Page 23 of the report, under the heading `Public health', reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research and development in this area has the objective of improving measures to safeguard public health. To achieve this objective, Council recognises the need to support research and development to:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.identify ways to reduce the dissemination of Salmonella, Campylobacter and Listeria in the processing, handling and storage environments.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly those representatives of the Chicken Growers Association who came to me underlined the great dangers  inherent in importing chicken meat into Australia in terms of these health risks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go a little further. My whole philosophy of life is that people ought to grow their own food. That in itself is worthy of debate in this place. I will not engage in such a debate tonight, but I certainly intend to engage in it at another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that any exports should be in excess of domestic needs and should be in those markets where there is a real need to feed people who are unable to feed themselves. This philosophy does not extend to the importation of chicken meat into Australia. We can supply all the chicken meat we need from our own domestic industry. Why take the risk? It is simply not worth it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to the issue of genetic engineering. Concerns are repeatedly expressed by ethicists, scientists, church groups and environmentalists about the dangers and undesirability of genetic engineering. I concede it is a vexed issue rather than a simple black-and-white matter. Nonetheless, I believe insufficient consideration has been given to the many matters involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the chicken industry is no exception. Page 55 of the same report details research into introducing certain genes into embryonic cells with an eye to improving growth and production characteristics of chickens. I read again from this report to underline the nature of this research. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ability to genetically engineer poultry is dependent on two major steps, (1) to establish a means by which genes of interest can be introduced into suitable embryonic cells and (2) to be able to culture those cells containing the introduced gene to produce a chimeric embryo through to hatching. This project aims to address both of these steps.</PARA>
<PARA>There is growing concern about the necessity for this kind of intervention, and legislation to regulate or even take account of this kind of genetic engineering is way behind the development of scientific techniques. The public debate, in terms of this kind of genetic engineering, is indeed out of sight. What is evident from representations I have had is that Australian consumers do not need, nor do they desire, to eat food genetically engineered in this manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn finally to the issue of animal welfare. Animal welfare issues have become more significant in the public consciousness in recent times. The use of animals for food production is one of the focal points of such concerns. Whilst chicken meat production generally does not have the horrendous problems still associated with battery hens used in egg production, there are still animal welfare issues which need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report I have referred to tonight details some research into improving bird welfare, but it is predominantly motivated by a wish to improve productivity. Two projects are outlined in the report. One is aimed at identifying and reducing human behaviour which causes fear in chickens, and the other project is aimed at ensuring that broiler sheds are maintained at optimum temperatures to reduce heat stress for the chickens and to improve their productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats are grateful for these initiatives. They are certainly in the right direction. However, much remains to be done before the Democrats will be convinced that the humane treatment of other animals produced for eating has reached an acceptable level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot let it pass without comment that we now know the Australian Democrats' trade policy in relation to primary produce. As stated by Senator Woodley tonight, the Democrat trade policy, or at least his trade policy, is this: we should not export primary produce from this country unless it is, first, surplus to our domestic requirements and, secondly, the people to whom we send it are incapable of producing it themselves. That is a remarkable policy because, at best, it reduces Australian farmers to being unpaid aid merchants for other countries. If people cannot afford to produce the primary produce themselves, the food themselves, it stands to reason they cannot afford to pay for it. If they cannot afford to pay for it, heaven knows why we would want to produce it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farming in this country relies on people being able to make a profit, yet Senator Woodley would deny our farmers and our primary producers the opportunity to make a profit because we are allowed to do things only for charity. That is Senator Woodley's policy. If one were more charitable, one could say maybe Senator Woodley means something else&mdash;but not on the words he used. Quite clearly, the Japanese could say that they will not accept Australian beef because they can produce their own beef in Japan. That would completely overlook the fact that the Japanese would be producing the beef for their domestic requirements at three or four times the price of the beef that we ship to Japan because they would be closing the market and there would be an excess of demand over supply&mdash;but that is a consequence of what Senator Woodley said in his remarks. Senator Woodley had ample time to consider what he has had to say. Senator Woodley came in here to make a statement. He carefully thought it out; it was all written down. That is the Democrat trade policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next time the Democrats get up in this parliament or outside this parliament and say they are the great friends of the primary producers of this country, let it be on the record that we know what their real policy is. Their real policy is to reduce primary producers to being unpaid aid merchants, to reduce this country generally to a subsistence standard of living and to turn back the clock to the 19th century. As far as I am concerned, that policy belongs with people from the 19th century. Maybe Senator Woodley is the only person who would rationally expound such a view in this place today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Treasurer, upon notice, on 22 February 1994:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With reference to short-term United States (US) expatriates working in Australia: under the Superannuation Guarantee Charge (SGC) legislation certain categories of employees qualify for exemption. Included in these exemptions are holders of executive (overseas) visas or entry permits (code number 413) Granted under the Australian migration regulations. These visas are generally issued to persons working in a capacity which an Australian resident would not be qualified; however, the great majority of US expatriates working in Australia hold different classes of visas, for example, 414 (specialist overseas), 442 (occupational trainee) or 411 (exchange) which are not exempted from the SGC:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Is it a fact that, under US law, SGC contributions made on behalf of these expatriates will be subject to US tax in the year of contribution, and income derived from the investment of these contributions will be subject to US tax as it accrues, unless the fund in which they are made into can comply with certain US requirements, which is highly unlikely. In addition, due to the operation of the Australia/US Double Taxation Agreement, is it a fact that a full tax credit for Australian taxes paid on eligible termination payments made to the expatriate may not be available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Given also that the continued membership in a US retirement plan for a US expatriate is dependent upon, amongst other things, not receiving retirement funding from a foreign affiliate, and that contributions made under the SGC may cause the expatriate to lose eligibility for membership of the US retirement plan, will the Government consider exempting these visa holders as it has already done to holders of class 413 executive (overseas) visas and entry permits and, as has been indicated by the Assistant Treasurer, non-residents who receive prize money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Is the Treasurer aware of any expatriates other than from the US working on a short-term basis in Australia facing similar difficulties.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1106" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) While interpretation of US tax laws is ultimately a matter for the US authorities, it appears that certain Australian "pension plans" may be entitled to concessions under the US tax laws, including exemption of fund income and deferral of employee's tax on employer contributions until benefits are paid. There are a number of requirements limiting contributions and benefits, commencement of benefits and minimum distributions which must be met for a pension plan to qualify for these concessions. In the absence of specific details it is not possible to say whether particular superannuation schemes might qualify for those concessions under US tax laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Article 22(1) of the Australian/US Double Tax Convention, the US provides a credit to US residents or citizens for the "appropriate amount of income taxes paid to Australia". This credit is provided subject to the limitations of the law of the US. One possible limitation is that (as with Australian law) the amount of the foreign tax credit is limited to the US tax that would otherwise be payable on the foreign income. It should also be noted that, where expatriate US residents consider actions of either country have resulted in taxation not in accordance with the Convention, they may present their case to "competent" authorities who will try to resolve the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Whether or not superannuation contributions made to satisfy the SGC arrangements would disentitle US expatriates to continued membership in a US retirement plan is a matter for US authorities and/or the relevant US retirement plan to determine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is relevant, nevertheless, that the Government has appointed an independent committee to review policies and procedures governing the temporary entry for work of business personnel into Australia. In December 1994, the Committee released a draft report which included, inter alia, a proposal to collapse into one visa sub-class all business temporary residents; ie those presently entering Australia under visa sub-classes 411 (exchange), 412 (independent executive), 413 (executive (overseas) (employed)) and 414 (specialist), and to exempt them from the SGC. The report calls for public submissions on its proposals to be made by 24 February 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will consider any recommendations the Committee may make in this area in its final report, due by June 1995. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has, in its Fifteenth Report, also made a recommendation in this general area, to which the Government will respond. In considering proposals to exempt further categories of temporary residents, the Government will be concerned to avoid the possibility of such exemptions giving rise to labour market distortions, especially once the SGC contribution rate rises to 9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the meantime, to the extent that the existing policy gives rise to any particular taxation and other difficulties in the home countries of persons affected, these matters are best pursued with the relevant authorities in those countries by the expatriates concerned. It will also remain the case, of course, that temporary entrants to Australia may withdraw any superannuation contributions made on their behalf on permanently departing the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Government has received a number of representations about the application of the SGC to </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the expatriates of other countries. These representations have not, however, alluded to similar taxation and pension plan issues as have been raised by the honourable senator in respect of US expatriates.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Health Communication Network (HCN) is an initiative of Health Ministers, both State and Commonwealth. The HCN sets out to improve the flow of health information in a safe, secure and effective manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HCN was first discussed in 1991 at a Health and Telecommunications Industry workshop sponsored by Health Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1992, the HCN project has undertaken consultations, studies and demonstration projects to provide tangible and supportable evidence of the uses and benefits of the HCN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July 1993 Australian Health Ministers agreed to the establishment of the HCN as a company by 1994 with an independent board. A company was considered the most appropriate vehicle because the health sector has clearly indicated it does not feel comfortable with Government, neither Commonwealth nor State, dealing with its information and secondly, the Health Communication Network is to be set up on commercial grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development and implementation of the Health Communication Network has to date been funded by the Commonwealth Government ($1.8m in 92-93, $2.0m in 1993-94 and an estimated $6.6m in 1994-96).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) (a) A total of 447 submissions were received by the Industry Commission in relation to the Charitable Organisations inquiry prior to the release of the Draft Report on 27 October 1994. In addition, the Commission visited or met 157 organisations in Australia during the above period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Those making submissions were not asked to specify the groups which they represented. Therefore, it is not possible to identify precisely those submissions which are particular to organisations representing ethnic communities. Eighty-five submissions make at least some reference to ethnic issues. Of these, twenty-six claim to, at least to some extent, represent ethnic groups or target services to ethnic groups. Six submissions were from organisations which appear to have ethnic communities as their primary focus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inability to identify precisely the representation of organisations also applies to those groups with which the Commission held discussions. Five of the organisations visited appeared to have migrant or ethnic communities as their primary focus. Many other meetings, such as those with the State Councils of Social Service, were with peak groups which included organisations focused on ethnic communities, and many organisations visited had general or specialist programs which provided services to ethnic communities. The author of the report referred to by Senator Woodley, for example, was present at one of the meetings with the New South Wales Council of Social Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) (a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Yes. However, the Commission has undertaken an extensive information dissemination program in relation to the Charitable Organisations inquiry. This comprised components aimed at the general community, of which ethnic groups are a part, and elements targeted specifically at ethnic groups. Separate advertisements announcing the inquiry and the hearing dates and venues were placed in all major metropolitan newspapers. Shortly after the inquiry was announced, Commissioners addressed briefing meetings convened by the Councils of Social Service, and which included representatives of the ethnic community. Commissioners and staff also completed a large number of subsequent print and radio interviews, speaking engagements and visits to promote awareness of the inquiry, including visits to ethnic groups. An interested party list of over 1700 individuals and organisations has been kept fully informed of the progress of the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The Industry Commission has noted the concerns of the Ethnic Communities Council of New South Wales in relation to the Commission's implementation of the Commonwealth Government's Access and Equity Strategy. While there may be room for improvement in procedures for making contact with members of these target groups, the methodology used in the report referred to by Senator Woodley is questionable in that the findings appear to be strongly based on a desk study of Commission reports. This style of assessment involved a basic count of submissions received and presentations made at hearings across a small number of Inquiries. It appears not to account for the very extensive public consultation, through industry visits and discussions with interested parties, which forms part of Commission inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also appears that there was little consultation by the author of the report with external agencies which have had involvement with the Commission's inquiry process. Furthermore, no input was sought from the Commission at any stage of the preparation of this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) The Commission has engaged a consultant to review and assess the effectiveness of its implementation of the Access and Equity Strategy, and to make recommendations as to how its processes might be improved. The consultant's report is due in early 1995. The Commission will give careful consideration to any recommendations to determine if, and how, its inquiry processes can be improved.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In November 1992, the Commonwealth entered into joint arrangements with the governments of South Australia, Northern Territory and Western Australia to establish a new service for Aboriginal people in the Tri-State region. One aspect of this project is to monitor the health status of Aboriginal people in relation to Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV. The monitoring of communicable diseases in Australia is done by the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Under the first National HIV/AIDS Strategy in 1989-90, nearly $2.5 million was approved under the Commonwealth AIDS Prevention and Education (CAPE) Program and the Commonwealth AIDS Workforce Information Standard and Exchange (CAWISE) Program for projects specifically targeting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
