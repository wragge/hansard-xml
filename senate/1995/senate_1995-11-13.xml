<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I remind the minister that, when last week's figures showed 740,000 Australians out of work and the position getting worse, Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, said `the economy is in a very nice position'. On what basis did the Prime Minister make those comments, when we have the worst current account deficit in the industrialised world, the second highest real interest rate in the same community and the second highest inflation rate&mdash;except for the last three months, when it was the worst in the OECD? What comfort is there for people struggling to deal with rising prices, rising unemployment and uncertainty about their mortgage rates? Doesn't this again demonstrate a Prime Minister&mdash;an arrogant Prime Minister&mdash;out of touch with the real struggles of ordinary Australians?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition continues in the role of being a serial assassin on the economy: talking down the Australian economy and undermining confidence. Fortunately, though, for the real economy&mdash;not the one that the opposition talks about in here, but the one that actually operates in the Australian community&mdash;we see, in terms of the indicators on business confidence and the indicators on consumer confidence, that, while certainly they have dipped a little from a very high spike, nonetheless in historic terms the levels of business confidence in the Australian economy and the levels of confidence exhibited in this economy by consumers remain very high. That may not encourage the opposition, which wants of course to talk down the economy. Nonetheless, the people out there who invest money and the consumers who purchase goods regard the economy as strong and, indeed, the economy is on a sustainable growth path.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the underlying inflation rate has risen a little over the last six months, but it remains at extremely low levels&mdash;certainly at extremely low levels compared to the economy that Mr Howard presided over when he was Treasurer in which inflation was at 11.4 per cent, as I recall. Certainly we have broken the back of that. We are combining a solid growth performance with a moderate inflation performance and, for the first time in a generation, have got the levels of growth and inflation under control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pick-up in inflation which we have seen comes on the back of four years of sustained economic growth in this country. The national accounts which will be released at the end of this month I believe will show that we have had four years and one quarter of sustained and consecutive economic growth, which will be a new record for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of this question focused on employment. The recent moderation in employment growth is not unexpected. It follows six months of extraordinary growth in employment. There were 200,000 jobs created in the first six months of this year, which is almost more than the job growth in the last five years of the Howard government put together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent moderation of employment growth has to be seen in perspective. Employment growth for the year so far is around 160,000 new jobs. In any case, employment as an indicator is a lagging indicator. It says to us what has happened; it does not say to us what will happen. Now that the economy has slowed and we have sustainable growth, we expect employment to grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are now a quarter of a million more Australians in work this year than there were at the same time last year. That is because of the sustainable economic growth of this economy, which is, as I say, in inflation terms still at a low level. The fundamentals of this economy are sound. The fundamentals cannot be sabotaged by the serial assassins of the opposition who want to talk the economy down. Business confidence in the economy is high. Consumer confidence is high as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have Access Economics' investment monitor reporting $162 billion worth of new investment projects which are either under construction, planned or under consideration at present.

We are talking rising unemployment; we are talking about the future of 740,000 Australians still out of work. What they want to know is whether it is in fact the case that we do have the second highest real interest rates in the industrialised world&mdash;this is under your administration, under your government&mdash;the second highest inflation rate in the industrialised world and the worst current account deficit in the industrialised world.

I answered him on a couple of those indicators, and he changes the question to suit the ones he really wants to focus on.

They each require a yes or no answer. We are seeking information from the minister. We have put things to him about the abysmal state of the economy in three respects. He is simply being asked to confirm or deny. That is not a difficult thing to do. You have now had enough opportunity to see that he is going to waffle on about the fundamentals.

Because the economy has been growing so strongly, it cannot generate sufficient product within the domestic economy and is sucking in goods from outside. That is one of the reasons why we have a high current account deficit. That is not because the economy is weak; that is because the economy is strong, Senator Hill.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GB6">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is also directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. Is the minister aware of the uncertainty within the Western Australian business community about the so-called second and third wave industrial relations reforms? What are the implications of this uncertainty both for industry in Western Australia and for the wider Australian community?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2714" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that everyone in the business community in Western Australia and nationally were pleased to see that the Trades and Labour Council of Western Australia and the Western Australian government reached an agreement&mdash;not in full, but in part&mdash;about withdrawing from legislation some of the more obnoxious and provocative elements of the Western Australian second wave industrial relations changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has given rise to continuing anxiety and concern for the Western Australian business community is that the Premier of Western Australia, Dick Court, said at the time in which he withdrew these changes that he was doing so in order to force his legislation through by the end of the year. The industrial relations minister in Western Australia, Mr Graham Keirath, has countermanded that. In the weekend press, the Premier has come out and agreed with Mr Keirath that in fact the real reason why the Western Australian government has done a somersault on its industrial relations legislation is nothing at all to do with its own legislative program but is to do with the federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation in which the federal coalition and no doubt Mr Howard have prevailed upon the Western Australian government to remove their second wave of legislation and to therefore reduce the provocation to the workers of Western Australia, the consequential disruption to the economy and the consequential loss of faith in the Western Australian economy by investors, both domestic and foreign. They have done so for simply electoral purposes. This is not a clear signal of real intent; it is a signal of deceit&mdash;deceit that the changes that have now been withdrawn by the Western Australian government may be held back and then brought forward following a federal election in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just the second wave. We know that in the second wave there are quite a number of quite profoundly obnoxious things that even the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry objected to, the mining industry objected to and the very conservative editorial writers of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper objected to as well. It seems that these are now being held back to be visited upon the undeserving Western Australian community after a federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to even go to the third wave. Just the other week, on the eve of some of the most sensitive industrial relations negotiations in the state of Western Australia, Mr Keirath, the industrial relations minister, announced that given that they were in negotiations about a second wave, there would be a third wave. This man, who is increasingly seen as an ideologue with nothing more than militant intent to impose his ideology on the community, has created widespread discord in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is the signal this sends to the Australian business community. The Australian business community is aware that the Western Australian industrial legislation is a trial horse for the Howard-Reith industrial legislation that they would visit nationally on Australia should they, unfortunately, win elective office in this country. The business community, which has recognised and valued the industrial calm and harmony created by this government&mdash;a government which has emphasised cooperation in the work place, not confrontation&mdash;appreciates that we are now going through a time during which we are enjoying the lowest level of industrial disputation since the war and since the industrial dispute figures have been collected. They are worried about the intent of the opposition in this case. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Does the government support the 15 per cent across-the-board wage claim being pursued by the building workers union and supported by the ACTU President, Jennie George? How does the across-the-board nature of the claim assist in the development of enterprise bargaining? Why is the Masters Builders' Association wrong in claiming that the 15 per cent wage increase could lead to both increased inflationary pressures and the loss of 20,000 jobs on top of the 80,000 jobs it predicts will be shed as a result of the collapse of the home building industry and increasing difficulties in the commercial construction sector?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not entirely sure that this is a question for the Treasurer. It seems more likely to be a question for the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, and it seems that the question should be appropriately directed to that minister, my colleague Senator Robert Ray. However, since the question has been asked of me, albeit erroneously and perhaps on a misunderstanding or simply from ignorance, let me go to the answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has set up an industrial relations system in Australia which has decentralised wage fixing from a highly centralised system to one which is enterprise based. In the context of enterprise bargaining in the building sector&mdash;or in any other sector&mdash;claims will be served which are ambit in nature and which will be supported by the unions and rejected by employers. One hopes in all of those cases that the two parties can get together to amicably negotiate an outcome to which they both feel bound, and productivity grows as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our industrial relations reform has been achieved without any major hiccup in the industrial relations environment and without any significant lost time because of a transition from one model to another model&mdash;from centralised to decentralised bargaining. That is not to say that there will not be disputes at the time enterprise bargains are struck. Both the coalition model, to the extent we know anything at all about it, and our model recognise the inevitability of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not for me to judge the validity or otherwise of individual claims in industry. It is for the parties in that industry to work that out and to find a basis for exchanging productivity growth for wage increases. Our model, which has lowered industrial disputation in Australia, has also worked to grow labour productivity to historically high levels in this country and to high levels according to OECD standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept Senator Parer's invitation. I am not familiar with the arguments in this individual case and I am not the appropriate minister on this occasion. I do not accept the opposition's arguments and I will not go to the individual case. It is for the parties to work that out and for the parties to feel bound by the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we do know is that the opposition is incubating an industrial relations policy which, if the opposition were elected to government, would be provocative and would end the period of industrial harmony which this nation has enjoyed and promote industrial disputation.</PARA>

The opposition says it has a safety net in place. It is a very narrow safety net. If you were a trapeze artist, it would be like trying to fall onto a tightrope. Our safety net is a very broad one which protects real workers, and their real interests, and enables them to bargain with some dignity with their employers. If the opposition wants to escape the perception of the Australian people about its policies, one of the things it has to do is adopt our principles in terms of award protection and worker protection by having a dinkum safety net to protect individual workers.</PARA></TALK.START>

But I suspect that he would say something like this: unlike the coalition, we as government are not going to insert ourselves in every industrial dispute between the parties, and we are not going to judge the competing arguments that the parties put forward. What we are going to do is create a framework for the parties to negotiate successfully, basically on the grounds of growing productivity to fund wage increases, and do so without taking sides in that in order that the outcome of those negotiations can be the property of both parties, affirmed by them and therefore supported and carried through by them.

Yesterday on Channel 10's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press </EMPHASIS>program the opposition's environment spokesman, Senator Rod Kemp, accused the government of using the external affairs power as a `constitutional battering ram'. What is the government's approach to the use of international treaties to protect the environment?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2717" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government remains committed to active participation in the negotiation and implementation of international treaties which deal with environmental issues of global dimensions. It is well known that that is our position. We make no bones about it. There is no equivocation, there is no fumbling, there is no mumbling, and there is no stumbling of the kind that poor old Elmer subjected us to in his performance yesterday morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether the coalition likes it or not&mdash;and obviously it doesn't very much&mdash;the need for international cooperation on the environment is increasing rather than diminishing. And this government does take its responsibility as a good international citizen seriously. We also take very seriously our responsibility to protect the environment, using such constitutional mechanisms as are reasonably available to us. The difficulty about the opposition is that it is caught in a time warp between, on the one hand, the hairy-chested posturing to those it has tried to convince that the government is misusing the external affairs power and, on the other hand, the green constituency that it is belatedly&mdash;and now incompetently&mdash;trying to woo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Senator Kemp was asked whether he could provide just one example of where the government had improperly used its external affairs power. Back-pedalling furiously, we had Senator Kemp saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I think the particular debate has moved on and I think the Government is pulling back from the position it had in the `80s . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Either he couldn't or he wouldn't produce a single example of where the Commonwealth had misused or inappropriately used the external affairs power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us look at where we did use the external affairs power during the 1980s when he said that it was misconceived. The facts are that it was used by us in a way that the opposition hated then and continues to hate now to protect the Franklin River, to stop logging in the Wet Tropics, to stop the building of the Quaid Road, just north of Cairns, and to stop logging in the Lemonthyme and the southern forests of Tasmania. I ask the opposition: which of those uses of the external affairs power in the 1980s was inappropriate? Which was inappropriate then? Which would be inappropriate now? Senator Kemp did not tell us, and he cannot tell us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the government has much more recently used the external affairs power at Hinchinbrook to prevent the Great Barrier Reef from an inappropriate development which we all know about. Senator Kemp was asked his views about this. He simply did not know what to say. He stumbled and fumbled, and he said that the use of powers came under an act of parliament. Of course it came under an act of parliament. One would have thought that after eight months in the job he would have worked out that the act which was used, the act of parliament which was at issue here to protect the Great Barrier Reef, was exactly the same act of parliament enacted in reliance on the external affairs power that was used to save the Franklin and the rainforests of North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about that act of parliament was not that it was an act of parliament but that it was an act of parliament built in reliance on the external affairs power. It was an act to implement the World Heritage Convention. It was introduced by the Labor government in 1983, and we remain very proud indeed of that particular piece of legislation and never make any apology for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's position on the use of the external affairs power has not changed at all. The coalition has consistently been critical, in general terms, of the Commonwealth's use of the external affairs power. The alternative that it offers is, as a result, a Tasmanian wilderness that is dammed, world heritage rainforests that are logged and a Kakadu National Park that is mined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular issue, finally, of forests is one on which the opposition was left conspicuously stumbling yesterday. Senator Kemp was asked what he thought the opposition's view was on the government's endeavour to protect additional forests. The government, of course, supports the world-class 15 per cent reserve criteria. The opposition did not answer the question: does it support that 15 per cent criteria? Does it support the much weaker 10 per cent criteria proposed by the Liberal state government? You did not tell us yesterday. You cannot tell us.

I just want to point out to Senator Campbell: the most recent ABS data indicates that, over the year to October 1995, the teenage unemployment rate increased in seasonally adjusted terms from 28.3 per cent to 29 per cent, and the number of full-time unemployed teenagers showed a slight increase of 200 to 95,600. Over the year to September 1995, however, the latest ABS data shows that, in original terms, the unemployment rate of the 20- to 24-year-old group fell from 12.6 per cent to 11.6 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government acknowledges, of course, that youth unemployment continues to be a serious problem. It has introduced a range of measures, including Austudy, Working Nation's youth training initiative, and the recently announced jobs pathway guarantee program. These initiatives are delivering more opportunities than ever before for young people to participate in education and training which will, of course, lead to full-time employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out to the opposition that the training initiative and the Working Nation initiatives, which over a four-year period run into several billion dollars of expenditure, are aimed at improving particularly the opportunities for young people to get training and to get jobs through the subsidy schemes to employers. If you care to go and talk to a range of employers around Australia, like those of us in the government have been doing, you will find they are very well received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I would make to the opposition is: you consistently attack the Working Nation initiatives and the expenditure on providing this training.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start with the quote that Senator Harradine has correctly fed back to me. The point I was making is that, for example, the Western Australian government would argue that it is contributing to micro-economic reform by its labour market deregulation, yet we all know that the provocative nature of that labour market deregulation has in fact created anxiety for workers, led to industrial disputation, broken down Australia's industrial harmony, created bad figures on strikes per 1,000 employees in Australia and shaken business confidence in Australia. I do not believe that that is micro-economic reform. Nonetheless, some conservative governments trumpet around Australia that things that they do that follow their own ideological bent are micro-economic reform. They give micro-economic reform a bad name.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this government is concerned about&mdash;I think this comes close to what Senator Harradine was referring to&mdash;is the Hilmer report into competition policy. We and the states jointly sponsored that report. It finds that a range of initiatives should be taken at Commonwealth and state level to introduce competition to public sector monopolies in order that, through competition, the price of the service delivered by those public sector monopolies is reduced and efficiencies are found to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, this has to be seen in the context of the overall reform agenda of the Australian government. We have opened up the Australian economy and reduced tariff protection at a speed and in a way that has not burned off Australian industry&mdash;we have allowed it to face international competition and grow stronger&mdash;and we are now exporting many more manufactured goods, particularly higher value added manufactured goods, than ever before. That is a positive response to the opening up of the economy. But, if only the trade exposed sector of the economy bears the brunt of reform and you do not reform the non-trade exposed area of the economy, in the end Australia will lose its competitive edge and Australian companies in the trade exposed sector will be overwhelmed by international competition. Therefore, our thrust as government has been to push for opening up the economy, internationalising it through tariff change and the removal of non-tariff barriers, while at the same time engaging in a bold program of micro-economic reform. In this context I mean true reform and not the sorts of ideological things given the name of reform that some state governments wish to pursue. I would not describe as classic micro-economic reform what a number of state governments do; it is not aimed at finding greater efficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When efficiencies are found, input costs to business are cheaper, the level of competitiveness of those businesses grows, our share of the international economy grows and jobs are created in Australia. That is what I regard as reform. But, when you do a number of things simply for the sake of returning funds to your bottom line without necessarily improving efficiency, I do not regard that as reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other classics, and one that I have talked about in this chamber fairly frequently, is the decision of the South Australian government to outsource the state's water management facilities and not allow a single Australian company to bid for the management of that process.

This morning's AAP wire contained a story from Osaka based on the APEC customs symposium held there last week.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I can support very strongly those claims and that story. I acknowledge that last week the Chief Executive of Australian Customs, Lionel Woodward, was keynote speaker at the Osaka symposium. Australian Customs was the only APEC member customs administration asked to present a keynote address, which reflects the ongoing leadership Australian Customs has given in this area, going right back to 1993 when it was chair of the APEC customs procedures group. We have played a very significant leadership role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian Customs was a key player in the customs procedures subcommittee chaired by Japan this year and will maintain that level of support when the Philippines becomes the chair in 1996. The program put forward an ambitious and forward-looking nine-point action plan which includes specific deadlines and benchmarks which were agreed to earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nine-point action plan agreed to by APEC customs administrations covers a number of items. I will not go into them all, but they range from implementation of international conventions, such as the GATT valuation code and intellectual property rights by the year 2000, to revising an international harmonised system for tariff classification by 1998 and adherence to the UN/EDIFACT international electronic message standards by the year 1999. I know that they may sound rather boring and complicated names, but this is the real meat of what we are developing to encourage free trade in the APEC region&mdash;the harmonisation of customs procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These goals are not unrealistic and they indicate a common commitment by all APEC customs administrations to modernisation and harmonisation of procedures in order to facilitate free trade. Australian Customs has already agreed to implement this action plan and has achieved great progress in simplifying and modernising its procedures. At present in Australia 98 per cent of all cargo coming into and going out of the country is being processed electronically with no lessening of Customs' border protection obligations. The vast majority is immediately released on arrival with no further processing required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give the Senate another practical example. In discussions with Qantas and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs we have introduced the advanced passenger clearance process which will reduce by about half the time that passenger processing takes place at airports.

The decision to ground the Nomads a year ago was due to a particular mechanical problem that had to be rectified in Nomads throughout the world.

We hire a number of fixed-wing planes to do the job that military Nomads once did, and we will continue to do so. What I will do for you, though, is check to make sure that the method of using that particular civilian Nomad in no way trespassed the envelope in which they were required to fly.

<PARA>A 15 per cent across-the-board wage claim is being pursued by the building workers union and supported by the ACTU president, Jennie George. One can only deduce from Senator Cook's answer today that the government has abandoned, at least in the lead-up to the election, their position with regard to enterprise bargaining and productivity based increases as far as wages are concerned for the building industry. Apart from the metal trades unions, the building industry unions are the strongest in this country. They also have a record of taking industrial action to pursue their claims.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is in this section of the industry that the union enjoy a monopolistic control of the supply of labour. The degree of control varies from region to region and from time to time and notwithstanding the attempts by some state governments to mandate freedom of association. It is a fact that you don't work on any major projects in the major population centres without a union ticket.</PARA>
<PARA>Further in this speech he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CFMEU's latest claim was for a 25 per cent over award increase without any productivity offsets&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I underline `without any productivity offsets'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you are already paying 10 per cent over award then all you were up for was another 15 per cent over the following two years.</PARA>
<PARA>Today the minister, in handling his portfolio, had the opportunity to comment on Senator Parer's question that this claim would lead to increased inflationary pressures and the loss of 20,000 jobs on top&mdash;I underline `on top'&mdash;of the 80,000 it is predicted will be shed as a result of the collapse of the home building industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this claim and with what is occurring with the collapse of the home building industry, we are looking at a loss of some 100,000 jobs. Not only does it indicate a very significant change of position in terms of what the government is doing as far as its wages policy is concerned, but it also indicates a very significant change with the advent of Jennie George, following Martin Ferguson, as President of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that I want answered by the government is: is this an election ploy in the lead-up to the election or is this a fundamental change in their policy positions in terms of dealing with enterprise bargaining and productivity wage increases? When we look around Australia there is much evidence of companies that have moved on productivity based enterprise agreements and there have been significant improvements in the performance of those businesses and also the take-home pay of the employees. I particularly refer to some of the major mining operations in Western Australia. For example, Hamersley Iron increased productivity and has increased the take-home pay of the employees who work there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very backward step of the government in this particular case and in this particular answer from Senator Cook not to come out quite clearly and make the point that they did not support the position adopted by the building industry unions in this case and the President of the ACTU, Jennie George. One can only conclude that that major shift is an election ploy to placate to the masters who control this government when it comes to matters of this nature and will lead to a further loss of jobs, further breakdown in the housing industry and further breakdown in the commercial and industrial sectors of the building industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst aspect of the changed position is that it will flow, as do decisions involved in the metal trades industry, through other industries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested to note that Senator Murphy appears to be one of the leading intellectual lights of the union movement, because Senator Murphy, surprising though it may seem to honourable senators on this side of the House, is the first union official whom I have ever heard talk about the need to create jobs in industry. This is a concept which is lost on all of Senator Murphy's former colleagues in the union industry. It is lost on them because all they seem to be involved in is this endless, headlong pursuit of power for the ACTU.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about enterprise bargaining, my mind is brought back to a comment that was made by the National Party candidate for Capricornia, Mr Paul Marek, who is not only a former vice-president of the metalworkers union but a union member still. He basically said that the problem with much of the enterprise bargaining these days is caused not by the grassroots of the union movement&mdash;the shop committees&mdash;but by the ACTU coming in over the top and saying, `Irrespective of what you or your members want to do to create jobs, to create productivity and to create opportunities, we're not going to allow you to agree to anything&mdash;not one single thing&mdash;which might be contrary to some of the award conditions.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is most clearly borne out in what has happened at the AMH works in Rockhampton. In this dispute, the union on the shop floor had been prevailed upon by its members in the workplace to enter into an agreement with the company. What subsequently happened was that ACTU officials were sent up from Melbourne to tell the union members on the shop floor that they could not enter into this sort of agreement because it was contrary to the basic principles of the award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that we have a government which has imposed legislation which entrenches the power of monolithic union dinosaurs like the ACTU. That is the problem. Senator Murphy can come into the chamber&mdash;in all good conscience, I am sure&mdash;and say, `This government does not want to get involved in individual disputes,' and that is a very convenient thing for the government to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point is this: the government does not need to get involved in individual disputes on behalf of its client, the ACTU, because it has written the legislation in such a way as to give the ACTU enormous power&mdash;power to intervene in disputes, even though the people in the work place are quite happy to enter into an agreement with their employers. The real battle here is a battle to give the workers a say in their future. This is recognised by the workers, it is recognised by the people on the shop floor&mdash;and that is why the government is so terribly scared about the monster they have created. Ordinary workers are starting to understand that they are being overridden by the ACTU, by the powerbrokers in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation has arisen in which the government has had to say that there are these terrible bogeymen, called the opposition, who are going to kick workers. It says that we will hack into workers and that we will hack away at the safety net with a machete; we will punch workers and rip their rights away. The government is creating a bogeyman out there to justify the legislation, which it has created, which takes away from ordinary workers their rights to enter into an agreement of their choosing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is saying all of this to entrench the power of its mates in the union hierarchy of the ACTU. Mr Marek, the National Party candidate for Capricornia, has it absolutely spot on when he says the real problem is that the ACTU has become unrepresentative of the aspirations of ordinary workers, in the same way as their political representatives, the Labor Party, have lost sight of the aspirations of ordinary working men and women. </PARA>

However, I would first answer the interjection which was just made by Senator Murphy&mdash;a very lonely sight on the Labor side, along with Senators Kernot and Gareth Evans who are engaged in a private conversation. But other than Senator Evans, Senator Murphy is the only one left trying to defend Senator Cook. But on this side we have a good half dozen or more people. Of course, only one of us is needed against all of them, so it is very unfair for all of us to contribute to this debate against Senator Murphy.

If you have a look through the ranks of the Australian Labor Party, Senator Murphy is a classic example: former union hack or official I suppose would be more parliamentary. These people use the trade union movement to get onto the gravy train to get into parliament and try to enjoy themselves.

Whilst Senator Murphy might be parading around in this parliament saying he is concerned about the workers, their conditions, their wages and their lifestyle, what sort of wages will they be paid and what sort of lifestyle will they enjoy if they are denied the right to a job? Eight hundred thousand plus are currently denied a job because of Senator Murphy and the Labor government policies that have been inflicted upon this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleagues have said, particularly Senator Abetz, it is alarming that the government should let the opportunity go by to distance itself from an across the board wage claim being pursued by the Building Workers Union, which will have the result of seeing possibly tens of thousands of Australians, particularly young Australians, forced out of the labour market. This comes only days after it has been announced that the youth unemployment rate has actually risen by one per cent over the last quarter. It has gone up from 28.1 per cent at the time the Working Nation statement commenced to just over 29 per cent, which was the figure released last weak.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am alarmed at this because, having spoken to a number of young building workers in various parts of Australia over recent months and just recently in south-east Queensland&mdash;the home state of Senator Parer, who has contributed to this debate already&mdash;I know they are very, very scared about their futures. They just want to have a job&mdash;a well paid job, good working conditions and the protection that the industrial relations system can deliver them. But the main thing they are worried about is keeping their job. They are very scared, Senator Murphy, as you would know. I presume you talk to these people as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing Senator Cook said in response to the question during question time is that if you speak to the people in industry generally they are scared about our industrial relations system. I have to say that Senator Cook is talking to different people from those we are talking to. From discussions I have had with both small business people and large employers, the one thing they are most concerned about in industrial relations at the moment is the unfair dismissal provisions. They are very concerned about those provisions which are acting as a disincentive to business going out and employing people. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very big difference between the government and the coalition when it comes to the policy release agenda. At least in the time I have been in the party, we have made it our policy to release the details of the policy before the federal election day. The Keating Labor government makes it their policy to release the details after the election. That is one of the big differences between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition released all of its policies before the last election.

Born in Jerusalem in 1922, he was a man of great courage, great capacity, great tenacity, and of course great patriotism.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every event which has marked the history of Israel had Yitzhak Rabin at its core. Even as a young man after the war of 1948, he was involved in negotiations separating the forces, as well as having been involved in the fighting. He was a hero in every major event in Israel's survival thereafter. His life as a warrior, diplomat, politician and statesman was of a piece . . . Every step, every direction, he held before him a devotion to his nation, its survival, its health and the right of its citizens to live in peace.</PARA>
<PARA>Prime Minister Rabin's vision was for an Israel living free from conflict with its Arab neighbours. He well understood the force of that very wise statement by David Ben-Gurion back in the 1940s at the time of the foundation of Israel that the new country could be Jewish, it could be democratic and it could occupy the whole of the biblical land of Israel, but it could not be all three. Yitzhak Rabin recognised that peace on the principle of land for peace was the only way forward for Israel. He dedicated his political energies to advancing the peace process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his second term as Prime Minister from 1992, he did make an historic contribution&mdash;and it is now universally acknowledged&mdash;to the achievement of progress in the Middle East peace process, a contribution for which, with his colleague Shimon Peres and his negotiating partner, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, he was very appropriately awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under his leadership, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation reached agreement on a process for peace.

I do not think any of us will ever forget the original historic appearance at the White House on 13 September 1993 when he shook the hand of his former adversary, Yasser Arafat, in what was a deeply symbolic gesture of peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the pleasure of meeting Yitzhak Rabin on several occasions. While unquestionably a rather dour personality, I always found him quite engaging, not least because of the directness, the sincerity and the impressive commitment that just shone through him in his approach to the issues of the day. Perhaps the most revealing exchange I had with him was one that I have had occasion to recount publicly a couple of times in the last week, but I will do so again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was just in July this year that we had been talking about the current state of the Palestinian track of the peace process and, having just come from a meeting with Chairman Arafat in the Gaza, I was being so bold as to suggest that in a couple of specific respects Israel might perhaps find it possible to be a little more flexible in its negotiation.

You are preaching to the committed, not to the converted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a core, a residue, of absolute toughness about him, a determination to not let his heart rule his head in any way, shape or form but, at the same time, there was no doubt where his head was at. He was absolutely committed intellectually to the peace process and absolutely determined to make it work. That commitment was known, respected and indeed admired throughout the Middle East and also, I am sure, among some of the most hard-headed and hard-nosed of his opponents, or negotiating partners as it is perhaps preferable to call them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, when I had a conversation with President Assad just a couple of days after that one, and felt moved to retail this little exchange to President Assad, he was enormously amused by it, representing and conveying as it did so much of the essence of Yitzhak Rabin the leader, and President Assad recognising very much a fellow hard nose in the Middle East peace process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the approach he adopted to the peace process, combining commitment with caution and certainly investing all his enormously hard won reputation as a defence leader and soldier, it was Yitzhak Rabin more than anyone else who advanced that peace process. Accordingly, his assassination is an immeasurable loss for Israel, for the Middle East and indeed for the whole world. </PARA>

It was especially tragic in these circumstances that Yitzhak Rabin was killed, and killed by a fellow Jew, a fellow Israeli, because of his commitment to a peace process which was going to&mdash;and will, if it is carried through to fruition&mdash;ensure the safety and security of all Israelis better than any comparable approach to the country's security would ever be able to do. </PARA>

Our Prime Minister's presence was both to pay our respect to Mr Rabin's memory and our respect to his family. But it was also to demonstrate Australia's continuing commitment to the ongoing peace process which we all hope will be the true legacy of Mr Rabin to his country and to the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has long supported the right of Israel to a secure and peaceful existence among its Arab neighbours in the context of a comprehensive regional settlement. We have added to that position of principle a practical commitment of applying, to the extent that we reasonably can, Australian resources, skills and support in what is still a very vulnerable peace process.

We must overcome the sense of isolation that has held us in its thrall for almost half a century. We must join the international movement towards peace, reconciliation and cooperation that is spreading over the entire globe these days&mdash;lest we be the last to remain, all alone, in that station.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, Mr Rabin committed himself to that goal, and in the end he sacrificed his life to that objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we are remembering not only a man who was a national hero to his people but a man who will be remembered as an international hero. The assassination was obviously a tragic event along the path to peace, which has been a very difficult path in the Middle East. It demonstrates just how rocky the road to peace is. It is a tragic event for his family, for all Israelis, for all Jewish people and for all people internationally who wish to see peace and stability in the Middle East. He will be remembered by all those people&mdash;and I put myself within that category&mdash;as an international hero. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the symbolism that was attached to his funeral demonstrated the changing environment and the legacy of his contribution to that path towards peace. The fact that President Mubarak of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan would speak at his funeral and recommit themselves to that goal gives us confidence in the determination of many to ensure that his life was not given in vain. Similarly, I would associate with that the very moving comments of the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, at the time when Mr Rabin's death was announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even at the time of his funeral there were hopeful signs that the commitment Mr Rabin had given to the goal of peace would continue to be taken up by those with power and influence within the region. Additionally, the efforts in Israel that have flowed from the event of his assassination to root out intolerance and extremism, to ensure that a commitment to peace comes from within a state and not just between states, give us some hope that his work will be continued towards an ultimate positive end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not easy in a region such as the Middle East to put hatred behind after such long periods of conflict. It really does take great leadership to be able to break through the barriers towards that goal. Mr Rabin brought to the people of Israel a confidence in progressing the peace process. He demonstrated it with the courage he took into negotiations between Israel and adjoining states when he was previously Prime Minister, as well as on this last occasion and, more recently, in the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The confidence he had in himself and the confidence that the people had in him came from his record as a warrior and a defender of Israeli and Jewish interests. That enabled him to communicate to the people that it is possible to achieve a peace with security. That had always been the great hindrance along the path to peace&mdash;with every step forward, there was the concern within Israel that security might be jeopardised by that last step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Rabin had the confidence of his people to be able to take the message that peace with security could be achieved. His people could step forward with confidence. It was a remarkable life. I will not repeat the details, but we have merely to consider his military career, his period as chief of state, his diplomatic service, his political contribution as defence minister and twice as Prime Minister, and his recognition by the international community as a Nobel Prize winner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with sadness that we stand here today. Nevertheless, there is something moving about looking back upon a life that was so worth while in terms of not only his own people but the international community in general. I hope that Australia will honour the legacy of Mr Rabin by continuing to make a useful contribution towards the peace process in the Middle East. I was pleased to hear what Senator Evans said in that regard and I support his remarks. It is important that we, in our modest way, also demonstrate in a practical way that Mr Rabin has not given his life in vain. I take this opportunity to send the sincere sympathies of the coalition to Mr Rabin's wife and children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to associate members of the National Party of Australia with the condolence motion moved by the government. The assassination of the former Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, on 4 November shocked and saddened the world. It is an immense tragedy that the man who, after his election as Prime Minister in June 1992, the man who worked so hard to achieve peace in his region, should meet his untimely death at the hands of an Israeli extremist.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Born in Jerusalem in 1922 of Ukrainian parents who migrated to Palestine at the end of the First World War, Mr Rabin was for much of his life a career soldier. He undertook agricultural studies at workers' school but this was forgone as he embarked on his military career when he joined the Palmarch, an underground commando unit. Mr Rabin was a brigade commander during the Israeli war of independence in 1948. In 1963 he had risen to the most senior of military ranks when he became Israel's military chief of staff. Israel's victory in the six-day war against Egypt, Syria and Jordan was directly attributable to his military strategies and leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1968 Mr Rabin was appointed Ambassador to the United States. When Golda Meir resigned as Prime Minister in 1974 Mr Rabin obtained the nomination of the governing Labour Party and won the election that year. During his first term as Prime Minister he instigated interim military agreements with Syria and Egypt, the precursor towards the binding Middle Eastern peace agreements he was to later construct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1977 Mr Rabin was compelled to resign due to internal pressures, despite his successful authorisation of the commando raid that rescued 100 Israeli hostages from Entebbe airport the previous year. When he became Prime Minister for the second time in June 1992, at the age of 70, Mr Rabin was perfectly placed to lead his nation into the 21st century. He was a man whose formative life experiences were shaped by his military activities and a lifetime of working to build a securer Israel&mdash;yet at the same time was utterly committed to achieving peace in his region. In a speech to the Israeli parliament on 13 July 1992 Mr Rabin presented the vision of a peaceful Middle East:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last decade of the 20th century, walls of enmity have fallen, borders have disappeared, powers have crumbled, ideologies have collapsed.</PARA>

<PARA>During his prime ministership, the landmark agreement between Israel and Palestine for Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and the Gaza was hammered out. That was followed by a peace treaty with Jordan last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Rabin was a great man who was absolutely instrumental in laying down the path of peace in the Middle East. The fact that peace in the Middle East was breaking out was demonstrated by the presence of King Hussein of Jordan at Mr Rabin's funeral and by the fact that Yasser Arafat paid a private condolence call to Mrs Rabin. It is the hope of the world community that the peace plan implemented by Mr Rabin is now so embedded in the psyche of the people of the Middle East that, despite the cruel efforts of a few extremists, this peace plan will not be unravelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Rabin was the eighth Middle East leader to die at the hands of assassins in the past 20 years. Let there be no more.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats I wish to associate us with the condolence motion before the Senate today and to make a few brief remarks. Some years ago Yitzhak Rabin said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had the opportunity to belong to this generation of Jewish people, to whom divine history leaves the chance to be masters of their own destiny.</PARA>
<PARA>In the years since he made this comment, Yitzhak Rabin almost certainly exceeded his own expectations of what he meant by these remarks by contributing to the sorts of diplomatic achievements that few world leaders ever imagine that they will be a part of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">History will undoubtedly record that the leadership shown by Yitzhak Rabin was instrumental in securing the peace process in the Middle East. In reaching out to Israel's traditional enemies, and more particularly to the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Mr Yasser Arafat, Mr Rabin went much further than anyone might have imagined possible. His vision and commitment to the peace process were all the more remarkable given his own background as a former army general. Yet it was probably because of this background as a military man and the credibility he had built up over the years on security issues that Yitzhak Rabin was able to convince so many of his fellow Israelis to follow his government down the road to peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is true that we are all remembered by our last action, Yitzhak Rabin will be remembered as a peacemaker. His efforts towards this goal&mdash;efforts which were overwhelmingly recognised by the international community and resulted in the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize last year&mdash;and his endeavours towards peace were themselves nothing short of outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As others have said, the ultimate irony may be that, in giving his life, in his death he may well secure a lasting peace&mdash;but that is such an unnecessary price and probably very small comfort to his family. The onus now is for the rest of us to ensure that Yitzhak Rabin's efforts and tragic death were not in vain. The best way to ensure this, I think, is for the international community to do everything it can to ensure that a just and lasting peace is set in place in the Middle East and that this peace will survive any challenges that are thrown at it, including those that come from the extremist elements that unfortunately can fester in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in this regard, the Australian Democrats endorse the comments made both by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), who have on Australia's behalf expressed full support for a continuation of the peace process. There may be an opportunity for Australia to assist as Israel continues down the path to peace. We must consider all such requests if we are called upon to be involved or, if it is appropriate, for us to assist in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the week since Mr Rabin's tragic death so many words have been spoken and written about this great man. But I notice that others too have said that the words which moved us all were the words of his granddaughter. This remarkable young woman provided one of the most poignant impressions of the last few days when she delivered a very moving and intimate message to her grandfather&mdash;the grandfather she has just lost. Her message only sought to emphasise for me, and I am sure for most of us, the very personal impact which such tragedies have on the immediate family of leaders like Yitzhak Rabin who lead very public lives and who accept that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Vicki Bourne had the opportunity last week to represent the Democrats at the memorial service held in Sydney at the Great Synagogue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This unnecessary death, this terrible tragedy, leads us today to this motion of condolence, which I know, Mr President, you will pass on to the ambassador of Israel and so to the people and nation of Israel and the family of Prime Minister Rabin. I join with all that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) have said here this afternoon. In addition, I wish to make three particular references.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard most keenly the reference that the widow of Prime Minister Rabin made to the environment for extremism, which is made possible if there is less than full responsibility by each member of the community in any nation and by the members of the opposition. If the spectrum of rhetoric gives any room for an evil act, it makes that evil act more possible. I do not know how to evaluate the environment of the rhetoric that the opposition, Likud, has contributed in Israel. I only hear the words of the widow, Mrs Rabin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know from experience that it is possible to build an environment&mdash;whether it is one party or another, one minority or another, by their own actions, speeches, words, policies&mdash;which makes extremist actions an evil all the more viable, all the more possible. One of the messages that comes to me from this terrible act is that we in all nations should give no room for extremism or for violence. Even when an opposition may have criticism of a government policy, including the peace process, they should be circumspect about not giving room for extremism and for violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I wish to underline what is in this sad event a deterrent for extremists, for assassins. Let it be understood by any would-be assassin that in this event the consequence has been totally counterproductive to the attitude of the evil assassin. I judge there to be a single theme in the responses in the Senate today, in Australia, within Israel, amongst the Arab nations, in the UN, by the US President and by everyone who has responded: to therefore all the more reinforce the peace process and to ensure that the task and the goals to which Prime Minister Rabin was dedicated, including his last speech, be all the more assured, safeguarded and won. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only say realistically, after a week, that the assassin and anyone who has any support for that evil act can see that the action has been totally counterproductive. Let us hope that any extremists in any nation can pick up that message and realise that the fruits of violence are bitter and counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to refer to the peace process itself. Those senators who have visited my room&mdash;many of you have&mdash;particularly in the year following 25 September 1993, will have noticed that there was a photograph of Prime Minister Rabin, Chairman Arafat and President Clinton in the famous handshake which marked the conclusion of the peace process. Senators know that I have been involved through all my years in the Senate in foreign affairs matters. I regarded the end of the Cold War as one of the great victories of my time in this place. It has been contributed to from all over the world. The other great victory was this five-year peace process being launched by that famous handshake. All of us in this chamber metaphorically stood around Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat as they came together in this creative and unique way, a way that we welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not have the opportunity to meet former Prime Minister Rabin, but I did meet Chairman Arafat in the month after that handshake in the first discussions that Australian parliamentarians had been able to have with him. That was in Tunisia. In that month I was able to visit Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon and listen carefully so that we in the Australian parliament could respond as positively as possible in reinforcing the peace process. Since then I have always stood ready to visit Israel&mdash;a place which I have visited in the past and which I as one Australian parliamentarian would also want to encourage all the more in that peace process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens (WA) wish to join in supporting this motion today. The enormously difficult peace process in the Middle East is evidence that it is more than the absence of war. In speaking today, I wish to mention some quotes from Prime Minister Rabin in his own growing realisation of this fact. In the early 1990s Prime Minister Rabin became convinced that it was time for Israel to try in earnest to conclude a political settlement with its increasingly discontented Palestinian population and its Arab neighbours. This was in response to what was seen by many people as a world break-out of peace in areas which would never conceivably happen at the end of the Cold War. Prime Minister Rabin said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last decade of the twentieth century, the atlases, history and geography books no longer present an up-to-date picture of the world. Walls of enmity have fallen, borders have disappeared. Powers have crumbled and ideologies collapsed, states have been born, states have died, and the gates of emigration have been flung open.</PARA>
<PARA>It was seen to be a concern that Israel not be left behind with the changing international climate. There are many facets to security which cannot be secured by guns or bombs. Ironically, as has been mentioned today, it was because of the trust that Yitzhak Rabin had gained in trying to defend Israel militarily that his people allowed him to explore non-military options towards peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yitzhak Rabin was very aware of the need for an integrated approach to peace which realised that the mistrust and insecurity of neighbouring countries must be addressed at its source&mdash;the desire for a homeland, for an economic base, for self-determination and, of course, for peace. Unfortunately, it is all too easy for the peace between countries to be replaced by conflict within countries, especially as the new internationalism may help to accentuate the gap between rich and poor and associated differences in access to resources. Yitzhak Rabin's own statements in November 1993 recognise that there were many elements in creating peace. He recognised that there was a real need for self-determination in Palestine. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For many years I served as a soldier. I believe that as a soldier I've seen not only victories of the armies, I've also seen the sufferings of the peoples of the countries in the region. And I believe that the time has arrived for the peoples and the leaders to find ways to change their way of thinking.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want the Palestinians to run the lives of the Palestinians in the territories. We would like to see a council, a self-governing authority, established in accordance to the DOP, by elections, and chosen by the Palestinians themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Rabin acknowledged the obstacles and the opposition to what he was doing. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are forces that oppose the agreement in both the PLO and its leadership for signing the agreement as we in Israel have people who oppose the government and my decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>What he was doing was a very brave thing to do. The legacy of all peacemakers is to work towards building real security, an absence of fear, an equitable society which recognises that desperation can lead to desperate measures. I ask today that we should all work as peacemakers in our own region&mdash;to recognise the need for real and lasting security and, as Prime Minister Rabin has done, to build peace and maintain it as a precious gift.

His political life stretched over more than 20 years as a member of the Knesset.

He capped a distinguished career as a peacemaker, in terms of the recognition of it, with the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994. That was seen throughout the world as recognition which was extremely well deserved. He worked for many years to achieve peace in the Middle East, to bring a closer relationship and understanding between Israel and its Middle East neighbours. Very importantly, it was his efforts and that of others&mdash;Yasser Arafat and his colleague Shimon Peres&mdash;that led to the 1993 accord with the PLO on Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank. That was followed by a long series of negotiations with other Israeli neighbours, culminating in the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan just 12 months ago, in October 1994. Since then, there have been further developments along the path of the peace process. There is still a long way to go.

What struck me, when I listened to the reports coming out of Israel and the comments, particularly of Yitzhak Rabin's family, was not only the tremendous suffering but also the enormous courage that is involved in the struggle for peace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to associate myself with the remarks that have been made by both the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) and the leader of the coalition, Senator Hill. The tragic assassination last week of Prime Minister Rabin brought back some very vivid memories for me. I, like Senator Baume, spent some time in Israel in 1965, which was only a short time after Senator Baume's visit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, too, remember the state of Israel. Israel was just a fledgling state at that stage; it had been 17 years since the state had been in existence. It was a state which was still trying to consolidate its position in the area; a state which had no social intercourse with any of its neighbours&mdash;the only way of getting into Israel was, as Senator Baume mentioned, through the Mandelbaum Gate crossing no-man's-land, which I remember vividly as well. It was a young nation of people made up mainly of immigrants from other countries who were trying to establish themselves as a state in the area and as a state where they felt some sort of security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prime Minister Rabin had an outstanding military career. Remember that the Israel I know was the Israel prior to the 1967 conflict, the 1973 conflict and all of the other conflicts that Israel found itself facing over the 30 years that have passed since my time there. Prime Minister Rabin had an outstanding military career in this period. It must be remembered that at the end of that outstanding military career he probably fought his hardest fight&mdash;the fight for peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In military engagements you know who your enemies are; when you are fighting for peace they are sometimes very hard to identify. The fact that on this particular occasion the assassin was someone from within Prime Minister Rabin's own country means that it was one of those opponents who are impossible to identify. In his fight for peace, he has done more for Israel probably then he ever did as a military commander, even though I guess during those days it was a case of establishing their boundaries and consolidating their place as a state in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, in that fight for peace the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin will be remembered as someone who sacrificed his life in the service of his country. We can only hope that his endeavours in the field of peace will be remembered by all those who seek to achieve those aims. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like all other members of the Senate, I wish to endorse the remarks of all senators in support of this motion. Last week I had the opportunity in my office late on Tuesday evening to watch live the funeral ceremony from Israel. No-one who watched that could have been other than completely moved by the remarks made by such an extraordinary range of political leaders. But without doubt the most moving speech, and one of the most moving I have ever heard, was by his granddaughter, who spoke so eloquently and movingly of a personal memory of her grandfather. I think that said more to any of those watching than all the other excellent remarks made by all those political leaders.</PARA></TALK.START>

He then became the leader for the peace movement and the establishment of the dialogue and now, what we all hope for, a permanent settlement with the Palestinian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that, in any terms of history, very few people in any country will play such a role as Prime Minister Rabin played in his country through his whole life.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this motion and at the outset offer my condolences to the family of Yitzhak Rabin, and particularly to the people in the state of Israel and the members of the Jewish community in Australia. I came across a quote the other day in relation to this matter which I thought was rather interesting. It is entitled `Soldier of peace'. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The soldier lived to become a man of peace, yet the man of peace met the death of a soldier, his body torn by bullets. Perhaps there is no contradiction in the first part of the statement, only a paradox. We justify war by saying that it begets peace, that through death we bring life, and so on. By this logic, the Yitzhak Rabin who led Israel's army to triumph in the Six Day War shares everything but tactics with the Yitzhak Rabin who shook the hand of Yasser Arafat on the White House lawn. The warrior and the conciliator formed two  sides of the same soul, seeking one result.</PARA>
<PARA>And so it was that on the weekend, at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, we remembered the sacrifices made by people who fought for this country in the endeavour to find peace. I believe that one can draw a comparison with that when one looks at the life of Yitzhak Rabin. Not only was he involved in fighting for his country in the 1940s and in the Arab-Israeli war in 1948 and in the Six-Day War, in which he played such a crucial role, but also he was involved in securing the state of Israel's security in the years after that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, he himself stated that the time had come to stop war, to stop the bloodshed and to endeavour to resolve the matter. In fact, in the same speech Senator Short quoted from&mdash;it was to be his last speech, to 100,000 or so people gathered for a peace rally&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we once took up our role in war, we must now work to find a solution to the most complex issue of the Israeli-Arab conflict, the Israeli-Palestinians conflict. It is not easy, it is painful, but there is no alternative.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, it takes great men&mdash;and there are very few of them&mdash;like Yitzhak Rabin to realise when there has been too much war, when there has been too much bloodshed, and when the time has come for the killing to stop. Unfortunately, as frail human beings we seem to have a history of going through a cycle of war and killing and then peace. It seems to be a never-ending cycle in the history of man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But always at the crossroads there are remarkable men like Yitzhak Rabin who say to their fellow human beings, `Enough is enough. There is no alternative. We must now seek peace. The end to all this killing has come.' But, of course, usually in such cases those people pay the ultimate price. One has only to look through history to see where great men and women have paid the ultimate price. So it was that he paid the ultimate price after that speech to that peace rally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have to reflect on the times we now face, which are very different to the times Yitzhak Rabin faced in the 1960s, 1970s and perhaps the early 1980s. We do have a very different world today. We have a world without a Berlin Wall, we have a world where eastern Europe has changed dramatically and we even have a situation where there are endeavours for peace in Ireland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So hopefully the time has come when we are entering into a new era of peace in this world although, unfortunately, that does not exist in Bosnia. I think it is incumbent on us as leaders of our country to endeavour to keep the fight for peace going. I think Yitzhak Rabin's contribution in this regard should be upheld and maintained and perhaps his death used as a marker for good. Perhaps we can use that as a rallying point, a focal point, to keep alive the peace prospects in the Middle East and, more importantly, the endeavours for peace worldwide. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I visited Israel in April this year as a guest of the Knesset and, together with the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, hosted a dinner for Prime Minister Rabin at the famous King David Hotel in Jerusalem. Also, because I was sitting next to her, I had a very long discussion with the Prime Minister's wife, Leah, and I must say I was impressed with her knowledge of Australia, with her very deep knowledge of Australian art and with her fondness for Australia&mdash;particularly for the city of Melbourne, but for Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found both of them to be extremely engaging people. Mr Rabin was, above all, a realist who had seen the limits of what could be gained from war and knew that, if there were to be any lasting peace, real changes would have to be made. His land for peace policies were based on pragmatic confidence building measures designed to lock Palestinians into ever increasing responsibilities for the peace process. He could do this because the majority of Israelis knew him to be tough in ensuring their own security yet willing to try a new path to peace. He had seen how the intifada had broadened the scope of the conflict and how the policies of the past had alarmed even those close friends of Israel. He was aware of the risks from those who believed might would always be right. But he did not waiver in his determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it must have been extremely hurtful to him to have been called a Nazi by some Jews, knowing how offensive that association is to all Jews. Yet he carried on. As others have already said, I can only hope that his untimely death continues to unify the people of Israel and that they press ahead with the peace program. As has already been alluded to, polls yesterday showed that the vast majority of Israelis want this to happen. It would be a fitting tribute if his death were a catalyst in some sort of existentialist way, if that is not in conflict with Judaism, for real peace in the Middle East. </PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC INTEREST WHISTLEBLOWING</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Ministerial Statement</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing was established by resolution of the Senate on 2 September 1993. On 27 October 1993 the Senate referred to the committee for inquiry and report the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1993, a private senator's bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee received 125 submissions and 12 supplementary submissions, in addition to a number of written responses to evidence and submissions. It took oral evidence at public hearings over 7 hearing days in November 1993 and January and March in 1994. The report of the committee was tabled in the Senate on 30 August 1994. An interim government response was tabled on 29 November 1994. The interim response stated that the government would endeavour to present a comprehensive response in February 1995. However, the government response was deferred to await the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the protection of confidential and third party information, the report of the commission of inquiry into the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the government response to the public service act review group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to express my thanks to the committee for its efforts. The subject of whistleblowing has been increasingly an issue on the national agenda. It is likely that the committee's report signifies the beginning of a new attitude to the general subject of whistleblowing. That state of affairs is consistent with the now well established philosophy of this government to develop modern, responsible managerial practices in public administration, which serve as a guide to the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has decided to give `in principle' approval to the development of whistleblower legislation that will strengthen the position of public spirited citizens within our modern managerial framework. First, however, I will shortly outline to you several matters which are relevant to whistleblowing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed that there are two reports which have a direct bearing on both the protection and disclosure of information and public service administration: The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report on the protection of confidential and third party information and the report of the Public Service Act review group. These reports raise issues of direct relevance to any proposed whistleblowing scheme, and it is appropriate to consider the detail of a whistleblowing scheme in the light of the recommendations contained within these reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that the public report of the commission of inquiry into the Australian secret intelligence service supported the Gibbs committee's recommendations on the protection of whistleblowers. The government considers whistleblowing legislation to be an integral part of its response to the recommendations of the Samuels commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the guidelines on official conduct of Commonwealth public servants, a revised edition of which was issued in march 1995, have been amended to explain how a disclosure of information can be made under existing laws and the protection that is currently available to whistleblowers. It should also be noted that the financial management and accountability bill will give responsibility to managers for identifying and responding to instances of maladministration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek leave to table the government's response to the committee's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While that response indicates the government's proposed course of action on the issue of whistleblowing, I believe a short statement to explain the government's proposed whistleblowing scheme is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government understands the term whistleblowing to refer to the disclosure, in the public interest, of information which indicates wrongdoing. The public interest is in the fair and independent investigation of such allegations of wrongdoing, and the protection of a whistleblower from recrimination in the course of his or her employment following his or her disclosure of information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government intends to introduce into parliament legislation for the protection of whistleblowers and the investigation of their allegations. In the Commonwealth sphere whistleblowing is hindered by provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 prohibiting the disclosure of official information. In December 1991 the Gibbs committee, in its review of Commonwealth criminal law, made certain recommendations for the reform of the laws on the disclosure of official information. The public report of the commission of inquiry into the Australian Security Intelligence Service also recommended the introduction of whistleblowing legislation. It will be appropriate to introduce laws on whistleblowing both as a part of the government's implementation of the Gibbs committee's recommendations and as part of the government's response to the recommendations of the Samuels committee's inquiry into ASIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme will be based upon a two stage process: whistleblowing disclosure within a department or agency, then to an independent agency. This process is identical to the basis of the committee's proposed scheme, and parallels arrangements that have been successful in other contexts, such as police complaints. The legislation will apply to Commonwealth officers and contractors. It will encourage them to use internal reporting mechanisms in the first instance in the form of an officer authorised to receive whistleblowing disclosures. The legislation will also provide for the use of existing independent reporting agencies&mdash;the Ombudsman and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (the IGIS)&mdash;to ensure that disclosures are received and investigated. The government anticipates that access to the MPRA will ensure that whistleblowers who are Commonwealth officers are protected from retaliation in the course of their employment. Government contractors and their employees will receive similar protection from recrimination by Commonwealth officers through the ombudsman or the IGIS, as appropriate. Consequential amendments will be made to the relevant legislation to ensure that these independent agencies have the jurisdiction and powers appropriate to ensuring that the objectives of the proposed whistleblowing scheme are achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee emphasised that potential whistleblowers need to be reassured that their disclosures will be fully and properly investigated by an appropriate independent agency that is accountable for its activities. The Ombudsman will be required to oversee the operation of the whistleblowing scheme and prepare information for inclusion in his or her annual report. The IGIS will oversee the operation of the whistleblowing scheme in the intelligence and security agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government proposes that an authorised officer, who represents the internal reporting mechanism, will be required to notify the Ombudsman of receipt of the whistleblower's complaint. The Ombudsman will have certain discretionary powers which may be exercised over the authorised officer's investigation of the disclosure. The authorised officer's decision to investigate the matter or not, to refer the matter to the Ombudsman or IGIS for investigation, or the result of the investigation, will be communicated to the whistleblower. If the whistleblower is dissatisfied with the authorised officer's decision not to investigate or with the result of the investigation, the whistleblower may take the matter to the Ombudsman or IGIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ombudsman or IGIS will have a range of powers to investigate a whistleblower's allegations, including the power to refuse to do so. They will also have the power to refer the matter to any other appropriate agency, such as the Auditor-General or the Privacy Commissioner, to be dealt with as that agency sees fit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not consider it appropriate for a whistleblower to make public disclosures either before using the whistleblowing scheme or before a final determination has been made on the allegations. Whistleblowing allegations are serious matters requiring careful investigation. The information available to a whistleblower may not be complete. Nor is the whistleblower usually in a position to make an independent assessment of the public interest considerations. The Ombudsman and the IGIS, on the other hand, are disinterested third parties who have powers and expertise to conduct full investigations, to assess the allegations in their full context and to make judgements about the action required. Both the Ombudsman and the IGIS have the public interest as their primary concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public interest in creating a whistleblowing scheme is in the fair and independent investigation of allegations made by whistleblowers. Public disclosures may impair any investigation into the allegation. Whistleblowers who publicly disclose material after an investigation is complete will need to ensure that any such disclosure does not breach existing secrecy and privacy laws or the limits of their authorisation to disclose information. The Ombudsman will have a discretion to make public statements about whistleblowing matters as is appropriate. The Ombudsman will also include information about whistleblowing in his or her annual report. Existing powers to make special reports to the Prime Minister or parliament by the Ombudsman or the MPRA will apply to whistleblowing matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has given detailed consideration to all of the committee's recommendations and acknowledges the substantial assistance it has obtained from the committee's report in formulating the first scheme for the protection of whistleblowers and the investigation of their allegations at the Commonwealth level.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Price</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the attachment to this letter we set out the Government's Response to your Committee's Report entitled "Australia's Participation in Peace Keeping", which was tabled in Parliament on 8 December last year. In doing so, we wish to make a number of general points on behalf of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government finds the Report to be a useful document which focuses public attention on the increasing importance and complexity of peace keeping operations. The Report also draws attention to Australia's increased participation in peace keeping, and the multi-dimensional nature of that participation. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) has contributed in varying ways to more than 20 of the 33 United Nations peace keeping operations undertaken since World War II. The ADF has demonstrated a high degree of adaptability in being able to provide individuals, groups of specialists and formed military units for the complex political and military operations which epitomise contemporary multi dimensional peace keeping. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) has also had a long history of involvement in the law and order aspects of peace keeping operations, but as the United Nations operations in Cambodia, Mozambique and Haiti indicate, the AFP has acquired much broader responsibilities such as investigating human rights violations, training local police officers to rebuild or create the local police force, verifications of local elections and a range of humanitarian tasks. As the nature of peace operations has expanded, so too has the need for the services of other non-military Government agencies, such as the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). The AEC's involvement in providing international electoral assistance within the context of United Nations peace keeping operations began in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group for Namibia (UNTAG) in late 1989 and continued in the Western Sahara, Cambodia and Mozambique.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The multidimensional nature of Australia's participation in peace keeping operations was demonstrated in the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) in which the ADF, the AFP and the AEC all made significant contributions. In the current international environment, it seems likely that the specialist capabilities and experience of Australian military and civilian agencies will continue to be keenly sought after in peace operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, we are particularly encouraged by the fact that the Committee's Report generally endorses the Government's approach to multinational peace keeping operations and its efforts to make constructive contributions to the process of improving United Nations peace keeping.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last few years, the increasing number of highly ambitious United Nations operations have clearly tested the ability of the international community to respond to crises which in turn has highlighted the need to reconsider the way we conduct peace operations. Many of the recommendations made by your Committee correspond to reforms of processes and resource allocations which have recently begun to be addressed by the United Nations and are being pursued by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inevitably, the expansion of United Nations peace keeping operations has increased the level of risk to the safety of United Nations personnel. In this context, one particularly important reform in which the Government has been actively involved, is the establishment of an international legal regime to protect United Nations personnel. Australia negotiated and co-sponsored the "Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel", adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1994. The Government is currently working to ensure early adherence to the Convention through signature and ratification in order to send a clear message that the international community will not tolerate attacks on United Nations personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has also made a substantial contribution to a number of informal groups dedicated to reforming peace keeping operations including three working groups established after the Ottawa Conference in April 1994, which dealt with the political direction and support of peace keeping operations, command and control issues, and training. Another positive development in the international effort to strengthen United Nations peace keeping was a Presidential Statement by the United Nations Security Council which announced that measures would be put in place to enhance consultation arrangements between the Security Council, the United Nations Secretariat and troop-contributing nations. Australia has also contributed to the debate on improving the UN's rapid deployment capability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is continuing to consider ways of improving certain aspects of Australia's participation in peace keeping operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We thank you and the members of your Committee for this Report.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Evans, launched his book, "Cooperating For Peace" at the forty eighth United Nations General Assembly, one of its key aims was to develop an agreed vocabulary for the range of possible responses to international security problems. Significant progress has been made in this respect but a degree of confusion regarding terminology still persists and as United Nations peace operations continue to increase in number and complexity, the need to clarify this confusion has never been greater. "Cooperating for Peace" has provided a useful basis for agreed terminology within the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Common terminology is also addressed in a number of documents produced by the Australian Defence Force Peacekeeping Centre. This terminology is largely in accordance with current United Nations practice which in turn now largely coincides with the "Cooperating for Peace" terminology. The Government will continue to develop agreed national terminology and draw on the doctrinal assets of the Australian Defence Force Peacekeeping Centre.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed in Principle</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Comment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years, United Nations peace keeping operations have become increasingly multidimensional and have included a wide range of civilian functions such as civilian policing, electoral assistance, civil administration, public information, human rights monitoring, refugee repatriation and humanitarian assistance. The level of involvement of Australians, both from relevant Government agencies and private individuals, has been increasing throughout this period and there is scope, in terms of expertise and experience, to further that level of involvement. The Government is currently pursuing a strategy to place Australian nationals in key positions throughout the United Nations system, including agencies involved in United Nations peace keeping operations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government give serious consideration to the likely prospects for ongoing peace and stability before committing Australian personnel to peace keeping. (para 2.24)</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Comment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extent of commitment of the warring parties to the operation is one of the key criteria examined in the planning process. It is difficult, however, to predict with any certainty whether peace and stability will or will not follow the commencement of any peace operation. There are obvious risks associated with any peace operation and these are factors which have to be fully considered before commitment of Australian personnel. Where such risks are involved, plans are made for the withdrawal of the Australian contingent in an emergency.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two priority tasks of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade included in the Department's 1994-96 Corporate Plan, demonstrate the Government's commitment to focusing the international community on preventive strategies and peace building. These are enhancing the regional security environment based on acceptance of cooperative security approaches, and strengthening the effectiveness of the United Nations in cooperative security arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end, Australia has drafted a resolution on "Peace Building and Preventive Diplomacy" and is working to have it adopted by the United Nations General Assembly this year. Preventive approaches are also being pursued regionally through the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) where a paper was presented to an ARF Intersessional Seminar on preventive diplomacy in Seoul in May 1995</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia currently provides seven military officers to United Nations Headquarters (UNHQ), New York, in the Department of Peace Keeping Operations (DPKO), filling a number of key staff appointments in the operations, planning and logistics fields. These postings are seen as a valuable contribution to the enhanced efficiency of the DPKO and to the development of its peace keeping operations doctrine. This number is disproportionately high in relation to our total peace operation contribution, reflecting the United Nations' considerable regard for the quality of Australian Defence Force personnel. However, Australia is not regarded as a major or medium level contributor to peace operations and cannot be expected to be given a leading reformist's role while that is the case. Australia will continue to consider requests to provide staff to UNHQ on a case by case basis.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia continues to actively encourage United Nations to reform its command and control of peace keeping operations especially in developing better mechanisms for providing strategic military advice to the Security Council. The Government is receptive to proposals from Member States, such as the current Canadian Study for improving the United Nations' rapid reaction capability, to increase overall effectiveness. It should be noted that there have been a number of organisational changes in the Secretariat and recent structural changes in DPKO which will, when fully implemented, bring about some of the integration proposed in the recommendation. A Situation Centre has been established within DPKO, manned by military and civilian officers, and is responsible for the day to day monitoring of United Nations operations. This centre provides daily reports on each United Nations mission to Permanent Missions in New York. The Australian Defence Force has an officer posted to this centre. The location of dedicated Mission Liaison officers within the Situation Centre would, in practice, prove inefficient and would duplicate existing lines of communication between Force Commanders and military and political officers in the United Nations in New York.</PARA>

Our participation in peace operations in Cambodia provided a constructive basis to increase cooperation with regional countries. We are making opportunities available to regional countries to undertake peace operations training with Australia, primarily through encouraging regional attendance at the Australian Defence Force Peacekeeping Centre, and are seeking ways of expanding this type of cooperative activity, including through regional discussions such as the ARF. By developing closer cooperation in peace operations with regional countries, we build confidence and contribute to cooperative regional security arrangements. For Australia to continue to play a leading role, we will need to retain both the perception that we are committed to supporting peace operations, and the knowledge and standing flowing from first-hand experience of these operations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises the multi-dimensional nature of peace keeping operations and already takes an integrated approach to the training and preparation of all civilian and military personnel for deployment in peace keeping operations. The academic study of peace keeping is already well covered by Australian academic institutions. The Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence currently provide significant funds to four academic institutions, which support research and publications on peace keeping. The Australian Defence Force Peacekeeping Centre at Williamtown provides training for multidimensional peace keeping operations, primarily for the Australian Defence Force, and is responsible for the development of the essential doctrine for the Australian Defence Force's involvement in peace keeping operations. The Centre also seeks to include other relevant Government Departments and NGOs in its training courses and development of doctrine. The Centre also provides training opportunities for regional countries, which is a concrete example of regional security cooperation. Although there may be scope to further develop the multi-dimensional and inter-disciplinary approaches taken by the Centre, the arguments in favour of a new institution and the issue of its location within Australian Defence Studies Centre have not been adequately substantiated, and the Government considers that a feasibility study is not warranted at this stage.</PARA>

Priority goals for 1995 have been the promotion of Australia's preventive diplomacy draft resolution and progress towards establishing a more representative Security Council. Australia worked in the annual session in April of the UN Special Committee on Peace Keeping Operations to bring greater clarity in defining the objectives and mandates of United Nations operations, and to strengthen the United Nations' capacity to plan operations. Australia also circulated amongst Special Committee members the conclusions of the April Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) seminar on the use of force in peace operations and contributed to the debate on improving the United Nation's rapid deployment capacity. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade presented a paper on the division of labour between the United Nations and regional organisations for a major international conference at La Trobe University in July and is also working on a joint paper with the Dutch on improving the effectiveness of sanctions regimes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(b) Identifying means of "re-integrating" United Nations activities and enhancing system-wide co-ordination, including by developing proposals in the Agenda for Development Working Group to further enhance the Economic and Social Council's role in system-wide co-ordination as well as through suggesting better arrangements for humanitarian relief operations. </EMPHASIS>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been identifying concrete ways of promoting a more coordinated and integrated approach to the work of United Nations bodies including program effectiveness and limiting duplication, including at the Economic and Social Council and in major United Nations meetings. The Department's specific proposals in the economic and social areas include implementing measures to monitor the performance of the machinery for United Nations humanitarian relief coordination, promoting the Beijing Women's Conference as a "conference of commitments", efforts to strengthen the human rights treaty system, pressing for the collocation of secretariats of various environment conventions in Geneva and our efforts to streamline the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific's annual sessions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(c) Pursuing increased administrative efficiency and program focus in the specialised agencies and greater responsiveness to member states' needs</EMPHASIS>, by continuing to pursue improved budget, financial and program management and to promote the extension of worthwhile reforms across the United Nations system such as the management reforms introduced in the Secretariat in New York. Australia will continue to participate in multi-donor agency evaluations such as that for the United Nations Children's Fund and Rwanda and maintain Australia's leading role in the World Health Organisation and reforms of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(d) Addressing the United Nation's financial problems and working to match allocation of resources to evolving priorities</EMPHASIS>, in the United Nations itself and across the United Nations system.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS>Australia is assessing how to pursue its proposals for improving peace keeping financing procedures; which were partly adopted by the United Nations Fifth Committee in December 1994, although the greater focus this year is likely to be on reviewing the scale of assessments for peace keeping payments. Australia will remain a leading advocate of introducing incentives to promote prompt payment of regular budget and peace keeping payments, and will be participating in efforts through the Geneva Group to identify areas for savings in United Nations programs that can be redeployed into priority areas. The United Nations mission in New York plans to develop proposals for the review of the major United Nations financial oversight bodies as a Canada Australia and New Zealand (CANZ) group exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(e) Creating more competent United Nations secretariats, including support for the introduction of modern management practices and greater accountability. </EMPHASIS>Australia will develop further the case for top-level restructuring to introduce four Deputy Secretaries-General and build on the work of our United Nations General Assembly 49 delegation which co-ordinated the key resolution giving Member States' backing to personnel reforms.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Cooney</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing in response to your Committee's report, tabled on 21 September 1995, on the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government appreciates the work the Committee has done reviewing the Bill and providing recommendations to improve its clarity and efficacy. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's response to the recommendations made by the majority of the Committee follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendations 1 and 2:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That clauses 6, 8 and 9 of the Bill be amended to reflect the discrimination against the aggrieved person as a member of a group, rather than as an individual, in accord with the principle suggested by Ms Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That consequential amendments should be made to clause 10.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As stated by officers of my Department in public hearings before the Committee, it was always intended that the new test for indirect discrimination, proposed in clauses 6, 8 and 9 of the Bill, would recognise that the "group element" is a central aspect of any definition of indirect discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in order to reduce any confusion and make absolutely clear what is intended, the Government accepts the majority's recommendation and will redraft the relevant clauses by way of Government amendments this session, in accordance with this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any necessary consequential amendments will be made to clause 10 of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That clause 10 should be amended to make clear that the proposed section 7D refers to equality of outcomes, provided that this can be achieved without causing undue delay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Committee recognises, the proposed section 7D aims to protect measures that have, as one of their purposes, the aim of achieving "substantive equality". It always has been the Government's intention that section 7D refer to real or substantive equality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agree that the provision may not make this point as clearly as possible. The Government will therefore move an amendment to Clause 10 to clarify what is intended by inserting "substantive" before "equality" in section 7D. As noted by Ms Morgan (Submission No 18), "substantive equality" is synonymous with the idea of "equality of outcomes", but the Government's preference is to amend the provision to refer to substantive equality. This is more in keeping with the intended focus on achieving real equality.</PARA>

What they cannot follow, I am happy to give to them, because I am reading precisely from a transcript. I will continue:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No such ground has ever been ventured in respect to any member of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, never mind a senior Federal Senator, a past State President and a life member of State Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The State Executive motion asking me to resign gave no ground, justification or reason.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was refused a right to attend that State Executive and to be heard. The resignation resolution by the State President to State Executive was based on different grounds to the expulsion motion. No grounds could or did justify the resignation motion. The expulsion motion was moved because quite naturally I would not simply bend to the misinformed, improper and biased call to resign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Presidents motives in moving the resignation and expulsion motions had nothing to do with the grounds, but were in part, the result of a deal he entered into with a small but threatening group of organisational and parliamentary members. Euphemistically called, on some occasions, "the peace plan".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The State President has deliberately ignored the debilitating, disruptive and destructive conduct and comments of a number of party members including senior office bearers and Members of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One ground relates to the improper obtaining of private information and its improper distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect to the restraining order, subsequent to its public disclosure, both the State President and the Premier have condemned its publication and stated frequently it should not and does not impinge upon my role or contribution as a Liberal Senator and both subsequently offered me publicly their full support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Market research shows that the matter has had no impact whatsoever on voter intentions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The action undertaken in respect to me is a gulf of difference between that of other contemporary Members of Parliament and the historic response to grave conduct by organisational and Parliamentary members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The grounds contrived against me bear absolutely no comparison with examples which I have given.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process undertaken by State Executive was based on an adversarial nature rather than one of ensuring proper and full opportunities for the matter to dealt with in a fair and conciliatory way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My counsel and myself were invited to attend the State Executive, present our case and to answer a number of questions, but we were not entitled to ask questions, we were not able to rebut assertions made against me and nor were we able to rebut comments made in respect to our submission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public and private statements by the State President and other State Executive members prior to the State Executive meeting should have led to the disqualification of those from the hearing. However not withstanding a request from Malcolm McCusker QC that they disqualify themselves, they refused and participated in the deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. RESTRAINING ORDER</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The clauses of the State Executive resolution headed RESTRAINING ORDER AND PARTY LEADER are in breach of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 which codifies article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688[9].</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The immunity of parliamentary proceedings from impeachment or question in courts or other tribunals depends ultimately on article 9 of the Bill of Rights of 1688 [9], which is part of the law applying to the Australian Houses by virtue of section 49 of the Constitution. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Article 9 provided that "the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament".</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 codifies the interpretation of article 9 in its application to the Australian Houses. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The section provides that evidence of parliamentary proceedings cannot be used in any court or tribunal in any way contrary to article 9 or the section.</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> The prohibited use of evidence of parliamentary proceedings is defined to include any use of those proceedings against any person in a wide sense.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Act provides a wide definition of "impeached or questioned", it does not exhaust the meaning of that phrase, and the definition of "tribunal" does not exhaust the category of bodies before which parliamentary proceedings must not be impeached or questioned. This is because section 16 provides that article 9 has the effect of the provisions of the section "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">in addition to any other operation</EMPHASIS>".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question is determined by the nature of the body, to its proceedings and of the detriment imposed on the member. The court would distinguish between mere withdrawal of political support, which obviously would not be unlawful, from anything in the nature of a penalty imposed on the member.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that some procedures by which political parties impose Party discipline on their members may well be unlawful when imposed because of the members' activities in Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This precludes most methods of Party discipline. I also draw your attention to Clause 16 ss3 (a) (b) (c) under section 7 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 (Cth). With regard to individuals, section 7 provides for maximum penalties of six months imprisonment (ss1) or a fine up to $5,000 (ss 5 (a)). Under this section corporations are subject to maximum fines of $25,000. (ss 5 (b)). It does not matter if the organisation is incorporated under Commonwealth or State legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly the Senate resolutions and the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 preclude items 1 &amp; 2 of the resolution and therefore State Council will be in breach of these provisions if it considers them as grounds to support the resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My view is confirmed by Harry Evans, Clerk of the Senate, considered internationally as the ultimate authority on matters of privilege. His opinion is supported and confirmed by the Hon Clive Griffiths MLC, President of the Legislative Council in Western Australia who is also acknowledged as a distinguished authority on privilege. Mr Griffiths is the longest serving Presiding Officer in the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the point of order: what Senator Crichton-Browne is claiming to be fact is an assertion in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> at best. It is not a matter of established fact. The standing order is written so that clearly this chamber will not reflect on members either within the chamber or in another place. Within the traditional interpretation of that standing order, Senator Crichton-Browne clearly is out of order and Senator Hill's point must be upheld.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Watson)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I have sought some advice from the clerk. I refer to statements by a previous President whereby statements by senators about matters of fact, including statements about persons protected by standing orders, did not amount to offensive words, merely on the basis that they are alleged to be false. That is a matter for refutation in debate. It is not a question of order for the chair. Given that sort of background, I think there may be some difficulty in upholding the point of order by Senator Hill. However, I would ask Senator Crichton-Browne to be very careful in terms of the implications of his assertions that can reflect perhaps unfairly on the member of another House.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995 (the bill) will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It includes ten measures which give effect to announcements in the 1995-96 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is mostly drafted in the new style emerging from the tax law improvement project. This will help taxpayers and their advisers in understanding the proposed changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Capital gains tax measures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1995-96 Budget included a number of measures relating to capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments relating to value shifting</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes amendments to Division 19A of Part IIIA which operates to prevent the creation of capital losses, or reduction of capital gains realised on the disposal of shares or loans in a company. Losses can be created (or gains reduced) by shifting value out of the shares or loans through the transfer of assets to commonly owned companies for low or nil consideration. Where a value shift is taken to have occurred, the cost bases of shares and loans in the transferor company are reduced to reflect the transferred value. The proposed amendments will generally operate to reduce the costs for taxpayers in complying with Division 19A, and to rectify certain anomalies in its current operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compliance costs will be reduced by enabling companies to transfer depreciable assets generally at their written down value without the need to make cost base adjustments provided that the market value of the assets is not substantially greater. Companies will also be able to group some assets that are transferred rather than deal with them on an asset by asset basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A simplified test will also be applied for assets acquired prior to the time at which the transferor and transferee companies came under common ownership. This measure will simplify the operation of the law, reduce uncertainty and thereby reduce compliance costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An anti avoidance measure is included in the bill so that Division 19A will apply to the creation and transfer of rights relating to an asset where the asset has not itself been transferred. Where the consideration for the transfer of the new asset is less than its market value, a value shift will be taken to have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will also make a number of other technical amendments to Division 19A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments, which will have no significant impact on revenue, will apply to transfers of assets after 7.30pm AEST on 9 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Increase in personal-use asset thresholds</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill increases the thresholds applicable to both listed and non-listed personal-use assets to $500 and $10,000 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to increase the thresholds for listed and non-listed personal-use assets will apply to disposals of assets occurring on or after 1 July 1995. The amendments will result in a cost to revenue of up to $2 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Taxable Australian assets</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will clarify the provisions relating to the disposal of certain taxable Australian assets. Some taxpayers have argued that gains on the disposal of taxable Australian assets used solely to produce franked dividends or income subject to withholding tax in Australia (such as certain shares in Australian companies and assets used in a permanent establishment in Australia) are not subject to capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This interpretation of the law is contrary to the clear intention of parliament. The amendments will ensure that capital gains tax will apply appropriately to disposals by non-residents of all taxable Australian assets and, thereby, will give effect to the intention underlying the existing law. They will apply to disposals of taxable Australian assets on or after 20 September 1985, which is the date from which capital gains tax applies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial impact of this measure is unquantifiable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Exempt receipts</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains measures that will extend the existing capital gains tax relief which applies to a gain realised on the disposal of shares in a foreign company where the disposal also gives rise to a tax exempt non-portfolio dividend. The capital gain is reduced by the amount of the exempt dividend as though the dividend was taxable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, capital gains tax relief applies in relation to the disposal of shares in foreign companies which were created after 25 June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes that capital gains tax relief will also be available in relation to disposals of shares in foreign companies where the shares were created before 26 June 1992. This measure will apply to disposals occurring from the 1990-91 year of income, which is the year from which the exemption provided for non-portfolio dividends also applies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A related measure will ensure that disposals of shares which take place after 7.30pm AEST on 9 May 1995 and which give rise to non-portfolio dividends from foreign companies which are exempt from income tax, will only qualify for capital gains tax relief to the extent that the dividends are not paid out of a share capital account, share premium account or revaluation reserve of the foreign company. The bill also modifies the existing general capital gains tax relief which applies in relation to gains realised on the disposal of assets where a capital amount is expressly included (in whole or in part) in the assessable income of a taxpayer. The existing general capital gains tax relief will be modified to apply specifically to disposals of rights to receive eligible termination payments. The amendments will apply to disposals taking place after 7.30pm AEST on 9 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial impact of these measures is unquantifiable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Compulsory rollover of assets</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will provide that, where a company disposes of an asset to a related company and the disposal would give rise to a capital loss, a compulsory capital gains tax rollover will generally apply in relation to the transfer of the asset.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An exception is provided, subject to safeguards, where the company into which the loss asset is transferred is to be sold or floated within a specified time period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will apply to transfers of assets between related companies taking place after 7.30pm AEST on 9 May 1995. They will prevent a potentially significant risk to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment or replacement of trust deeds</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that a capital gains tax rollover will be available in relation to the disposal of the assets of a complying approved deposit fund (ADF) that would otherwise occur as a consequence of the conversion of the ADF to a complying superannuation fund. A rollover will also be available in relation to a disposal of the assets of an existing complying ADF or complying superannuation fund where the trust deed of the ADF or superannuation fund is amended or replaced in order to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rollover will only be available where there is no change in the assets of the fund or interest of members in the fund as a consequence of the conversion of the ADF to a superannuation fund, or the amendment or replacement of the trust deed of the ADF or superannuation fund. This measure will apply to disposals of assets taking place on or after 12 January 1994, the date from which certain amendments to the CGT relating to settlements of trusts and transfers of property to trusts took effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revenue impact of this proposal is insignificant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Dividend imputation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the dividend imputation provisions as a result of the increase in the company tax rate from 33% to 36% with effect from the 1995-96 income year. The amendments, which will apply from 1 July 1995, will allow companies to record franking credits and debits and distribute imputation credits to shareholders by reference to tax paid at 36%. The value of existing 33% and 39% franking credits will be preserved for shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will reduce compliance costs for most companies because they will convert from the present dual franking account system to a single franking account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also correct certain defects in the current dividend imputation provisions relating to life insurance companies. The amendments will apply from the time the defects in the current provisions first arose.One amendment will prevent an unintended gain to the revenue and the other amendment will prevent a significant potential loss to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the dividend imputation amendments, the bill also provides for the calculation of class C franking deficit tax and deficit deferral tax. These taxes are imposed by the Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Amendment Bill 1995 and the Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Amendment Bill 1995 respectively. These separate bills are required for constitutional reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Franking credits&mdash;international profit misallocation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1995-96 Budget the government announced a measure to deny franking credits for profit shifting adjustments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current imputation system for company taxation, transfer pricing or non-arm's length dealing adjustments resulting in additional tax payable by an Australian resident company will give rise to a franking credit. This provision of a franking credit largely negates the additional tax payable by the resident company because the profits, which have been taxed under the transfer pricing and non-arm's length dealing adjustment provisions, have already been shifted or misallocated offshore and are not actually in Australia. Accordingly, the franking credits arising from the payment of the additional company tax assessed as a result of the transfer pricing adjustments can be used to frank profit distributions that would not otherwise be franked dividends and subject to the relevant tax relief measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment will ensure that the Australian revenue is not disadvantaged by international transfer pricing practices or non-arm's length dealings which misallocate or shift profits offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Demutualisation of insurance companies</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasurer announced in the 1995-96 Budget that specific taxation measures would be introduced for the demutualisation of mutual life and general insurance companies. These measures are proposed in this bill. The bill provides that a demutualisation may occur under a specified method and then describes the taxation consequences of certain transactions which may occur in the course of the demutualisation. All of the methods of demutualisation require that the interests of members in the mutual company will be extinguished in exchange for ordinary shares in the demutualised company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that capital gains tax will not apply to the surrender by a member of his or her membership interests in a mutual insurance company or a mutual affiliate company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill establishes, for capital gains tax purposes, the date and cost of acquisition of shares acquired by former members as part of the demutualisation process. In relation to a life insurance company, the deemed acquisition cost of shares will be determined by reference to the embedded value of the company. For general insurance companies the deemed acquisition cost of shares will be determined by reference to the net tangible assets of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No capital loss will be available in relation to the disposal of demutualisation shares and interests prior to the listing of ordinary shares in the demutualised entity. After listing, the deemed cost of acquisition of the shares will be the lesser of the amount calculated by reference to the embedded value or net tangible assets of the company and the last published price at which the demutualisation shares were traded on their first day of trading.The new provisions substantially relate to the application of the capital gains and losses provisions. However, parallel provisions have been included for transactions which would otherwise lead to amounts being included in the assessable income of a taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will only apply to demutualisations of mutual companies that were in existence at 7.30pm AEST on 9 May 1995. The nature of the measure is such that the cost to revenue cannot be reliably estimated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Establishment costs of horticultural plants</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 29 November 1994, the Treasurer and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy announced that a form of taxation write-off would be extended to expenditure on new horticultural plantations. The details of the form of write-off were announced on 9 May 1995 as part of the 1995-96 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the amendments is to give capital expenditure on horticultural plantations such as orchards and perennial crops comparable tax treatment to capital expenditure in other industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill allows taxpayers to write off the original capital expenditure incurred in establishing horticultural plants which are used, or are held ready for use, by taxpayers to produce assessable income in businesses of horticulture. The period over which the expenditure is written off will be based on the effective life of the plants, and gives the same rate of deduction as prime cost (or `straight line') depreciation of plant and equipment with the same effective life. Where effective life is less than three years there is an immediate write-off for establishment expenditure to the first taxpayer to use the plant, or hold it ready for use, to produce assessable income from a business of horticulture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is expected to be a cost to revenue of $1 million in 1997-98, $2 million in 1998-99 and $4 million in 1999-2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Forestry plantations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will give effect to the measures announced in the 1995-96 Budget relating to  immature forests and plantations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure is designed to overcome an anomaly that exists in some circumstances where an established but immature plantation or forest is purchased by a taxpayer engaged in forestry operations, and subsequently sold with the timber still standing. This taxpayer may be taxed on the gross value of the standing timber rather than the net profit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure provides that where a taxpayer, who is engaged in timber operations and has purchased an established but immature plantation or forest, sells that plantation or forest after 9 May 1995 outside the normal course of business the taxpayer is assessed on the net profit from the sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also contains certain anti-avoidance provisions relating to non arm's length transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is expected to be a cost to revenue of $1 million in 1995-96 and $4 million in subsequent years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Research and development</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1995-96 Budget the government announced a measure to deny a deduction for expenditure on research and development activities incurred to a private tax exempt body where that expenditure is not fully at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a company incurs expenditure in relation to research and development activities carried out on its behalf, the arrangements are often structured in such a way that the company receives a guaranteed return for its expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When expenditure is incurred to a tax exempt body, that body faces no tax liability on its income. Therefore the arrangement may support higher guaranteed returns than an arrangement in which expenditure is incurred to a taxpayer. In effect, the Commonwealth is funding the higher guaranteed return. The company owning the research will derive a tax benefit because of the tax exempt status of the researcher.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment will ensure that companies receive the same taxation treatment for research and development expenditure incurred to private tax exempt entities as is presently provided for expenditure incurred to public tax exempt entities. If there is any guaranteed return for the expenditure, the expenditure will not be deductible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transitional provisions will protect companies relying on a finance scheme approved by the Industry Research and Development Board before the budget and implemented by 3 August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is expected to be a gain to revenue of $20 million in 1995-96, $85 million in 1996-97, $120 million in 1997-98 and 145 million in 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Wholesale sales tax&mdash;exemption for rice milk </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes to amend the sales tax law to exempt rice milk from sales tax as recently announced by the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will ensure that rice milk is treated for sales tax purposes the same as other similar milk and soy milk beverages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost to revenue of exempting rice milk from sales tax is estimated to be less than $300,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Trust losses</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill gives effect to the government's 1995-96 Budget announcement that new rules will be introduced to limit the circumstances in which trusts can deduct current year and prior year losses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is making these changes to stop the significant erosion of revenue that has been occurring through trafficking in trust losses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax law already contains tests which limit the deductibility of losses incurred by companies. The proposed rules that are to apply to trusts will differ in some respects from those that apply to companies, reflecting the different characteristics of trusts. The government has been concerned to ensure that the law operates fairly and has therefore decided that the tests to be satisfied before losses are deductible will vary depending on the type of trust.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, family trusts will generally be able to deduct losses, provided that members of the same family are the only persons who could benefit from the trust.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special rules will also apply to widely held listed unit trusts. These rules will help to minimise compliance costs for this type of trust.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While fixed trusts will be subject to a continuity of ownership test, non family discretionary trusts will be subject to continuity of ownership, continuity of control and pattern of distribution tests. This reflects the fact that it is not possible to apply the same beneficial ownership test to discretionary trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trusts (including family trusts) will be subject to an income injection test to ensure generally that trust losses are not used by outsiders to shelter their income from tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exceptions from these measures are provided for complying superannuation funds, complying approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. The measures will also not apply to deceased estates for a reasonable period of administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed rules designed to prevent trafficking in trust losses necessarily reflect the complex nature of the different types of trusts. The amendments are therefore lengthy but, as already indicated, they are designed to ensure fairness in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drafting approach for these amendments follows the new tax law improvement style and the structure follows that of the redrafted company loss provisions which are due to be introduced into Parliament later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to revenue from the proposed changes is $90 million in 1995-96, $185 million in 1996-97, $155 million in 1997-98 and $65 million in 1998-99.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the States Grants (Primary And Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 to give effect to initiatives announced in the 1995-96 budget and to provide for cost supplementation of grants for 1995 and 1996 in accordance with established policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes an extension of the early literacy program to 1996. This program provides grants to foster literacy development for children in the early years of schooling. Some $6.666 million is to be made available to government schools and $2.208 million to non-government schools in the year. As in 1995, there will be special emphasis on children disadvantaged by low socio-economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another budget initiative reflected in the bill is a proposal for a new program of grants to non-government special schools to assist students with disabilities to make the transition to mainstream school education or pursue further training or employment. An amount of $3.22 million is to be provided in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final budget decision reflected in the bill is the cessation of new projects in 1996 under the gender equity program, the gifted and talented children program and for staff training, development and community liaison under the hostels for rural school students program. These initiatives have either served their purpose or are now more appropriately the responsibility of other bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides for supplementation of capital and recurrent grants to reflect movements in costs. For 1995 this means an additional $7 million for capital purposes and $55 million for recurrent programs, and for 1996 an additional $56 million for recurrent programs and a further $7 million for capital programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is an omnibus measure proposing the validation of certain Ministerial declarations and the amendment of three Bounty Acts; namely, the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 (the Computer Bounty Act), the Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act 1985 (the Machine Tools and Robots Act) and the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Act 1994 (the Fuel Ethanol Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three major elements proposed in this bill. The first relates to the validation of certain untabled Ministerial declarations made under the Computer Bounty Act and the Machine Tools and Robots Act. The non-tabling of these declarations was discovered as a result of an investigation into the status of all legal instruments administered by the Department of Industry, Science and Technology that was instigated by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology after the discovery of a similar administrative oversight in relation to guidelines under the Industry Research and Development Act 1986. The Minister made a statement in the Senate on 26 June 1995 concerning the bounty legislation problem and the validation element of this bill is designed to address that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the Computer Bounty Act and the Machine Tools and Robots Act have a declaration facility by which the Minister can vary the classes of equipment eligible for bounty so that new technologies can be brought into the schemes as they arise. The facility is designed to allow the schemes to cater for the rapid technological advances which are a feature of these industry sectors. In order to maintain Parliamentary scrutiny of the classes of equipment eligible for bounty, the Ministerial declarations are subject to the same tabling and disallowance procedures applicable to other forms of subsidiary legislation by the express application of section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure to table 20 declarations under the Computer Bounty Act and a further 12 under the Machine Tools and Robots Act has resulted in each declaration being invalidated after 15 sitting days of its making. A consequence of the legal invalidity of the declarations is that all decisions and acts or things done in reliance on those declarations (including applications claiming bounty, assessments of claims and decisions to pay or refuse bounty), are also invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 5 and 6 of the bill propose to address the invalidity problems by validating the declarations, and any decisions made, or acts or things done, in reliance on those declarations, from the time of their commencement as notified in the Gazette, until the Royal Assent commencement of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 7 of the bill expressly extinguishes the Commonwealth's right to recover any amounts paid on the production of goods purportedly made bountiable under the declaration facility of both acts. This will overcome the situation of Commonwealth officers having a duty to recover what have become unauthorised payments out of Consolidated Revenue and is appropriate given the fact that the various payments that have been made in reliance on the declarations over the years were always intended to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second element of the bill involves the incorporation of the effect of the 3 valid current declarations into the Computer Bounty Act and the Machine Tools and Robots Act. Schedules 2 and 3 to the bill incorporate into each of the acts the various classes of goods which are presently bountiable via the declaration facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The goods to be inserted under the relevant definitions of "bountiable equipment" have been the subject of new declarations Gazetted in August and September 1995 and have been tabled in each House of Parliament as required of section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. These 3 declarations remade the effect of 7 of the invalid declarations and were made so that bounty payments relating to claims on hand could be processed during the time between the discovery of the invalidity and the passage of this validating bill. The remaining invalid declarations were not remade as their effect had already been incorporated into the Principal acts by various Bounty Legislation Amendment Bills or they had become redundant because the technology to which they related has been superseded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incorporation of the effect of these current valid declarations into the Principal acts is intended to bring all the goods which are currently eligible for bounty under the one piece of principal legislation, as opposed to a mixture of Legislation plus disparate declarations. I consider that periodically incorporating future declarations into the Principal acts will also help to ensure their legal correctness and legal drafting in a way that has not always been the case in the past. This should obviate the need for repeating this exercise in the future by better aligning the declaration facility with the express parliamentary controls in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final element of the bill implements the Government's 1995-96 Budget decision in relation to the Fuel Ethanol Act. The Fuel Ethanol Act  gives effect to a scheme to assist in the development of a competitive, robust and ecologically sustainable fuel ethanol industry. The three year scheme, which commenced on 1 July 1994, provides for the payment of a bounty of 18 cents for each litre of fuel ethanol produced, providing certain criteria are met. One of these criteria is that bounty should only be paid on `new production' of fuel ethanol, which effectively imposed an extra production requirement on pre-1 July 1994 producers by only making bountiable that production in excess of the average of fuel ethanol produced in 1992 and 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the eligibility criteria under the Fuel Ethanol Act in Schedule 1 to the bill are to give effect to the 1995 Budget decision to ensure all eligible fuel ethanol producers can claim bounty on the same production criteria, irrespective of whether they were engaged in production prior to the 1 July 1994 commencement of the Fuel Ethanol Act.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (5.53 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week the advocates of Queensland's largest meat processors launched a scathing attack on the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) and the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has urged AMH to withdraw an application for a non-union enterprise flexibility agreement at its Rockhampton plant and has urged that the plant operate on a trial agreement with the union for three months to allow enterprise bargaining negotiations to continue at other AMH plants. AMH has viciously attacked the commission for challenging its rights to threaten and intimidate its workers in its bid to drive down wages and conditions in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fortnight ago a question was raised in the House of Representatives concerning the Rockhampton plant of Australia Meat Holdings and some rather dubious industrial tactics used by the employers to achieve non-union enterprise flexibility agreements. Mr Brereton revealed that AMH used a good deal of outside assistance and outside influence at its Rockhampton plant to persuade workers to accept the EFA. The minister revealed that Mr Bruce Townsend and a team of 14 people had been secretly employed to act as agents provocateurs and to bust the AMIEU in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Information has been provided to me that Mr Bruce Studley Townsend has been employed as a strikebreaker by Mr Keith Lawson, managing director of AMH, Mr Les Parker, manager of the Rockhampton Meatworks, and Mr John Hughes, a senior industrial officer at AMH. I am informed that up to 15 strikebreakers have been employed at $800 per week cash in hand and that Mr Townsend himself has received $3,000 per week cash in hand. Mr Townsend was paid by  the  Ipswich office  of  AMH.  Mr Townsend's duties included phone tapping union members, videotaping union meetings through the boot of a car, intimidating workers, and persuading workers to cross picket lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the voracity of Mr Townsend and his team for taping and recording, it might not be surprising to learn that the arbitration commission has moved its hearings from the plant to the local courthouse. Other members of Mr Townsend's Rockhampton team include an ex-prison officer and an ex-police officer. It seems that the job of these people is to act as heavies and to persuade people involved in the industrial dispute at the Rockhampton plant with violence if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bruce Townsend is a resident of Tasmania and is managing director of the firm Australian Security and Investigation. He is registered in Tasmania as a licensed security agent and process server. However, Mr Townsend has a long record of strikebreaking in Tasmania, such as at APM, and he is well known to the timberworkers' union. He has also appeared previously in Queensland where he worked with Mr Graham Haycroft of Troubleshooters Available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Troubleshooters Available has also specialised in strikebreaking in Tasmania and Victoria, mainly in the building industry but in the meat industry as well. Troubleshooters Available supplied unskilled contract labour for the Camperdown abattoir in Victoria some four years ago, enabling the employers to lock out the local meatworkers who were members of the union and who were not prepared to work for wages and conditions well below the award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Townsend says he is a consultant and is not registered to operate in Queensland as an investigator or as a security agent. He says his main function at the Rockhampton meatworks is to `advise on enterprise bargaining agreements and prepare precedence reports'. This, of course, reflects the growing trend within AMH towards the Americanisation of its industrial relations. This is brought about by the employment of strikebreakers and union busters. Mr Townsend is no ordinary worker. His job is clearly to antagonise and intimidate union members. The company, AMH, provides strikebreakers with false payroll slips to make them look like genuine workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Townsend was engaged by senior management of Conagra in Queensland who happen to be closely identified with the Liberal Party in that state. In other words, senior Liberal Party members have been directly involved in these unseemly events. Senior Liberal Party figures also figured during the meatworkers' dispute at Camperdown in Victoria during 1991-92. The local meatworkers set up a picket line outside the Camperdown abattoir and an agent provocateur appeared on the scene. His name was Warwick Leeson. He employed rather crude tactics of verbal abuse, throwing rocks and eggs at picketers, and even driving his car into one of the unionists. Later, some of his associates were involved in even more violent acts including the bashing of three unionists with shovels and iron bars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Leeson, a private investigator, was hired by the law firm of Kroger and Kroger to gather information for a damages action against the AMIEU. Leeson had to provoke and try and incite violence and disruption by the picketers in order to make a case for Kroger and Kroger in its prosecution of the AMIEU. At that time Mr Kroger was president of the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party and a long-time associate of Mr Costello, the current Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Warwick Leeson was himself a Liberal Party member and in fact served as a branch president. It is widely rumoured that Mr Michael Kroger first used Mr Leeson's sleazy investigative techniques to dig up dirt on the wets or moderates in Victoria during the great purge of the Liberal Party under Mr Kroger's presidency. Mr Kroger, along with several senior Liberal Party members of parliament, attended an hysterical meeting at the Camperdown race track in support of the anti-union contractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kroger and Mr Costello have long shared a vision of a brave new world of industrial relations&mdash;one where workers would have no organised representation and where employers can determine wages and conditions at whim. Powerless workers have two choices: take it or have no job. They talk about negotiation and cooperation but, in reality, we have the Warwick Leesons and the Bruce Townsends running around with tape-recorders, with rotten eggs, and even with weapons, to coerce, intimidate and frighten workers into submission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is this the sort of industrial relations the Liberal Party stands for? Is this the sort of thuggery they are prepared to tolerate: stooges paid by employers to bust up union meetings, hired guns used to get contractors in place to reduce wages and conditions? As Minister Brereton has made clear, there is no place in Australian industrial relations for professional strike breakers and secret surveillance and the taping of picket lines, union meetings or anything else. A Labor government in my view remains committed to ensuring that enterprise bargaining is pursued in an environment free from coercion. </PARA>

On the basis of a series of facts which are being put by Senator Crichton-Browne&mdash;which basically are that various documents were improperly obtained, circulated and so forth&mdash;anyone listening to that statement is invited by the statement to draw conclusions as to the motive; it must always follow from a set of facts. Surely you determine from the chair whether he is imputing the motive&mdash;whether the circumstances lead to a conclusion that that is the motive. In other words, you listen to the facts and from that you draw a conclusion as to the motive. If the logical conclusion is that the facts are to impute improper motives, which I argue that it is, then under standing order 193 that is improper.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hepatitis C is a blood borne virus affecting up to 200,000 Australians. It is estimated that up to 9,000 people are newly affected each year. Eighty per cent of those exposed to the virus will become carriers, 25 per cent will develop chronic liver disease and up to 10 per cent will die as a result. The virus attacks the liver and over the past year it has become the most common cause for liver transplants. There are many unknowns about hepatitis C and that is why I raised it with Senator Crowley a couple of weeks ago. Drug users and former drug addicts could be unknown carriers. It is speculated that tattoos and body piercing, or even the shared use of razors or toothbrushes, may contribute to the spread of the virus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report released in October by the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council showed that the government has done virtually nothing to implement a national strategy on hepatitis C a year after its adoption. The report also showed that the government has skimped on the resources for the strategy and less than $4 million has been spent over two years to fund the prevention and education of the virus. Education is very important. I understand that guidelines for GPs and others will be published shortly in line with the strategy that was drawn up over a year ago. This $4 million that has been spent compares very unfavourably with funding for other medical programs. Just for interest, over the next two years $110 million has been earmarked for HIV and AIDS research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The low priority given by the government demonstrates that the government simply is not serious about or does not understand the hepatitis C crisis we are facing. It is a matter of urgency. The government has not allocated enough of its resources or time to education programs or giving sufferers access to treatment they need. I understand that the drug interferon alpha 2B is the only treatment available for hepatitis C, and each day sees the queues for interferon growing larger&mdash;as with the queues of people waiting to have their conditions assessed. Interferon has been subsidised by the federal government since 1 October 1994, but I understand that the states and territories cannot comply with a national action plan because of funding constraints from the federal government. An expert on hepatitis, Professor Geoff Farrell, was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 21 October as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the major single problem for hepatitis C patients at the moment is getting access to services where they can get appropriate counselling and treatment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Frequent changes to both tax and superannuation law are confusing, not only to the public but also to the experts who are obliged to keep up with all the amendments passed by this parliament. A good example was a recent case in the Federal Court of Australia. The Queensland Registry, General Division, was called upon to adjudicate between the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the applicant, and Wayne Cyril Hiscock, as trustee for Osborne Fruit Drinks Superannuation Fund, the respondent. The judgment highlights the complex process of present day law making. This case illustrates very vividly that, if administrative decision makers such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal find it hard to know the law as expressed by the parliament, it must be even harder for the trustees and their advisers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was a provision of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act of 1987&mdash;which has now been superseded by the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act&mdash;as it stood following an amendment which had not been drawn to the attention of the tribunal. Relevant provisions were section 12(3A) of the act and section 49 of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Act 1993. These provisions deal with the ISC's discretion regarding a breach of, in this case, the in-house assets rule.The intent of section 49 was to limit the discretion available to the ISC. The fund in question was affected only if section 49 was found to have a retrospective effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 7(2H) of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act provides that standards may be prescribed with respect to investment of assets of superannuation funds. If there is compliance with those standards, the trustees of the fund receive a notice from the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner under section 12 which entitles the fund to concessional rates of taxation, which are currently to a maximum of 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem for the Osborne Fruit Drinks superannuation fund was that it did not comply with those standards during the income year ended 30 June 1991. The trustee sought the exercise of the commissioner's discretion under section 13(1) of the act, which provided that trustees might satisfy the commissioner that because of special circumstances that existed it was reasonable for the commissioner to treat the fund as if it had satisfied those standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before coming to its decision, the court noted that section 12(3A) had been inserted by an amending act, No. 92 of 1992, taking effect on 1 July 1992. That provided that, in the making of a decision under section 12(3) as to whether a fund satisfied the conditions, the commissioner was obliged to disregard a breach of the superannuation fund if certain conditions were present. The reference to a breach was not further qualified as to its nature or as to the time when it was to have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later on 24 October 1994 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal substituted a decision. The fund satisfied the conditions in relation to the income year ended 30 June 1991. It did so by applying the provisions of section 12(3A), which, as it observed, were not in force during 1991 but were in force when the delegate's decision was made, and held that the section was to be applied by the tribunal. It noted in particular that there were no transitional provisions relating to the amendment in question and nothing else to suggest that its ordinary meaning could not be given effect to. That is, it was to be applied when a decision was made after 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was indeed unfortunate that the tribunal's attention was not drawn to a particular subsection that had been the subject of a further statutory provision. Those amendments took effect on 30 July 1993 and, more specifically, by the provision of section 49 of act No. 7 of 1993 entitled `Transitional' which came into effect on 27 May 1993. The Hon. Justice Kiefel said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What it seems to me then the Tribunal, not properly informed, fell into a legal error in applying the provisions of section 12(3a). There does remain the question as to the application of section 13(1) of the 1987 Act.</PARA>
<PARA>He further stated that it was that provision upon which the delegate's decision was originally based and that its application was argued before the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that I wish to raise in the Senate tonight concerns an overview of the 1985 tax summit. That overview was provided by an eminent practitioner, Mr Richard Buchanan, a former president of the Tax Institute of Australia and a current partner of KPMG in Melbourne. He presented a paper to the University of New South Wales entitled `ATAX Tax Summit' on 20 September this year. The thrust of Mr Buchanan's speech was that, while the income tax system may generally be fairer, there was a significant increase in the additional cost of compliance and complexity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Buchanan states that, while the 1985 summit was intended to benefit the Australian people, there were a number of goals at that summit that were not achieved. He said that the system was still biased against the honest, the productive, the worker and the saver. More importantly, he said that the system was biased against the exporter and the home producer. It is this bias which costs Australian jobs, Australian investment and Australian exports. Australia has paid and continues to pay a very high price for this. One of the aims of the 1985 summit was to attack the black economy. However, after scrapping option C&mdash;the consumption tax&mdash;little has been achieved in overcoming the problems of the black economy, and both cash and barter transactions continue to thrive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The percentage of total federal taxation revenue&mdash;that is, individual income tax&mdash;raised 55 per cent in 1984-85. Ten years later, if FBT is included, it raises 54.9 per cent, which effectively means that there has been no change. However, in that time the burden on Australian taxpayers, particularly business taxpayers, to collect and account for tax has placed a significant hidden cost on those businesses. For example, the income tax legislation has become a lot weightier. John Howard referred to this when responding to the budget earlier this year. The CCH published act in 1985 weighed 2.1 kilos, whereas it now weighs 5.1 kilos. It does point out, however, that whilst the Australian taxation system over 10 years may be a lot fairer it is certainly a lot costlier for business to comply with. While the change to introduce the imputation system of taxation of corporate profits was a material and worthwhile change, it did not shift the emphasis and reliance on the taxation of savings to consumption, and consumption remains a relatively lowly tax by comparison with savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Buchanan, of course, does draw on research undertaken by Mr Phillip Holt, who is the Chief Executive of the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales. Mr Phillip Holt indicates that, if indirect taxes could be removed from the costs of exports, Australia could boost exports by $3.9 billion by the year 2000, as our products would be more competitive on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise these matters of general interest in this debate because I believe that the cost of compliance and the uncertainty of the legislation is becoming a very significant issue in our tax law. Therefore, I ask: what chance does the ordinary John or Mary Citizen have of understanding and complying with this act when the experts cannot get it right and when the costs of compliance are just so high?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this evening of 12 November 1995, I rise to mark the fourth anniversary of the Dili massacre. Yesterday I attended a memorial service at All Saints Chapel in Perth, Western Australia, to commemorate the event. I must say that the rally which took place afterwards was a credit to the people who organised it. There were those who felt, and feel, quite emotional about this matter&mdash;and quite understandably so. They had called upon the organisers to burn an Indonesian flag, and I note that they exercised constraint in not doing so. For that, I compliment them because I do believe that a good deal can be achieved by constructive criticism and constructive debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in Lisbon earlier this year when there was an international conference on the question of East Timor, and I believe that there was constructive debate at that conference. Shortly after that there was in Austria, I understand, a meeting between most of the parties concerned&mdash;and, hopefully, something will come of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do note, with great disappointment, that the Indonesian authorities refused admission into East Timor to a group of international observers. One was Senator David Norris from Ireland, whom I met at the conference I mentioned previously; another was Bishop Soma, a Catholic bishop of Japan; and another was an Anglican minister, Ann Baten, of New Zealand. I also note that in that group there was Mr Paul Stewart, an Australian musician and the brother of a journalist who was killed in East Timor some 20 years ago; he also wanted to go to East Timor to mark the anniversary of the Dili massacre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only say that, when protesters exercise the constraint that these did, the Indonesian authorities do not advance matters by refusing the admission of such international observers. As I say, I have met Senator David Norris from Ireland. He is not, I believe, a security risk. He is not the sort of person who would go around making trouble. I can only urge the Indonesian authorities to open up East Timor so that people of this sort, of this standing, can visit East Timor and that perhaps some progress can be made in resolving the problem there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the Pacific Conference of Catholic Archbishops expressed a great deal of concern about the interference there is with the freedom to practise the Catholic religion in East Timor by East Timorese people and, indeed, the freedom to speak their own language and to engage in their own culture. Any such restraint must be the subject of great criticism by Australia. This is something which is happening on our doorstep, several hundred kilometres from the northern border of the state which I represent. This sort of action and the actions of disallowing the people that I have mentioned entrance into East Timor on the occasion of this anniversary does not do anything to advance the resolution of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal by Indonesia to have Mr Mantiri act as that country's ambassador was met with widespread criticism. I can only say that I commend the Indonesian government for its decision not to push through with that decision because to do so would have been a highly provocative act. I am pleased to see that was not done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a strong relationship with Indonesia, thankfully so, but when friends have a difference of opinion they express that in a very frank manner and they do not hold back. They can talk freely with each other because that is the basis of any strong relationship, of any relationship based on friendship. Therefore, I take it that the Indonesian authorities will not take what I say the wrong way and, hopefully, will look at it in a constructive manner and appreciate that, in my state in Western Australia, the people who attended that rally did so with a good deal of constraint and that they specifically took measures to avoid offending the Indonesian government by the burning of that country's flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In return, I ask the Indonesian authorities to behave similarly and to appreciate that there are people who have an interest in the matter in East Timor and that there are East Timorese who certainly would like a more open approach to this problem. I have couched my address today in rather restrained terms because I believe that adopting a radical stance does not achieve anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today we moved a condolence motion for the death of Yitzhak Rabin. We heard in this very chamber how he had expressed that the killing had to stop, that the time for war was over and that constructive measures were needed if a peaceful resolution was to be obtained in the Middle East. I would put to the Senate that the situation in East Timor is the same. It is a situation where radical measures on either side will not help, but firm constructive dialogue and action will succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall the motion that was moved by His Honour Mr Justice Michael Kirby at the conference in Lisbon whereby he set out some specific steps which could be taken to promote a resolution in East Timor. I commend those steps. One of them was to open up East Timor more to visits by members of foreign parliaments and to increase the presence of bodies like the Red Cross. I can see no prejudice to the Indonesian authorities in allowing this. I can see no breach in security in allowing this. I can only question what their motives must be in such an over-reaction in not allowing people of the sort I have described admission into East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I bring to the Senate's attention, on the fourth anniversary of the Dili massacre, the unfortunate actions which occurred. We must not forget that that was a situation which involved the death of unarmed civilians in a non-violent demonstration&mdash;deaths which were caused by the military. This is not denied by the Indonesian authorities, which they themselves commissioned an inquiry into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is appropriate that, whilst we work towards strengthening our ties with Indonesia, we do not forget things such as the Dili massacre, we do not forget the deaths of the Australian journalists concerned. To do otherwise would be a sham. It would be an affront to any strengthening of the relationship with Indonesia. This is a matter which should be addressed front on and discussed frankly with the Indonesia authorities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, upon notice, on 6 July 1995:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With reference to the recent transport of radioactive waste from the Australian Defence Industries' St Mary's site to Woomera Rangehead:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) Did the report Transport of Certain Radioactive Waste Material from Sydney to Interim Storage at Woomera Rangehead contain on page 1 a table entitled `Relative doses from some radiation related activities'; (b) was this table prepared by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation: if so by whom and according to what principles: and (c) why does this table not contain actual units of radiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(a) Did this table provide what it called relative doses according to which, the dose received by standing for one hour at a distance of two metres from a freight container full of St Marys waste, was the same as that from a return flight from Los Angeles, and the same as 18 days of background radiation; and (b) does this mean that the dose received by a person standing two metres from a container will be 18 days by 24 hours, that is, 432 times background radiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Does this mean that someone such as a truck driver who was at a distance of two metres from a container of such waste for the full duration of a trip to Woomera would receive the equivalent of approximately a years worth of background radiation (or 20 chest x-rays, or 24 flights from Sydney to Los Angeles) depending on the precise length of the trip and the shielding factor of the International Standards Organisation containers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) If the figure of 20 microsieverts for dose rates in the truck cab supplied by the Department of Defence notice of intent is correct, does 20 millisievert per hour come to approximately 100 x 7 times natural background radiation of 0.23 mSv's and nearly 300 times approximately 0.06 mSv's per hour gamma component.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)(a) How do the relative doses in this table relate to statements in the Department of Defence's notice of proposal that the dose rate at the outside of the shipping containers would be less than 1 000 microsieverts per hour (that is 1 mSv per hour) and that the dose to drivers would be less than 20 mSv's; (b) why is there a 50 to 1 difference between the radiation intensity at the container surface and in the truck cab; and (c) is the figure of 20 microsieverts per hour based on actual measurement or guesswork.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Yes. The table was prepared by one of ANSTO's senior scientists. The information in it is based on published data, principally from the document `Sources and Effects of Ionising Radiation', published in 1993 by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, and the limits under the Australian Code of Practice for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Substances 1990. The Australian Radiation Laboratory was consulted in the course of the preparation of the table and is in agreement with the data in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The purpose of the table was to explain to members of the public how doses that might be received by people in proximity of the waste compared with doses from other activities. The doses were not specified in microsieverts because that would have added nothing to the explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The question is unclear. If Senator Margetts' question relates to a person standing two metres from a container for 18 days, then the data in the table means that the dose would have been 432 times one hour's background radiation dose. This amounts to about 100 microsieverts, or 5 per cent of the annual dose from background radiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. When the trucks were loaded, the drivers' cabins were about six metres in front of the freight containers and the packages of waste were positioned inside the containers in such a way as to minimise the dose rates in the cabins. Moreover, new drivers took over about half way through the trip. There were only very brief opportunities for anyone to stand at a distance of two metres from a container during the journey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The figure of 20 microsieverts per hour in the Department of Defence's Notice of Intention (NOI) for dose rates in truck cabins was an estimate, based on the information available at the time the NOI was prepared. In the event, the measured dose rates in truck cabins during the trip to the Rangehead were much lower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)(a) The actual doses from the activities listed in the table can be obtained by multiplying the relative doses by 100 microsieverts. Thus, the dose rate at the surface of the container is derived from the table as 10x100 microsieverts per hour, which equates to 1,000 microsieverts per hour as stated in the NOI. The data in the table do not refer to the dose to drivers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Radiation intensity decreases rapidly with distance and can be further reduced by placement of shielding, as happened in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) Neither. The figure was an estimate, based on the information available at the time the NOI was prepared.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) On 7 August 1995, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) handed down its decision in the Siddiqui case, a complaint that the quota on the number of overseas trained doctors able to proceed to the Australian Medical Council's (AMC) clinical examination is unlawful under the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission found that the conduct of the AMC and Minister for Health, as a member of the Australian Health Minister's Conference (AHMC), was unlawful under Section 9(1A) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission did not find that the imposition of the quota itself amounted to direct racial discrimination. Rather it found that the manner in which the quota had been applied, was discriminatory and unreasonable for the purposes of the Act. In other words, the quota had the effect of being indirect racial discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission accepted that the multiple choice question examination is a valid and legitimate method of assessing the competence of doctors. It also accepted that the restriction on undergraduate entry to Australian medical schools effectively amounted to a quota and rejected the argument that graduates from Australian medical schools are not subject to a "quota" of some kind. The Commission supported the validity of a quota on overseas trained doctors stating in its determination: "We are not persuaded that the Health Ministers acted unreasonably in determining that a quota was necessary nor in fixing it at 200 each year" and "We should observe that we reject the argument advanced for the complainant that any form of quota imposed on the admission of overseas trained doctors to registration for general practise in Australia would be discriminatory".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The effect of the determination is that any overseas trained doctor who has sat the multiple choice question examination and met the minimum standard could apply to HREOC for an order that they be allowed to proceed to the clinical examination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The HREOC decision raised a number of issues which require clarification in the Federal Court and an application for an order of review has been lodged. This process will not be completed for some time. The AMC and the Commonwealth have decided to allow the 280 candidates who met the minimum performance standards in previous sittings of the multiple choice question examination to proceed through to the clinical examination. The AMC has written to these candidates to advise them of this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) On 6 October the AMC announced that following the request from HREOC the AMC has agreed that future multiple choice question examinations will be conducted in Australia only.</PARA>

New Zealand trained doctors have never been included in the quota applied to candidates in the multiple choice question examination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) Since the AMC accredits the two New Zealand medical schools, doctors who have gained their qualification from these institutions are not required to sit the AMC exams to gain full Australian medical registration.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) (a) Doctors with temporary resident visas enter Australia to take up employment within the State and Territory health systems to fill "difficult to fill" positions on a temporary basis.

Details of languages spoken other than English are only recorded where the language skills have been tested and recognised by the Department, as this is the only data which is reliable enough to be used for operational purposes.
