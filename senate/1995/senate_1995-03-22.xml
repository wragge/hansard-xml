<PARA>Before I deal with the terms of this motion, I would like to set out some of the history which has led to it. In December 1993 it came to light that the telephone conversations of a number of Telecom customers had been monitored and recorded without their knowledge or consent. The discovery was made by the telecommunications industry regulator, Austel, in the course of its inquiry into the so-called CoT cases, also known as the Casualties of Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shock of the discovery was magnified by the extent of the deception involved. Telecom had emphatically denied to anyone who would listen to it that it would ever do such a thing, but the evidence came out, for which Austel was castigated by Telecom in a classic case of shooting the messenger, and the denials were proven to be absolutely worthless. It could be asserted that the interceptions were done in order to diagnose faults on the lines of the customers concerned, and the Australian Democrats do not deny that there are genuine maintenance reasons for listening in on customer conversations, if only briefly, to establish that a proper connection has been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But the monitoring and the taping of the Casualties of Telecom were not done for such mundane reasons. The CoTs had been in dispute with Telecom over the quality of their business phone service for years. They had experienced persistent problems with a loss of incoming calls which had caused them real loss. They were in dispute with Telecom over compensation, and it was in that context that in some cases covert monitoring and recording took place. There is clear documentary evidence that, in the case of Mrs Ann Garms of Brisbane, Telecom staff's failure to tell her that her phone was being monitored was deliberate. They were intent on disproving her claims of phone difficulties in the apparent belief that she was inventing or at least exaggerating them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The monitoring also put Telecom in an excellent position to get intelligence on Mrs Garms' legal moves and on the strategies being developed by the CoT cases, which had only just formed when the monitoring began. Information gleaned from the tapes was provided to the Telecom lawyers handling Mrs Garms' dispute. This may all sound like the stuff of paranoid delusion, and there is no doubt that there are some unfortunate people who suffer from some unfounded fears that their phones are being tapped, but Mrs Garms is not one of them. She has documentary evidence, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. Senators may recall that I tabled some of that in this chamber in August last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the really extraordinary case of Mr Robert Bray. Senators will recall that I tabled Mr Bray's story last year as well. Mr Bray had just moved to Ballarat and had a silent line connected, but it did not work properly and he asked for it to be fixed. It was, and on the first night the phone was functioning he had a long conversation with a friend in which the friend discussed his childhood experiences of abuse. The following morning Mr Bray was rung by someone claiming to be a Telecom employee who said that his calls had been broadcast in the Ballarat exchange and had been taped. Mr Bray was understandably traumatised and brought this incident to Telecom's attention. In response, a local Telecom manager took it upon himself to contact a psychiatric nurse at Ballarat's lakeside hospital suggesting that Mr Bray was in need of treatment. The nurse was given Mr Bray's silent phone number and promptly contacted him. You can imagine the impact that this had on Mr Bray. There is no doubt that the psychiatric referral took place because the employee concerned admitted that he did it and that he had done it before. There is no hard evidence that Mr Bray's phone was broadcast within the exchange. However, I have looked carefully at Mr Bray's account and his credibility, and the conclusion is inescapable that his phone calls were intercepted and were probably broadcast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we get to the crux of this motion. Despite the mountains of evidence gathered by the Australian Federal Police, who by all accounts did an excellent job, the Director of Public Prosecutions decided he could not convince a court that the law itself had been violated. If cases like those of Mrs Garms and Mr Bray cannot be prosecuted, the Democrats say that there is something wrong with that law. It should not be legal to broadcast someone's phone conversations within an exchange without that person's consent. It should not be legal to tape calls without consent, but it is. The law should be a strong deterrent to anyone who wants to do these things for sport or for industrial espionage, but it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Controversies like this are not new. In 1988 the Commonwealth Ombudsman investigated a complaint that Telecom had broadcast a customer's phone calls on an exchange speaker without that customer's consent. Telecom pledged that it would never happen again, but it has. In the last few days, I have received a statutory declaration from someone who wishes to remain anonymous, at least for the time being. That person is in dispute with Telecom. After years of phone difficulties, he recently lodged a modest claim for compensation. Shortly after, he received three anonymous phone calls from different callers implying that he and his family would suffer unless he withdrew those claims. The callers quoted parts of the person's phone conservations with other people, which could have been obtained only by intercepting his telephone calls. The person in question is well known to us. Again, he is sane, straight as a die and one of life's reliable witnesses. I do not doubt his evidence, and I have passed it to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that malicious telephone interceptions are still going on. They are damaging the lives of individuals, many of whom are already traumatised by years of dispute with Telecom. Yet the law offers them little comfort. Now the Senate has before it the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill, which seeks to address the weaknesses in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act which have made prosecution so very difficult in these cases. The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee last night held a hearing into the bill in which witness after witness said that the bill was deficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Casualties of Telecom argued that the DPP's failure to prosecute showed that the bill needed to be strengthened to make it an offence to broadcast or tape telephone conversations without customer consent. They suggested that Austel's approval also be required to bring some independent expertise to bear on the question of whether an interception was warranted. They also called for disclosure of private information by the carriers to be made an offence, which it was in relation to Telecom until 1991. They pointed out that call diversion and tracing can also be used against customers in dispute with a carrier and called for that option to be closed off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The carriers argue that the bill is vague and fails to give employees a clear dividing line between legal and illegal interceptions and that the regulations which are supposed to clarify that matter should be finalised before the legislation is voted on, not after. The carriers and the union also argue that individual employees should be immune from prosecution. We could extend that principle to give courier company employees immunity from culpable driving charges, but we disagree with that too. The point is that the bill is contentious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was one glaring omission from last night's evidence. In order to judge the competing claims about the legislation, the committee needs to know whether the Australian Federal Police did uncover evidence of covert interception for non-operational purposes and why the Director of Public Prosecutions felt unable to take that matter to court. That is the purpose of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion asks for the committee to be supplied, in confidence, with the summary of the AFP's brief of evidence. There is an identical precedent for that in relation to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> tapes. We also ask for the DPP's consideration of that brief and for legal advice from senior counsel on the prospects for prosecution. The committee is required to consider the evidence in camera and hand it back at the completion of its deliberations, unless it resolves to make some or all of it public. Before any decision to publish is made, the committee is required to hear evidence from the Minister for Justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have had extensive discussions with the government over this motion. It is my understanding that it is prepared to comply with parts of it but see the whole as a dangerous precedent, as Senator Cooney said to us this morning. The Democrats believe though that that is wrong. There is a precedent and we should keep that in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information we are seeking is relevant to the consideration of legislation now before the committee. This is not a trawling exercise. We are the legislators; we need this information to legislate. We have built in checks and balances to ensure that publication will only occur in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion also calls for relevant information from the AFP and the DPP to be released to the complainants to pursue civil remedies if they so wish. That information should, of course, be subject to the usual privacy considerations. But given the extraordinary nature of this case, in which people have been denied justice just because of a deficiency in the act, we believe this should be done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, the government strongly opposes Senator Bourne's motion. I know that my esteemed friend and colleague Senator Cooney, who has strong personal views on this, will speak on this as well, but there is a need at the outset to distinguish between the two issues involved here. The first is the inadequacy in the legislation, which the government concedes and which needs to be corrected; the second is the demand of the Senate to set itself up fundamentally in the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions, becoming a star chamber by the release of police and prosecution material to achieve this end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from anything else, as well as creating what would be an appalling precedent, the action proposed by this motion is totally unnecessary. There is a great deal of common ground between the government and the Australian Democrats on this issue. I can assure the Senate that we are as concerned as the Democrats and the opposition to see that any deficiencies that led to a failure to prosecute in the act be corrected. But we do not need to create this most unfortunate precedent. With greatest respect to the precedent quoted by Senator Bourne, which I assume referred to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> tapes, the situations are remarkably different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is demanded by this motion is that the prosecution material that actually led the Director of Public Prosecutions to the view that there should not be a prosecution in this case be handed over to the Senate. In terms of the division of responsibility between this legislative chamber and the proper role of prosecution authorities, this is an appalling request and, I say again, unnecessary because of the government's agreement that any deficiencies in the act need to be corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for the Senate&mdash;in particular, Senator Harradine has rightly asked for the position to be laid out clearly&mdash;to lay out the process that the government is prepared to provide to the Senate in order to fix the legislation. Senator Bourne is well aware of this because of the extensive discussions that have taken place between the government and herself. The process that the government has agreed to follow is that it is proposed that the Director of Public Prosecutions be asked to appear before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee to assist the committee in its deliberations on the proposed amendments. I could not think of any more helpful process than having the director himself being able to assist the committee in determining what needs to be done to the act. That may have prevented him from laying prosecutions in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of that is possible and can be done without the need for him to disclose documents that are involved in this matter. The expertise of the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to these particular cases, I would have thought, would have been invaluable to the committee in determining what amendments need to be drafted. The DPP's role in appearing before the committee, of course, should be limited to his opinion on the requirements of the necessary amendments to the act to correct the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DPP should not be required to provide information on the investigations themselves. The government strongly believes that to subject the Director of Public Prosecutions to such a process would be both unreasonable and improper. Further progress of the committee will be assisted by the government's agreement to also make the two advisings from senior counsel to the Director of Public Prosecutions available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to matters raised in paragraph (3) of Senator Bourne's motion, I am advised that the Australian Federal Police has indicated that, if individual complainants make application under the Freedom of Information Act for material relating to their own complaints, the AFP will handle those requests expeditiously and waive the normal fees. I have outlined what I think would be an absolutely proper process for achieving what we all agree needs to be done; that is, for demonstrated inadequacies in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act to be remedied by the appearance before the committee of the Director of Public Prosecutions himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of that can be achieved without the release of sensitive police and prosecution material to the Senate. This material is highly sensitive. It contains unproven allegations against individuals and organisations. If criminal charges are laid, then the relevant material will emerge through the proper judicial process, thereby protecting the rights of the accused by giving them the opportunity to meet the allegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know&mdash;and Senator Bourne has conceded it&mdash;that no absolute guarantee of in camera evidence or confidentiality can be made available by this Senate. It is a subject on which I have some strong views. I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts during its drugs in sport inquiry. I remember only too well where the reputations of individuals were shredded in the public domain under parliamentary privilege and in camera information was released. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct; Senator Panizza was there. As a result of some joint concern we had, a process began back then whereby a formal statement was handed to each witness, explaining precisely what the guarantee of in camera confidentiality was and the fact that it could not be guaranteed. So at least witnesses were provided with information that, although we could say that we would like to treat their information in confidence and take their information in camera, an absolute guarantee could not be given. It would remain that way. Therefore, whatever witnesses said to the committee had to be disclosed to the committee while fully understanding that at some later stage it may be disclosed by a determination of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne is quite correct to put that on the public record. That is fine in so far as it goes, but when we are talking about asking for police and prosecution material to be made available to a Senate committee that then wants to set itself up as a de facto director of public prosecutions, it is a very different matter altogether. Criminal investigations, the government believes, must be conducted with a degree of secrecy involved for the rights of the individuals concerned. This is so that, where an investigation is current, those involved in illegal behaviour are not forewarned as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have just said, it is also essential, as in this case, to protect the rights of individuals who may otherwise be damaged by publication of material from an incomplete investigation or where a prosecution has not ensued. The release of information of this type in this chamber could constitute a gross denial of natural justice to affected individuals, as they could be subject to trial by media and denied the right of the presumption of innocence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government shares Senator Bourne's concerns about the transgression of the rights of individuals that has occurred in these appalling examples of illegal intercepts of telephone calls. We are appalled by it. The government joins all senators in wanting to see these deficiencies in the legislation that have been revealed fixed up, but you do not do it by trampling across the rights of a whole lot of other individuals by demanding that police and prosecution material be handed over to the Senate in a case where the DPP, properly advised, has made a determination under the processes that work very well in this country that a prosecution should not take place. What is now being mooted is that a political arm is to be inserted into this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the Democrats do not count themselves as politicians, but there are a few in here. I think it is a most unfortunate request&mdash;not typical of the Democrats, I might add. The aim of the exercise is to get the legislation fixed. Senator Bourne knows that we are proposing that the Director of Public Prosecutions directly appear with the committee to assist in that process. All of that can be done without disclosing prosecution material where individuals are mentioned and do not get an opportunity to argue their case&mdash;and neither should they have to&mdash;in front of the Senate. We are not the courts here. I think at times senators get just a little carried away with the role that this chamber should play. This is not a use of power, Senator Bourne&mdash;it is an abuse. It is an abuse of the rights of individuals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You wouldn't. At times senators do get carried away with thinking that if they have power they should use it. The release of such information would be an extremely dangerous precedent. It would disastrously affect all future police investigations because witnesses and others involved in the process would never be confident that the information that they provided would not end up in the public domain. As Senator Bourne has said correctly and accurately, no such guarantee can be given by the Senate that that will not happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own experience tells me that in camera evidence is made public. In fact, all senators should recall some of the debates that have ensued in this chamber in relation to a number of committees where that has happened. That is why the process of routinely handing a printed statement to witnesses who want to give in camera evidence was instituted. This tells them, quite clearly, the limitations of such guarantees that could be given by the Senate. In other words, there are no real guarantees at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne has said that her reason for the current motion is not that she lacks confidence in the DPP but so that she can be sure that the legislative amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act are adequate. But this is not in fact what is going to happen. Let us have a look at what has happened in this matter. Complaints have been made about possible breaches of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. Those allegations have been investigated by the appropriate authority&mdash;the Australian Federal Police. In accordance with normal practice, the AFP sought the advice from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions about whether charges should be laid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Director of Public Prosecutions personally, and after full consideration of the matter, has taken a decision, in accordance with the prosecution policy of the Commonwealth, that the laying of charges in this case is not justified. It has now been demanded that the documents setting out the evidence, and the reasoning of the Director of Public Prosecutions, be produced in the Senate. The DPP takes the position that it is not proper for the material considered by him to be released for public debate; he is therefore not willing to release this material voluntarily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought it would be blindingly clear that the position taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions on the release of this material is the only proper one. Under our system of criminal justice, the DPP is given the key role of deciding whether official action to prosecute should be taken in the public interest. Because the DPP is given this control, it is appropriate that the results of the investigations of alleged offenders by Commonwealth agencies go to the Director of Public Prosecutions for his decision on whether a prosecution should follow and, if so, what charges should be then laid against the individuals concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The release of DPP and police materials to the Senate leads to only one conclusion: that some members of this chamber, as I have just said, want to take over the role that has been vested in the Director of Public Prosecutions and they want to turn this chamber into a de facto director of public prosecutions. Consider the political implications, the real implications, of this. I am not suggesting necessarily that the Democrats are motivated by this, but this is what they are setting up. A politically motivated inquiry could be launched into the question of whether any alleged breaches of the law should be prosecuted. After any official investigation had run its course, all the material could be brought before the Senate for it to make its own supposed public interest judgment. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly what you want done. The Senate could then make its own supposed public interest judgment about whether and what charges should then be laid. In a matter where the Director of Public Prosecutions, as in this case, has already made a decision, this would involve the Senate determining that the charges were justified, where the DPP had determined that they were not&mdash;or, perhaps an even more startling result, that charges were not justified, where the Director of Public Prosecutions had determined that they were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is an iniquitous request by the Senate. I believe it is an absolutely unwarranted intrusion into proper judicial processes that work extremely well in this country&mdash;extremely well, considering the number of prosecutions that are laid in this country. Controversy and conflict surrounding objections to public prosecutors, whether federal or state, are very rare in this country. The system does work well. It is an unwarranted intrusion to put senators, as part-time directors of public prosecutions, into this process by demanding that this material be laid out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Bourne knows, the government is joined with her in wanting the deficiencies in the act to be remedied and has agreed that the Director of Public Prosecutions himself can appear before the committee to assist the committee with this process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some serious issues are at stake here. I think it is important that the Senate consider carefully what is being proposed. I do not start with the presumption that any senator in this place would wilfully leak documents, even though that might put at risk the reputations of individuals or defame them under parliamentary privilege. Certainly, Senator Collins could point to very few examples of a committee resolving to release material when any fair-minded citizen would regard that as an abuse of process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking here about a precedent that is very limited in its operation. I do not go along with the general proposition that somehow you open the floodgates when you make a decision in a particular instance. In this case you have to have regard to the history of the matter. We are not dealing here particularly with the rights of individuals. Senator Cooney is quite right in saying that the last thing you ever want to do is to have someone's reputation besmirched under parliamentary privilege when their opportunities for redress are very limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking here about good corporate behaviour. That is why we need to examine the history of Telecom. I find it very interesting to look at the sea change in the attitude of the Australian Democrats. For a long time the Democrats gave Telecom the benefit of the doubt, even though a number of examples are on the public record of very cynical and manipulative behaviour on the part of Telecom spokespeople. I lost faith in a number of their assurances a long time ago. The people who have come to see us from time to time pushing Telecom's barrow in Canberra have not always reassured me, I can tell the Senate and, hopefully, Telecom in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very high onus on Telecom to be frank. It is currently 100 per cent government owned. It surely has an obligation to all taxpayers as well as to all telephone subscribers to ensure that its behaviour is utterly ethical and beyond reproach; yet in this instance we have had quite the opposite. Senator Cooney would surely agree that it is odious behaviour to think that a government owned carrier, which happens to be a potential party to litigation, could eavesdrop in order to obtain the dirt on one of the litigants. I do not know the full nature and extent of the telephone tapping. We had denials, which were not worth the paper they were written on, but they were never very specific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I think would emerge from an in camera examination of the material is the full nature and extent of the tapping. From my recollection, in relation to Ann Garms, it was not simply a matter of listening in for a few minutes to see whether or not there was any problem on the line; it was a matter of taping whole conversations and retaining those tapes. If examination of the tapes revealed problems on the line, you would expect Telecom to be in there fixing that line. That is minimum quality of service. There is no suggestion that Telecom ever came to Mrs Garms shortly after the taping and said, `We're here to fix your phone.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did Telecom keep the tapes at all? It may not be a punishable offence to retain the tapes. I do not know what defences Telecom has put forward. It may, for example, have taken the advice of all those high-powered teams of lawyers it always seems to have on tap to simply tell its employees to say nothing on the matter, in which case there may not be evidence to refute the proposition that this was simply being done for maintenance and monitoring purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recall&mdash;Senator Boswell will remember this&mdash;an outrageous example of an agreement by Telecom to provide material or to deal direct with one of the complainants in the CoT cases. That person very shortly afterwards was rung up by a very high-powered Sydney legal firm which basically threatened, intruded into the process, tried to up the ante and make life as difficult as possible. The behaviour of Telecom in the CoT cases certainly is not beyond reproach. There was supposed to have been a fast-track settlement procedure put in place more than 12 months ago. None of those CoT cases have yet been resolved and, as I understand it, any request for FOI materials has been fought tooth and nail. In other words, there has been no willingness on the part of Telecom to even act in its own best self-interest, in terms of public relations, and cooperate. It has always been a matter of dragging teeth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great concern we have in this matter is that Telecom has used absolutely every device available to it to dig up as much information as it could on people it is in disagreement with.

That is why it is important to be able to go back and examine precisely what occurred in this instance. We are talking about one of the largest corporations in the country, a $20 billion-plus outfit. I know we put that figure on it and we were ridiculed prior to the last election. I am sure the government would say it is worth a lot more than that now. It therefore has an enormous market power. Any body in a position of unbridled power is sorely tempted to abuse that power, particularly when it is not only the dominant carrier, but also the only carrier when it comes to local calls. The bargaining positions are grotesquely uneven. That is why it is outrageous that someone in that enormous position of influence and power can behave in such a way towards a subscriber, simply treating the subscriber as though he was an irritant to be squashed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have considered this matter personally because of the public interest generated by the allegations.</PARA>
<PARA>That in itself is an acknowledgment that this is an important public policy issue. Yet after all the work behind the scenes in examining the brief we have a very short letter dated 2 March which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The brief of evidence is a lengthy document. However, I have had the advantage of a written report on the case prepared by a senior lawyer within my office. I have also had regard to written advice from experienced senior counsel.</PARA>
<PARA>He does not even say that they agree with him; he just says that he looked at what they have had to say. We do not know from that letter anything about what Telecom's actual behaviour was. All we have, presumably, is some legal analysis of whether it measures up. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view, there is insufficient evidence to prove the relevant interceptions.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us know what the evidence is and that committee can judge whether it is insufficient. I do not want it to be second-guessing. I want it to be able to examine Telecom's behaviour and see what really did go on here. That is the only way you can ensure that you have good legislation for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for the minister to say, `The DPP is happy to come along and offer advice and be as helpful as possible about the future.' You cannot do that without regard to the past. Where you have a long track record, as Telecom does in this case, of doing absolutely everything you can to frustrate the processes then I for one am not prepared to accept that its behaviour should not be subject to this degree of scrutiny. That is why it is regrettable that if the DPP was not prepared to at least outline some of the matters that he regarded as insufficient for prosecution, someone else should have done it. In other words, the minister should have taken the opportunity to indicate what behaviour of Telecom's fell short of prosecution, but nonetheless was not behaviour of which the government approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote to Mr Kerr on 8 March. I have had no reply. Again, Mr Kerr is in a position to have done something about this. The Democrats and the opposition have raised this matter on many occasions. Mrs Garms's case has been aired constantly in the media. I have never heard one word from the government, even expressing its concern about covert behaviour of Telecom. All we have had, as I recall, is perhaps the odd cheap shot about the politics of the issue. I have not heard any concerns expressed by the government. It may well be concerned for the future, but if you judge the government's attitude by its past behaviour, then it is at best benign neglect and at worst culpable negligence. Certainly I do not believe that we should simply rule off the page, sweep the matter under the carpet and assume we will end up with good legislation for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is necessary and important to go back and examine some of these cases and see to what extent Telecom was acting in the public interest. This is not to re-run legal cases; I do not have any reason to doubt that what the DPP says is right. No-one is suggesting that he had an overwhelming case in favour of prosecution but he nonetheless chose not to. What we do not know is just what is there in relation to Telecom's behaviour. As I say, if they are advised to say nothing, there may be very little. But I would have thought there would be quite a lot there that would be very useful in judging whether Telecom does genuinely act in the best interests of its customers and whether more steps need to be taken to ensure that that happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, it may be that in future all telephone interceptions other than those authorised by a judge for criminal tracking purposes should result in there being a beep on the line so that people know this is occurring and they can then contact Telecom and find out whether it is taping the calls. I think there is a lot more that we need to understand about the current technical processes as well as the policy approach of Telecom before we are in a position to make sensible judgments about legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, I think the behaviour in relation to potential litigants is simply outrageous. With regard to the taping of calls, whilst it can be pleaded that they were done for the purpose of monitoring, it rings very hollow indeed. There has never been any suggestion that faults were detected. We do not know on what basis Telecom chose to intercept those calls in the first place. We have just had general assurances that this happens as a matter of routine in many cases. </PARA>

This is not an exercise of trying to obtain evidence about a matter which they are in doubt about. Senator Bourne's speech today was full of certainties.

The victims in these matters are the ones that are most tragically dealt with. They are the ones that have had to bear the cost of criminal activity against them. Today we have people&mdash;they gave evidence last night&mdash;who have been tortured by what they have been through. What I am getting at now is how politicians use them.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to prosecuting decisions in individual cases, that is obviously a different matter for reasons which are well established in the House of Commons, but no doubt we will come to that.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, he did come to that later. It is worth reading what he said. Sir Patrick Mayhew continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Royal Commission, which after all the Committee will remember was the Royal Commission whose report led to the setting up of an independent prosecution service, the Crown Prosecution Service, at Paragraph 651, the report said: "The decision to prosecute or not of its very nature can involve the interests and reputations of witnesses, of the victim and of the accused or suspect. Publicly calling into question a decision not to prosecute could amount to a trial of the suspect without the safeguards which criminal proceedings are designed to provide."</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules of evidence are the great safeguards for people put on trial.

How can you use this evidence as a means of informing the mind of the Senate, which is going to decide upon this legislation, and yet obtain it in camera? That is what is being said here: put it before a committee; put it in camera. And yet the justification for calling it forward to the Senate and, presumably, the House of Representatives which will also vote on this legislation, is that this evidence should be available for senators and members so they can exercise their minds. How can members of the House of Representatives and the Senate exercise their minds on this legislation if the evidence is given in camera?

We want that evidence that was put before that committee brought out in the open so we can see whether that committee did the right thing'? Or are we going to get another committee to look at the legal and constitutional committee, and if that does not turn out all right are we going to get a third committee?

We've got to get at this DPP', for the first time in this parliament's history and for the first time in the history of any parliament of a similar sort. So there is some real concern about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Patrick Mayhew goes further and a particular suggestion is put to him by Mr Crowther, a member of the House of Commons:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am suggesting it would actually be in the interests of the innocent party as well as the interests of this committee if this information were made public.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is the big invitation: it would be better, says the person cross-examining or examining the Attorney-General over there; there is the poisoned chalice that has been offered to him, that it would be in the interests of the innocent parties, he says, as well as the interests of the committee, if this information was made public. So what does the Attorney-General say? He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Crowther, I hear that suggestion and I do not think it incumbent upon me to express agreement or disagreement. What I do, however, reiterate is that it is extremely important that where somebody has not been prosecuted&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>where somebody has not been prosecuted&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or where a prosecution has been discontinued against someone, the evidence that would have been available had that prosecution continued should not be paraded in public. There are other reasons; I have given the first one and I think by itself it is sufficient but there are other reasons which I think also engage the public interest. One is that of confidentiality. When a potential offence is being investigated, evidence is given and statements are made by people on the understanding that the evidence is going to be made public, if public at all, in the context of court proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is very important that the confidentiality should be maintained because if it is not, people will be less inclined to come forward in some circumstances and give evidence if they know that, notwithstanding the fact that there is no prosecution, it will be made public. There is a further ground. It is, I think, of less importance but it is not negligible. It may be that further evidence comes to light which would make it proper to prosecute, would bring it within the parameters of the Code for Crown Prosecutors, would give rise to a realistic prospect of conviction. If, before that stage, evidence has been made public in the circumstances that you have in mind, a subsequent prosecution might very well be prejudiced.</PARA>
<PARA>What is being said there is that, if, after evidence becomes available which may form the basis of a prosecution, that prosecution may not be able to proceed because the evidence has been paraded in public and dealt with in the way that it has been dealt with here today, with due respect, it would be unsafe to proceed to a prosecution because it would be unfair on the person who would otherwise be prosecuted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee system of the Senate is a magnificent system and it has the ability to get evidence. At the meeting last night we had four people from CoT who I thought conducted themselves magnificently given the strain that they are under. They gave their evidence straight and fair and I thought they provided this chamber and the other chamber with the sort of evidence it would need to legislate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the need to go to the DPP for evidence that we can get ourselves for the purpose of legislation? What is stopping us from conducting our own inquiries? Why should the DPP give us evidence that really has not been identified? What is being said is that the DPP must have a reason for doing what he is doing and therefore it would be interesting to see what led him to take that course. But what is there beyond that sort of speculation which justifies our setting a new precedent not only for this chamber but for this parliament and for similar parliaments around the world?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would we pass an act setting up the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in 1983 and 12 years later circumscribe that by doing the very thing that that legislation was aimed at avoiding: bringing into this chamber decisions of the DPP so that they can be dealt with politically? Why are we so much wiser than our predecessors 12 years ago?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine was there then. I am not sure how he voted, but I would be surprised if he was not a person who was determined to ensure that prosecutions were to be brought at the instance of the DPP&mdash;and that was up to the DPP to do&mdash;and that the refusal by the DPP to bring a prosecution or the decision not to bring a prosecution should be respected. It was up to him to make that decision divorced or quarantined from political influence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here we are going into the office of the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and we are demanding that he produce documents that are essential to the decision. No matter how it is put, we are second-guessing. As Senator Alston said, he formed the view that there was insufficient evidence. It is up to the committee to say whether it thinks there is insufficient evidence. The whole of the argument put today by those supporting Senator Bourne's motion has been that those are the arguments of a prosecutor, that they have not been the arguments of a legislator looking for knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the most interesting aspect will be the reading of the speech by Senator Bourne. As I said, it was a brilliant closing speech. Senator Alston also made a speech. What they are saying is that the CoTs people have been terribly treated. Nobody denies that; but if we are going to legislate in an emotional atmosphere looking at one particular point of view, if we are going to get people in here, put them in the gallery and address them, that is not a proper way of going about the task that we must address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the fact that the parliament has the power and that this chamber might have the power to do certain things does not thereby justify the doing of it. We are guided here by conventions. We have to proceed as a parliament and as a chamber on the basis of wisdom, decency and right judgment. That is all that will stop us from becoming tyrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that parliament can become despotic. I have a quote here from Mr Justice Molesworth, an eminent judge in colonial days in my state of Victoria. He began his judgment in the case of Dill v. Murphy with the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first section of the Constitution Act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Constitution Act in Victoria&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in its terms gives the legislature of Victoria the same unlimited powers over its subjects as those possessed by the Imperial Legislature over its subjects. The power of the Victorian Legislature is, I apprehend, subject to the control of the Imperial Legislature and I see nothing absurd in this despotism within a despotism.</PARA>
<PARA>If Senator Bourne wants to go ahead and exercise the powers of parliament simply because she has them, so be it. If she wants to ignore and destroy the structures of this parliament that her predecessors have set up to try to make this place less despotic than it might otherwise be, to quarantine prosecutions away from this place, so be it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you think that that great principle of civil liberties, that great principle upon which we establish the sort of society we want to live in, that great principle of having the bringing of prosecutions separate and the DPP being kept absolutely inviolate from this chamber should be subservient to the principle of the Senate being able to search anywhere for some evidence which you say you cannot get by the proper means through the committee system, and if you say that that great principle is worth sacrificing to get some evidence to justify the conclusions you have already drawn, so be it, but it does not fit well with your undoubted reputation as a person who is very conscious of and has done much for the freedoms of Australia. </PARA>

What I am saying is that, in pursuing that course, you are bringing into this place some very bad precedents. You are destroying, unfortunately, an institution which since 1983 has been operating very well. You will get to the point where this place becomes as it were a court, second-guessing what the courts do, second-guessing what prosecutors do, and doing that without the stops on them which make what they do fair. We are not burdened with the sorts of protections that are given to citizens by placing these stops on the DPP. He has to go about his task in a particular way and do it with a sense of fairness; we do not. There is no obligation on parliamentarians to act with justice or with fairness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was comforted by what I have just heard from Senator Cooney in that he acknowledged that Senator Bourne's intentions in this matter were quite honourable. That was in slight contradistinction with what Senator Collins had accused Senator Bourne of, and that was the misuse of power; that we in the Senate had power and therefore we would use it&mdash;almost an accusation of using power for power's sake. I do not think that is the case at all. In fact, nothing that Senator Bourne has said in this particular debate or elsewhere, to my knowledge, has exhibited that tendency at all; probably quite the reverse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate is dealing with some very important issues. One of the issues is the role of the Senate and its committees vis-a-vis the executive and the judiciary. Another, to which Senator Cooney adverted, is the importance of upholding the principles of natural justice, including, in this particular case, natural justice for persons who have been aggrieved by the actions of Telecom and the protection of the rights of the accused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go to the first point, which is the role of the Senate and its committees. I do not think that anybody in this debate would deny that any senator, including Senator Bourne, is motivated by anything else but a desire to ensure that the Senate, through its legislative power, does its best for the people of Australia. So it is in this particular instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion is designed to assist the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in its consideration of the Telecommunications Interception Amendment Bill 1994 by having laid before it certain documents. A key function of that Senate committee is getting the material, evidence, information and opinion that will assist us in our examination of that bill which, by the way, we will have to examine next week. So this motion is rather critical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That committee is exercising, as it were, our expressed representative function. It is doing for us a very important job. We will have to do it ourselves, of course. Each one of us, I assume, has been the recipient of material relating to CoT cases and will do our own work on this matter. But, to a certain extent, we rely on committees, such as the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, to help us in our representative function. That committee receives representations from people likely to be concerned with the legislation, hears their views, gets evidence from them, prepares its report and reports back to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go to the issue of natural justice and protection of the rights of the accused or people likely to be accused of a criminal offence. As Senator Cooney said, the wording in paragraph (1) of the motion relates to what would be a criminal offence. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there be laid before the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee . . . the following documents relating to allegations that Telecom employees illegally intercepted telephone conversations.</PARA>
<PARA>If they have done it illegally, then they are susceptible to having an accusation brought</PARA>
<PARA>against them and being taken through the court system. I am concerned, as we all need to be, about the rights of Telecom employees as persons who are likely to be accused and against whom allegations have been made. Those allegations have been considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions and have been investigated by the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anybody, including Senator Bourne, has criticised the DPP&mdash;quite the contrary. We are asking for the written consideration by the DPP and his senior staff of the AFP brief of evidence, the legal advice provided to the DPP by senior counsel, the summary report which forms part of the AFP's brief of evidence and the advice by senior counsel to the AFP. As I understand it, Senator Cooney is saying&mdash;I have to take a fair bit of notice of Senator Cooney, the Chairman of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and a pretty good lawyer at that; I do listen to what he has to say on these matters&mdash;that, in each of those subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d), there will be identification of such a nature that it would be easy, if the material got out, to pinpoint particular employees of Telecom. Bear in mind that the DPP has decided that there is insufficient evidence to mount a successful case. That is my understanding of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, I feel that to demand that information would offend against the principle of natural justice. It would offend against that principle to the extent that it related to our responsibilities to the persons against whom allegations have been made and in respect of which the DPP, with all the resources at his disposal, has said that there is no case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those circumstances, it is a very difficult situation. It would not, in my view, advance the Senate's consideration of the legislation by demanding that material. Senator Bourne's motion in paragraph (2) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all documents received by the committee under this order be treated as evidence taken in camera and be returned to the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), unless the committee, after hearing evidence from the Minister and any other persons, orders that the documents be published.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and to honourable senators that you have a look at page 108 of the standing orders. Under `Procedural orders of continuing effect', point No. 10 at page 108 says what precisely is meant by the disclosure of in camera evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go on to that, I take the point that was made by Senator Cooney. As he said, the Senate committee gets this material. Why? It is in the motion: `to assist the committee in its consideration of the Telecommunications Interception Amendment Bill 1994'. That is why it gets the material that is sought. What is the use of getting that material if it is not going to have some sort of effect on the consideration of that bill and, through the committee, some sort of effect on how the Senate will consider that particular legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we to do with the evidence? Do we just keep it in our minds? I am a participating member of that committee. Do I just keep that evidence in my mind? That then influences my decision in a manner that I cannot divulge to the Senate at least in some general way. That is rather strange, I would have thought. In any event, in relation to the disclosure of in camera evidence, under the heading `Procedural orders of continuing effect', point No. 10 in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Standing Orders</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That a dissenting Senator who wishes to refer to in camera evidence should advise the committee of the evidence concerned, and all reasonable effort should be made by the committee to reach agreement on the disclosure of the evidence for that purpose. If agreement is not reached, the dissenting Senator may refer to the in camera evidence in the dissent only to the extent necessary to support the reasoning of the dissent. Witnesses who gave the evidence in question should, if it is practicable, be informed in advance of the proposed disclosure of the evidence and should be given reasonable opportunity to object to the disclosure and to ask that particular parts of the evidence not be disclosed. The committee should give careful consideration to any objection by a witness before making its decision. Consideration should be given to disclosing the evidence in such a way as to conceal the identity of persons who gave the evidence or who are referred to in the evidence.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that gives a fair degree of latitude to a dissenting senator. To me, it does not necessarily give that same sort of latitude to a committee, although inferentially it does since the order indicates that committees have powers to decide certain issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A question arises in my mind as to why the committee does not demand from Telecom the material that it might wish to receive to assist it in its consideration of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill. There are certain questions. Very serious allegations have been made about eavesdropping. Eavesdropping simply means a clandestine listening to people's private conversations. That sort of activity should not be condoned unless it is in very specific circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have to be convinced about when we are dealing with this legislation next week is what those circumstances are in which that sort of activity becomes not an offence. Clearly, most people would say that it is in general an offence. But what are the exceptions? In any event, if the interception is for monitoring and repair purposes, why are tapes being kept? A number of questions come to mind. Obviously, they would have come to the minds of those committee members who have been very much engaged in these matters&mdash;not least of whom are Senator Bourne and Senator Cooney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me is whether sufficient information has been supplied by Telecom and Austel. That is an area that perhaps has been completely canvassed by those more intimately connected than I am with this matter. The final paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) That the Minister release, to each complainant who alleged that his or her telephone calls were intercepted, extracts from the AFP brief of evidence and the DPP's findings which deal with his or her complaint.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is eminently reasonable. As I understand it, the minister said that, if the people make freedom of information requests, they will be dealt with expeditiously, and the FOI fees will be waived. That is a victory. I congratulate Senator Bourne on this; at least she has got that out of him. I think that is what the people are entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the Democrats and to the opposition to consider adjourning this at some stage to have another think about it. It  worries me. Normally, I would be standing in my place to support the orders of the Senate for the recovery of documents from the executive. But, on this occasion, there are some principles&mdash;other than the need for the Senate to have all of the information&mdash;that would militate against voting for this motion. Uppermost in my mind are those principles of the roles of the Senate and its committees and the need to uphold the principles of natural justice. </PARA>

A couple of years ago, I approached the Australian Democrats and said to them that there were some very serious problems, and that I believed we should jointly take action in the Senate. The Democrats rejected my approach at the time. We were all given assurances from Telecom that at no stage had there ever been any interception on the telephones of the members of CoT. We received comments that&mdash;this is a paraphrase&mdash;the CoT members were all a little emotional because there was a downturn in business because of a credit squeeze, and that they were looking for scapegoats to blame for the downturn in the business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am always a particularly careful person, because I am great believer in the theory that if it is a stuff-up or a conspiracy always back the stuff-up. When people approach me with problems I always treat those problems with caution. I have known Ann Garms for many years and I have always found her to be very reliable and trustworthy. Nevertheless, I did seek other information to back up what she was telling me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A meeting was called of telephone users in the valley and about 80 or 90 people turned up. All of them, in front of Telecom, provided information that their telephones were totally insufficient to give them a decent service. That confirmed to me that what Mrs Garms was saying was very relevant and very truthful. As a member of parliament I continued to talk to her&mdash;she being a constituent of mine&mdash;while this debate was going on and obviously in the period her phones were being intercepted. I consider it a very serious offence if I, as a member of parliament and a senator for Queensland, cannot talk to a constituent who has a problem with a government instrumentality without it being recorded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it got worse than that. Mrs Garms is a thorough person and she has very good business ability. She never just accepted what 90 per cent of the people did. She recorded every bit of information that came in. She spent excessive amounts of money backing her assumptions up on technical advice and other information. Through freedom of information, Mrs Garms was able to prove that her telephone was intercepted. The messages and information that came from those telephone interceptions were then passed on to Telecom's solicitor in an action that she was taking against it. So Telecom was leaking information to its solicitors that would act in a detrimental way against Mrs Garms. I consider that totally unacceptable. </PARA>

Senator Short, in passing, heard them coming across the television. He said that it may be that with the slur of my voice or a mistake of my mind I have given the people of Australia the impression that I was talking about Senator Baume.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am very pleased to hear Senator Cooney say that it is not Senator Baume who is the scum in here, it is me. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) told us that we are second-guessing the DPP, and I believe Senator Cooney said this as well, and setting ourselves up as&mdash;he did not quite say a star chamber but that is what he meant. That is a complete and utter load of rubbish. It is absolutely outrageous to suggest that we want to review the DPP's decision not to prosecute. Nobody said that. We do not want to review what he has done. We believe he is a good DPP, and that is why we want to see what he has to say. We want to hear everything he has to say. The actual purpose of this motion, which is spelt out clearly in the preamble, is to find out whether the DPP's decision and the AFP's evidence warrant further amendments of this act. This is all related to one act and to a bill to amend that act which the Senate is looking at now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extremely disappointing, after the constructive discussions we have had with Ministers Lee, Lavarch and Kerr on this issue, to hear this alarmist and misleading nonsense being offered by the minister as a serious contribution to this debate. I should mention in passing one point that we all seem to have forgotten, notwithstanding the inflamed rhetoric of the minister. The DPP should never, of course, be entirely beyond the review of this parliament. Honourable senators will recall that last year we forced the government to admit that the DPP had wrongly advised the AFP that a search warrant could not be executed on Telecom. The minister surely does not seriously suggest that we should never question the actions of the DPP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should not be too precious about this. It should admit that in this case we are in no way trying to review the decision of the DPP. No-one has ever said that. No-one in this debate has said anything about the motives of the DPP, about his conduct, about his character&mdash;anything other than the highest regard for the DPP&mdash;and I do not believe anybody would. We have confidence in his judgment. Our concern is not with his judgment; our concern is with the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister claimed that we want to drag the names of individuals out into the public. That is absolutely outrageous. Almost two weeks ago we told Ministers Lavarch and Kerr that we accepted the need to remove information identifying individuals from the documentation before it is submitted to this committee. They said, `Thank you very much for that; that is very useful.' We even offered to put that requirement into this motion. We are still happy to do that. If the government wants to move an amendment, we will vote for it. We do not want to see individual reputations destroyed on hearsay. That is outrageous. Of course we do not, and we never have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins made a number of points about confidentiality and they just do not hang together. In one breath he said that committees cannot be trusted to maintain confidentiality and in the next he said that the government was happy for the DPP to appear before the committee. You cannot have it both ways. The government knows full well that senators will handle information of this kind with great care, particularly given that so very few of them will get to see it. I can see people sitting around here, smiling to themselves. Who do they think will not handle this information with great care? Would they like to point out to me the people who will not handle this information with great care? Of course they will handle it with great care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins also claimed that I acknowledged that the material could be made public but he failed to mention how. Under this motion it would require a vote by the committee, which is controlled by the government. We are talking here about a legislation committee on which the government has three of the six positions and the casting vote of the chairman, my friend the very honourable Senator Cooney&mdash;and he is a very honourable person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney has nothing to fear. He is the one in the driver's seat. Senator Cooney said that the Senate cannot exercise its judgment on the bill if the evidence is in camera. Senator Cooney has, in effect, moved a vote of no confidence in himself. He chairs this committee. I have great confidence in him. I have great confidence in what he would get out of this. I have great confidence in our own representative on this committee, Senator Sid Spindler. This is a small but representative committee of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that all legislators must see these documents but that a small, representative sample committee of legislators in this parliament should see them. This is too vital an issue for us to simply trust the government's word that its legislation is good enough. We have a duty to discover that for ourselves. If the committee decides that the public interest would be served by the publication, then that publication will happen. It will have to be the government which decides that, however, because the government has the numbers on this committee. If not, then we will just have to trust the committee's judgment and I, for one, am quite willing to do that. I do not want to see another committee looking into what this committee does, on and on forever, as Senator Cooney said. That is an outrageous assumption. Of course I do not want to see that. Who would want to see that?  It would not just have to be me. It would have to be me and a majority of senators in this place. That is rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney also claimed that the committee can find out what it needs to know without the information in this motion. He knows very well that this information is more vital than any other evidence that the committee can possibly hear on this bill. It is the missing link. We need it to deal with this bill&mdash;not to put the DPP through the wringer but to deal with this legislation. Senator Cooney claimed that I have prejudged this issue and somehow I cannot be trusted with this information. I do not deny that I am persuaded that these things have happened in the past, and I am not alone in this. Austel knows that Mrs Garms was taped without her consent; Telecom itself has admitted it. Let me say that again: Telecom has admitted it. That may not be enough proof for Senator Cooney or the government but it is enough for most reasonable people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with Senators Collins and Cooney is that they have no background in a long, drawn out and unique dispute. Senator Alston and Senator Boswell are quite right when they say that it took me a long time to come to this position, that I gave Telecom the benefit of the doubt for a very long time. I did, and I have now come to the conclusion that, in fact, you have to look very carefully at what Telecom says it is doing versus what it is doing. I do not know if that is still happening and I will not know if that is still happening until I hear from my representative on this committee, who will have looked at whether that is still happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However much I am persuaded that malicious interception is happening, Senator Cooney's claim that I am therefore trying to play prosecutor is a red herring. That is most certainly not the point of this motion. The point is to see what needs to be done to tighten the act&mdash;we are talking about legislation here&mdash;if anything needs to be done. If the DPP's evidence is that the act is not deficient, then we will have to take that into account. But that is for the committee to judge. The DPP is not a legislator. The DPP is not used to dealing with legislation; members of this committee are. This is our legislative duty. We are trying to do our job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been quite an extraordinary debate. I have been abused in this place by the best. I recall during the Gulf War debate Senator Ray getting up and saying that I was something akin to Hitler because I wanted an extra six months to pass before we sent in the troops. I thought that was pretty outrageous but, my goodness me, I have never been called despotic. I have never been called drunk with power. I do not think Senator Collins quite said that I was drunk with power, but he was not far away from it. I think that is an absolute outrage to everyone in the Senate. Goodness me! Look at me. Drunk with power? My God! Despotic? I thank Senator Cooney very much. Senator Cooney is my friend, I might add. If my friends are saying this about me, what are my enemies saying?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been quite an extraordinary debate. I believe very strongly that we would not be destroying the axis of the world as we know it by passing this motion. If we pass this motion, these documents will go to a small, representative sample of the Australian parliament&mdash;a small, trustworthy, representative sample of the Australian parliament. I trust Senator Cooney, who is the chair of that committee. Others may not; I do. I trust Senator Spindler, who is our representative on the committee, and I trust the other members of the committee. I see Senator O'Chee sitting over there. He is on the committee, too. He is entirely trustworthy in this case. There is nobody on the committee whom I would not trust to look at these documents and not broadcast them to the world. I do not believe that would happen. The people who are on the committee will have been told by the Senate: `You are not to go and broadcast these to the world,' and I do not believe that will happen. I do not believe the world will end if this motion is passed. I sincerely hope the motion is passed. </PARA>

In this context, the committee notes that it was not Senator Woodley who raised the threats as a matter of privilege, which he might have chosen to do if he had felt himself deterred or obstructed in the performance of his duty as a senator.

It is not a bill that one could say is being rushed through; it was introduced into the House of Representatives on 8 December 1994. On 29 November 1994 it was not considered urgent, but the view is that it is important, as an admittedly small but significant part of the Australia Remembers program, that we get this bill passed prior to Anzac Day 1995. I would be surprised if there was not widespread support for that proposal here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we seek the passage of the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1995&mdash;and I will not go through what is in the bill&mdash;is that we want the new agreement to have effect for the new income tax and FBT years. It is a bill which generates benefits for Australian business. If the bill is not passed, the benefits to Australian business will be deferred for a full year. That would be a problem for trans-Tasman trade in the meantime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The third bill is the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. The main purpose of the bill is to improve the operation of provisions which allow certain former members and senators who re-enter parliament to repay lump sums paid previously and to receive recognition of prior parliamentary service. There has been a lot of consultation, particularly with the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley). The bill was introduced on 2 February. It has received bipartisan support. I think the view is that it should get early implementation so that the benefits can be made available. </PARA>

It includes a rewrite of the substantiation rules and makes a number of changes to the rules to make it easier for taxpayers. If the changes are to be operated from the date intended, we want these changes to apply to this current income tax year. Therefore, we need the authority to put them in this year's Tax Pack as advice to taxpayers, including senators. Senators will remember that there has been some controversy in the past when the Tax Pack presumed parliamentary support for amendments even when such amendments had support of all members of parliament. If they had been included before the passage of the bill, that would have been a cause of concern. The early passage of the bill is critical, as the Tax Pack is currently being finalised. We cannot proceed in the way we and I think the Senate would wish unless we get prompt passage. </PARA>

If this principle were taken before a bench of a court which was trying to interpret what we meant, it would not necessarily think that repetition of the same point recurring in the law was meant to simply repeat that point.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes the amendment. The reason why the standard 15-day disallowance period was not adopted was that the determinations concerned are not standard delegated legislation; they are internal appropriations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, they do not become operative until after the period of disallowance has passed. This is unlike other delegated legislation, which normally becomes law until disallowed by parliament. I think that explanation is clear on the face of it. I reinforce it by saying that, while it may appear to reinforce current practice, it imposes, in a specifically different set of circumstances, on the Commonwealth and on its agencies a considerable hardship. If the moneys cannot be spent until such time as the disallowance period has expired, when normally one would want to have access to those moneys immediately, it renders the operation of agencies almost impossible and in some cases impossible. For those reasons, because they are internal appropriations and because the Senate does not wish to delay the operation of the administration of government unduly, we oppose the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are seeking to omit all of clause 36 from the bill. This clause provides specific authority for ministers to approve reward payments for people who provide information that leads to a conviction for an offence that involves actual financial loss or detriment to the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have always given particular emphasis to issues of accountability. I believe that the practice of giving financial rewards to whistleblowers sets a bad example and sends out all the wrong messages to people who have considered blowing the whistle on financial fraud or mismanagement. In short, it does not help to create an effective internal process of accountability. Senators may be aware that the Privacy Commissioner, Kevin O'Connor, has expressed strong concerns about this clause which he voiced in a letter to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach which the government is putting forward in clause 36 has been explicitly rejected by the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing. It was also rejected by the 1993 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into fraud on the Commonwealth. The Queensland Electoral and Administrative Review Commission also came down with a similar finding in 1991. Financial reward is a cornerstone of the system surrounding whistleblowing in the USA. But it was specifically rejected by many of the whistleblowers themselves when they gave evidence to the Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr William de Maria from the University of Queensland, who has undertaken the largest study of whistleblowers in Australia to date, described the system in the USA as a bounty hunting arrangement. He said that rewarding whistleblowers is an incorrect and dangerous inducement on which to expect people of goodwill to come forward. They should come forward on the old-fashioned basis of just being ethically disturbed by what they see. The Australian Democrats agree with that sentiment and hope our amendment to delete this clause has the support of other senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to Senator Woodley, and to the question from Senator Gibson and I will answer that in my remarks. The government opposes this amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with very real pleasure that I take this chance in the Senate to give a brief account of my wonderful experience as a guest of the Australian navy in going in a submarine out from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> naval base into the Indian Ocean and staying on board for 27 hours. I think this was the first time any Australian parliamentarian had had the opportunity to see at first hand what submariners contribute to the navy and, indeed, to all Australia. They are an essential part of the defence of this, our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It came about that, as I have in recent years had a number of opportunities to visit the Australian navy, army and air force&mdash;and in particular having, I think, very successfully visited destroyer escort HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torrens</EMPHASIS> in the Pacific Ocean off New South Wales for 24 hours&mdash;I was invited by the navy to go out on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Orion</EMPHASIS>, one of the six Australian Oberon class submarines. I began by arriving at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> naval base in Western Australia where all of our submarines are soon to be based and where the new Collins class submarine will be based. This is an appropriate strategic decision by the Australian government which has bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was met by Commander Rob Partington, the commander of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS>. He was in great spirits because this is his last posting. About this week he will be retiring from the navy after a lifetime of marvellous service to this nation. He was so happy because his last posting has been at this expanding, increasingly modern equipped naval base near Perth. He was able to show me around the base. I had been there before and was able to see a number of the new developments. One item which is quite marvellous is the new pier. It is a two-decker pier that can service both submarines and surface ships. With every facility within the pier in terms of electricity, water, offices, telephones, cables and data&mdash;it also has a crane on top and has the ability for trucks to move about the pier at the lower level&mdash;it is a first-class facility for a modern naval base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also saw the new submarine training school, which is still being built and which is already switched over to Collins class submarines. There is a simulated submarine there in a massive hall. All of the commands of those operating the submarine result in a movement in the actual physical structure they are in. The movement is exactly the same as if they were descending at an angle or rising. It even has the swell interacting with the simulator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also visited the submarine escape facility, a six-storey building&mdash;the best in the Southern Hemisphere&mdash;which has within it a tower of water where there is continuous training for all submariners, divers and others that need to be familiar with safety measures and, indeed, to physically handle diving to considerable depths.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I didn't actually, Senator Cook, put on the suit that is required but I saw it and had it all explained to me&mdash;that the oxygen comes from a tap into that suit and then, with that bubble, you naturally rise to the surface of the water. I must move on quickly, as I was so happy to have seen these new developments at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling </EMPHASIS>base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was able to meet the commander of the Australian Submarine Squadron, Captain Denis Mole, and I have great respect for his contribution to the Australian navy and not least his time as a submariner. He now has the great responsibility of being the commander of all Australian submarines at the time of transfer to the Collins class. I wish him and all those who serve under him the very best success, particularly in these few years. I had breakfast with him and also with Commander Michael Deeks, the commander of the particular submarine, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Orion</EMPHASIS>, which I then boarded at 11 o'clock that morning. Commander Deeks has had a very similar training and range of experience to Captain Mole and I felt in the safest hands with these very reliable officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happened to be accompanied by Commander Stuart Tapley, who is responsible for logistics supply not only to submarines&mdash;the job he had when based in Adelaide&mdash;but now, more generally, to the navy at large. He was coming on board a submarine&mdash;this amazed me&mdash;for the first time in his 24 years of naval experience. So he was just as excited as I was to be a guest of the 85 crew of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Orion</EMPHASIS> when we boarded, and we stayed on board for 27 hours. We went through a range of exercises in the deep water off the Western Australian coast until I was lifted by a cable to naval helicopter and then brought back through Moora to Perth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention the other officers serving on board <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Orion</EMPHASIS>: the `Exo' as he is called, the executive officer, Lieutenant Stephen Dalton; the electrical officer, or `Eo', Lieutenant Albert Eenink; the operations officer, also called `Weo', the weapons electrical officer, Lieutenant Brett Sampson; another weapons officer, Lieutenant Ross Halsall, who was familiarly and very affectionately referred to as `Torps' because he had expert control of the torpedoes on board; and an officer called `Sonic', the officer in charge of the sonar, who I am pretty sure was Lieutenant Brett Sampson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there was Lieutenant Timothy Brown, the navigating officer. It was interesting to note that he was a fully qualified engineer who not only worked on and understood the engines and power systems of the vessel but had very successfully added skills to be a navigator. He did an excellent job as we left <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> along a channel which then took us into the Sound and out to the open ocean. Lieutenant Martin Kuhn and Lieutenant Rodney Brown were officers under training on board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee was saying to me earlier, `Surely there was a coxswain on board the boat?' I said, `These days, that person is called COB, chief of boat, because I think he has duties other than coxswain.' I was very happy to meet Chief Petty Officer Vernon Hancock and the other two chiefs responsible for engineering, Chief Petty Officer Anthony Bernhagen and the Deputy Electrical Officer, Chief Petty Officer Ross Fitzgerald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were about 12 petty officers on board and I spent an hour and a half in their mess, the place where they eat and sleep. It is about half as big as my bedroom at home but it accommodates some 14 people&mdash;sleeping, eating, watching entertainment or reading a book in that one space. That is typical of the 64 standard crew on an Oberon class submarine. They sleep on what would in ordinary circumstances appear to be shelves, but they have adapted themselves to be ready to sleep in what some would call coffin size sleeping areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went through a number of exercises on the ship which I was delighted to observe from the command centre of the submarine. There were two periscopes, a sonar system, a weapons system, a navigation centre, and the controls for all of the air pressure and air into tanks are right there in that central area. Then there is the steering mechanism of the submarine which is like an aeroplane's joystick, but it is actually called a one-man control stick or an OMC. I had the pleasure of being invited by the captain, after proper instruction, to sit at the OMC and actually steer the boat to port or starboard to whatever was the commanded degree and direction and also, with regard to elevation, by pressing forwards&mdash;quite a physical effort&mdash;to then dive the submarine or to pull back and so elevate the submarine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through various exercises we went to 600 feet. I remember being given a command to take the submarine down to 200 feet and bring it back up again to 180 feet and to do so at a particular elevation not exceeding 10 degrees, and so on. When I was not in command of these controls we went through an exercise&mdash;and this is a realistic exercise because there are occasions when you need to get to the surface with emergency&mdash;where all air is pumped into the ballast tanks of the submarine and a 20-degree elevation and force thrust on the engine takes the submarine to the surface very rapidly. I was able to look out of the periscope when we arrived at the surface to see the great swirling and bubbling white ocean behind us where the air had reached the surface with the submarine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into describing the various items of equipment that I have alluded to nor the lower level of airconditioning pumps, lighting equipment and so on. But I make the point that there are two diesel V16 engines on board and each would be about 20 feet long and stand about five feet high. They can only be turned on when they are what they call snorting, that is, when the exhaust from the engines is able to go out freely to the surface. There would be all manner of catastrophe if the submarine, while snorting, were to dive below the surface, because all of the exhaust airs would flood the submarine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of highly critical points in the management and command of such submarines. We dived very quickly at one stage. We did all sorts of what were described to me as angles and dangles, all of which realistically test this submarine's capacity to defend Australia. I will continue my remarks in the adjournment debate this evening. This was a marvellous experience. I point out that I am wearing the dolphins badge that I received with great honour from the officers. These are normally only worn by fully trained officer submariners. It is with great happiness that I speak about my experience on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Orion</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators may recall that late last year in this chamber we debated the legislation which introduced the new widows allowance for women who were widowed, separated or divorced after they turned 50. At that time, I moved a number of amendments designed to make the allowance fairer and more widely available. Unfortunately, those amendments were defeated by the combined vote of the government and the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following that defeat, I decided to initiate a petition in order to show the members of this parliament just how much concern there really is out there in the community for the position of widows. The petition calls on the parliament to make the widows allowance available to women in their 50s who were widowed, separated or divorced after they turned 40, to pay the allowance at the pension rate and to provide all the pensioner concessions to these women. The response to that petition was enormous and this morning I tabled over 10,000 signatures on the petition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my contribution today, I want to put a human face on this issue because if ever there was an issue which demanded a humane response then this is it. I think it is important for the Senate to see how the eligibility criteria for the widows allowance is actually affecting women in the community and to see the great personal difficulty some of the women who contacted me are enduring. At the outset, I acknowledge that my petition did not go as far as some women would have liked and I hope that in the future we can built on that work to accommodate some of the other concerns that they have raised with me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the petition was first released just a few weeks ago, my office has been inundated with calls. Some women rang up simply to say that they would do anything to help the campaign. Some women phoned because they were angry at the system and bitter that they are to be condemned to another 10 or 15 years on an unemployment payment. Some women who phoned were literally at their wit's end and desperately needed to talk to a sympathetic ear&mdash;often these conversations ended with those women in tears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is impossible to listen to the stories these women had to tell without being affected personally. That is why I feel it is important that the Senate sees the human aspect of this issue and I will do that by quoting from some of the letters I received over the last few weeks. Many of the letters spoke of the inequity of the requirement for eligibility for the widows allowance that a woman had to be 50 years or older when she was widowed, separated or divorced. I will read to senators some of the extracts. One woman wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was 49 when I lost my husband&mdash;just over 3 years ago&mdash;and I cannot see that I am any better off than the person who is 50. Politicians do not realise the frustration and embarrassment of going around asking for work at this age.</PARA>
<PARA>Another woman wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After caring for my husband for 12 years he passed away in May 1994&mdash;I was 49 years of age. Since then I have turned 50 and, thinking I would get the allowance, it was a slap in the face to be told "no". It's very degrading going from a wife pension to lining up every fortnight and having to show you've looked for work just so you can get money to live on.</PARA>
<PARA>Another woman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was left a widow at the age of 47 years and after spending my married life looking after my sick husband and my three children, I was told that I was not eligible because I was not 50 years old, and that I would have to find work. I was shattered by my husband's death and then not to be accepted as a widow made my life seem not worth living.</PARA>
<PARA>Another woman wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First let me say that the age of a woman when she loses her spouse cannot be decided by anyone, including the Minister for Social Security . . . I lost my partner before I turned 40 and was left to care for our three children alone. When my youngest child reached 16 years, I was put on the dole. I know that I can lodge my Newstart allowance form every 12 weeks, but this is really no comfort to me.</PARA>
<PARA>Another woman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the age of 49 years and 10 months I was divorced. Over the past eight years I have had emotional problems and I am currently receiving treatment. I am unemployed and I have a negative outlook of getting back into the workforce. Women my age should not be forced into the workforce when there are so many young people unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>Another woman wrote to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it would be fair to say that the majority of people in the community are not even aware that widows are treated in three different ways depending on age and when their husband's happened to die. I'm sure if a wider range of people were informed of these injustices many or even all would support our cause. If my husband had died before 1987 or this year then I could receive some kind of pension . . . Most women who are widows would prefer to support themselves if they could but it would be nice to know that if it was impossible to get a job they could get some acceptable support.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet another woman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was widowed at age 43. I am now 49 years of age and because my youngest child has now turned 16, I am forced to go into the work force . . . The situation has been extremely emotionally and physically draining because my family still need me to be available . . . and I have found that by being home for them has helped them to overcome and adjust to the loss of their father.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, one woman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . work is very hard to find at my age of 51 years and as I was told at our local CES office, once you turn 50, you are classed as "unemployable!" but still not able to receive any sort of pension, apart from unemployment benefits . . . Social Security did send me a form last September which I filled out and sent back return post, regarding this Widows Pension, hoping and praying the pension would go through but my hopes were soon shattered when I received a letter saying I was not eligible as I had to be 50 when my divorce went through.</PARA>
<PARA>A good number of women who wrote to me made the point that most of their friends simply assumed they were receiving a widows pension. One woman wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was widowed in 1985. We had one child and my husband was rather proud of the fact that he chose to support me and our child. I haven't been in the work force since 1958. I find myself at age 57 years being on the dole&mdash;what an embarrassment and a struggle financially. I will not be able to get names on the petition because I am too ashamed to tell people that I am on the dole, people just assume I receive a Widows Pension.</PARA>
<PARA>Many women reported that being made to look for work when they were in their 50s was a tiring and often demoralising experience. For example, one woman wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have to go to the CES twice a week to look for jobs, they look up their computer for any type of job for me. I have 40 jobs in my book which I went and looked at, same old thing, I'm too old, they want young people.</PARA>
<PARA>One group of women I heard of did not have the courage to go into the CES on their own so they used to arrange to go as a small group or at least in pairs. Many women complained about the case management system of the CES. One said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have to attend regular interviews with the CES and they can do nothing for me. I was once told by a staff member that I would never get a job due to my age.</PARA>
<PARA>Another woman wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had been out of the workforce for 25 years when my husband died very suddenly and was 49 and a half years at that time. My main concern is filling in the fortnightly forms and being constantly in touch with the CES and being told that I have to be retrained. I would like to see far more young people getting these opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA>Another woman wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been to other courses the CES have arranged but they haven't helped. It is rather humiliating being the oldest in the group and finding out you are the only one not to get a job at the end especially when my results were higher than some. I am now almost 52 years old and find myself almost begging for work only to be told "We would prefer someone younger". The only time I get a referral from the CES is to do another course, never a referral for a job.</PARA>
<PARA>Another woman wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even though I am 53 years old now I am still being faced with the trauma of case management and activity testing. Even though I fill in the reduced reporting form I fail to understand the meaning of Widow Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA>One 54-year-old woman sent me documents in which the CES said it would cut off her payment if she did not attend an information session for a work force orientation course despite the fact that this woman had already done that particular course as well as a number of other courses after being directed to by the CES. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case management was particularly a problem for many women in rural areas. One woman wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was disappointed when I was refused the allowance because my husband died when I was 48. I am now 54 and haven't been in the workforce for 30 years. I find it very distressing to have to look for work and recently had an interview with a case manager to be told I have to do some training courses to get experience. I live in a small country town where there are never enough jobs for younger people let alone for those of us in our fifties.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately for some women, this whole process has been too much to cope with. One woman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have recently been separated after 17 years of marriage, and 17 years of home duties, only to be flung into the circus of the Social Security system&mdash;because of depression and stress I am currently receiving a Sickness Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA>Another woman wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was told I would have to register with the CES and claim the jobsearch allowance. I did get as far as registering with the CES, but found the whole procedure so stressful on top of everything else, that my doctor has declared me unfit for work, and I am now having to claim a sickness allowance, which in itself has added more stress. I am 53 years old and prior to all this, had not worked formally for 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, a widow wrote to me to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My husband and myself paid lots of taxes to help others in their time of need. Now I need help and I feel as if I must beg for it.</PARA>
<PARA>Many women returned their filled petitions with a little note attached simply saying, `Thank you for caring.' The Democrats certainly do care, and I feel it is time the Senate showed some more compassion and amended the widows allowance. In closing, I indicate that next week I will be moving an amendment to the Social Security Act to relax the eligibility requirements for the widows allowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the matters of public interest debate today I will seek to revisit the forestry debate. The forestry issue was a matter that took up some considerable time in this chamber earlier this year especially when there was that substantial blockade outside of Parliament House. The blockaders at the time had a very just cause; they still do. It is vital that the people of Australia and indeed this parliament do not lose focus and do not lose sight of the ongoing struggle that this industry finds itself in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of issues need to be addressed and a number of factors indicated to the Australian people as to the importance of this industry to the well-being of our fellow Australians. First of all, we as a country still import huge quantities of timber and timber products. That might be hard to believe but that is a fact. That of course impacts on our overseas debt and our balance of payments, which have been blowing out, going through the roof, every consecutive month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the forestry industry provides a renewable and environmentally friendly resource. It grows naturally, can be cut down, harvested and regrown. Thirdly, the forest industry employs literally hundreds of thousands of people in Australia and in particular in the depressed regional areas of Australia that have suffered so much under the economic mismanagement of the Labor government. Indeed, in my state of Tasmania, the forest industry employs one in seven people. That of course is a very important industry to my state. Within the economy of Australia and each of its states, the industry plays a very large and sustaining role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it is common to hear people talk about the profitability of the forest industry, it is good for us to remind ourselves of the actual costs associated with the industry and the taxes that are taken out of the industry. For example, let us have a look at the taxes that one log truck that travels 110,000 kilometres per year generates. As I understand it, that is a fair and average sample. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, in the year of purchase there is a one-off tax of about three per cent stamp duty, $6,000. If the truck travels 110,000 kilometres per year it will use about 55,000 litres of fuel. Fifty-two per cent of the retail price is state and federal taxes. Therefore, about $20,000 worth of fuel tax is paid into the economies of the state and federal governments each year. Tyres, the trailer and other items that are required to be repaired or replaced attract a 21 per cent sales tax. Remember the outrage by those opposite at a 15 per cent sales tax? They are imposing a sales tax on this industry of 21 per cent on these parts which, on average, cost the log truck operator $3,500 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the driver who drives the truck? On average, he pays $10,000 in personal income tax to the federal government. The registration of the truck and trailer is $1,548. The sales tax that is imposed on other spare parts varies from truck to truck but I am reliably informed that it is about $1,500 per annum. We then have to look at the forestry road tolls that truck drivers pay. On average, they pay $25,900 per year and on the state road tolls they pay a further $5,900 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those expenditures add up to $74,343 per annum that is going to state and federal governments out of each and every single log truck. If we take off the $6,000 stamp duty, which is a one-off cost at the beginning, we are then left with a figure of $68,000. In anybody's language that is a huge and substantial contribution to the economy of this country and its various states and that $68,000 is from one truck and driver. There are literally thousands of those trucks all around this country. It is vitally important that in this debate about the forest industry we do not lose sight of the very real benefit of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech from Senator Woodley just now about the reduction in the age requirement for widows pensions was a very heart-rending account and one that, undoubtedly, we would all wish to be able to provide and assist with. Why has it not been assisted with? Because of lack of funds. Let me say very simply that if the Democrats continue with their outrageous attack on the timber industry there will be fewer taxes gathered by the federal and state governments and, as a result, there will be even less money available for those who are genuinely in need that Senator Woodley referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has really hurt this industry that is so vital to this country is the on-again, off-again approach that the government has taken to the industry. We had the 1,300 coupes recommended by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) and the 85 adopted by the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall). The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) comes in and says, `We'll have 509 coupes logged.' We then have another review as a result of the blockade. There is just gross uncertainty within the industry, and that uncertainty is hurting and hurting badly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debates a month or so ago a number of us made the comment that there would be unemployment as a result of the federal government's dithering. To date, that has not been given much publicity, but there is genuine concern and compassion within the small industries that operate within the forests of our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to refer to a few sawmillers in Tasmania and how they have coped despite the incompetency of Senator Faulkner and the Labor government. McKay sawmill in Triabunna has six employees. It was out of logs resulting in stopped production twice, each for part of the day. It almost ran out of logs a further three times. When the workers are cutting up the last log, what does that do for their economic security? How do they feel when they go home that night? Will there be another log there in the morning? In fact, will there be a job for them? What about their families? What about their children?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clennet's sawmill in Dover has 15 employees. It lost orders due to a lack of supply of mature logs. J.A.R. sawmill at Forcett has 10 employees. It was out of logs for five days, during which time five men were stood down for three of those days. That was on the 13th, 14th and 15th of this month&mdash;only a very short time ago. Muskett sawmill at Orielton has 10 employees. It was out of logs for four days. Two loads of logs in late January were in fact reloaded from another mill, Harback's sawmill, at Midway Point and redirected to the Muskett sawmill to assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of cooperation that these normal competitors who are out there fighting for a market are willing to give each other, to assist each other, in this time of great need and uncertainty created by only one group of people, and that is the federal Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dean's sawmill at Whitefoord has seven employees. It was out of logs for three or four days. The Booth sawmill at Karanja with 10 employees was out of logs for 10 days. What did the employer do? The sawmill was able to keep the employees working on maintenance around the mill&mdash;racking, building and other odd jobs. So it deliberately sought ways of retaining its employees to bear the brunt of any economic hardship that might otherwise fall upon them. So, simply, had it not been for the goodwill of all concerned, the situation would have been much worse and, without doubt, many more stand-downs would have been inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore vitally important that we do everything we can in this house and in this parliament to assist the industry. When we talk about the industry&mdash;and it is worth repeating&mdash;we are talking about small businesses like the small sawmillers that I spoke of who have six or 10 or 15 employees. It is the very essence of small business that we hear Senator Schacht rant and rave about in this place nearly every second question time, about the wonderful things that this government does for small business. He ought to visit the sawmillers in my state and all around Australia, and he will see what he and his government are doing to the small businesses of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a view within the community that when you talk about the forest industry what you are really talking about is woodchipping. There is this misapprehension that all timber harvesting goes into woodchips. That is demonstrably wrong, and it has to be repeated time and time again so that people understand the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit like the farmer who has a field of oats. He heads the oats, but you then tell him he is not allowed to cut the rest and market it as straw. Or you tell the beef producer, `You can sell the meat, but you are not allowed to sell and make use of the waste products&mdash;the hide, the hooves, the blood, the bones and the intestines.' It is silly and stupid, but it is the same in the forest industry. People are saying, `Use those parts of the tree that are good for sawlog, use those parts of the tree that are good for veneer, and then just leave the rest of it lying on the ground and let it rot or let it burn.' If there is a market for it, why not allow that waste to be used for the benefit of workers, their families and their communities and, at the end of the day, to lessen the huge foreign debt that this country suffers from?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicated my concern about the forest industry having been misrepresented as only being about woodchips. Today I was absolutely disgusted to receive, courtesy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, the National Folk Festival brochure, because on the cover is a map of Tasmania with a huge pile of woodchips on it; and that, allegedly, represents Tasmania. That is the outrageous stereotyping that is occurring about my state and about the timber industry generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth while remembering, Mr Acting Deputy President, that your home state is in fact the featured state for this National Folk Festival. South Australia is the featured state. Let us have a look. In Tasmania, we have 27 per cent of our land mass, over a quarter, locked away forever in world heritage areas, national parks and reserves&mdash;27 per cent. What about South Australia? We have 0.0003 per cent of the land mass of South Australia in world heritage area. Why pick on Tasmania, which has the highest percentage of world heritage area of any state in the Commonwealth and, indeed, of any country in the world? Tasmania has the proudest record in that regard, yet we have these people associated with the National Folk Festival peddling this nonsense about the forest industry and the woodchip aspect of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly galling when you see that one of the sponsors of the National Folk Festival is none other than the CFMEU, the union that allegedly supports the forest workers. Its name is on this document. The forest workers of Australia need to realise that their union fees have funded this outrageous document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At 12 noon yesterday, the bankrupt New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party had its debt with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia increased to a little over $10 million. This was made up of its mortgage of around $6 million, secured by a building worth less than $2 million, and overdraft facilities of a further $4 million, secured by the expectation of its receiving $3 million or so in election funding. I will restate that: at 12 noon yesterday, the New South Wales ALP's debt with the CBA had risen to a little over $10 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only because of this extraordinary generosity from the Commonwealth Bank that the New South Wales ALP has been able to massively outspend the Liberal Party on advertising in the state election campaign. However, it is evident that the New South Wales ALP is technically insolvent, with its liabilities hugely exceeding the value of its assets, and is surviving only because of the generosity of the bank and other creditors&mdash;particularly the union movement, one of whose most senior members is a board member of the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;who are owed about $4 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises a very serious question for directors of the Commonwealth Bank relating to its responsibilities under the companies code and also for the directors of Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd, Messrs John Della Bosca and Terry Sheahan. It is an offence for directors to continue to trade while knowing their company is incapable of repaying its debts as and when they fall due. How can the New South Wales ALP pay its debts when it clearly lacks the necessary security? I understand the bank has already made a request that the ALP's federal property in Canberra be provided as additional security over this debt in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 31 March, just a week after the New South Wales state election, the federal ALP will decide whether to provide this or other interventionary help to the bankrupt New South Wales Labor Party. Before the state election next Saturday, voters in New South Wales should be made aware that the New South Wales Labor Party cannot run its own finances, let alone a state government's finances. There are the examples of WA Inc. and disastrous Labor governments in South Australia and Victoria to confirm the fact that you cannot trust Labor with money. Unless there is federal ALP intervention, the directors of Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd&mdash;that is, the bottomless hole into which the Labor Party's money has been dribbling; the Commonwealth Bank's money has been dribbling; and, as the Commonwealth Bank is the people's bank, I guess the people's money has been dribbling&mdash;know they can only continue in business with the support of their banker, the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I wonder is whether the Labor Party's auditor, Farley Meyer James &amp; Co., has made that particular qualification to the accounts of the Labor Party or the accounts of Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd. I ask that question because, as far as the files of the Australian Securities Commission are concerned, there are no accounts on which that sort of qualification could be made anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have dealt with the failure of the Labor Party and its wholly owned disastrous subsidiary Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd to meet the basic reporting requirements of the Australian Securities Commission. It is also reasonable to wonder whether the auditors have advised directors of Labor Centenary House that they are only continuing in business with the support of their banker and that they are technically insolvent. If the auditor has, then the directors of that company have a particular requirement to behave in a way that does not, in fact, damage those people who may be induced to lend them money. Not only that; it is illegal to continue to trade if you know you are insolvent and are unable to repay your debts as and when they fall due. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that then needs to be asked is: what about the directors of the Commonwealth Bank? There is a special requirement under section 232(4) of the Corporations Law for directors of a company, that is, the bank, trading with an insolvent company&mdash;it is understood that the Labor Party and its subsidiary are insolvent&mdash;to discharge their duties `with a degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person . . . would exercise'. The New South Wales Crown Solicitor has advised that `a reasonable director or officer would not normally lend money to, or enter financial arrangements with, a company which they believe to be insolvent or expect will be unable to repay its debts'. The penalty is a fine up to $200,000, imprisonment for five years or both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where it gets really interesting, because the bank has already put the Labor Party in the category of being unable to repay its debts, by transferring the debt from its normal accounts into the hands of its group credit control section as a potential bad debt against which a provision for bad debt would be raised. That is what the group credit control section is all about. In other words, the bank has acknowledged that this is a potential bad debt and has continued to trade in the sense of providing an extended overdraft accommodation to the Labor Party in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a real problem, because directors of the bank recognise they are dealing with a company that is unable to repay its debts but they have, nevertheless, allowed the New South Wales Labor Party to expand its debt by $4 million or so to enable the ALP to massively outspend the Liberal Party on election advertising. I hope the directors of the bank have taken legal advice because, in the absence of any assurances from the federal ALP that it will back this debt, the New South Wales ALP is clearly technically bankrupt and the bank's directors run a personal risk in allowing the debt to blow out even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the bank, however, has been privately told that the federal ALP will provide added security, then the people of New South Wales are entitled to know before next Saturday's election that it is really Mr Keating, not Mr Carr, who will own the state ALP. They should know that Mr Carr and his colleagues will be owned lock, stock and barrel by the federal ALP and will have to pay the money back by hook or by crook. </PARA>

I clearly could not imagine that the Commonwealth Bank would have failed in its duty to report any such cash transaction or transactions. Here we have a situation where a bankrupt organisation, the Labor Party in New South Wales&mdash;and Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd&mdash;is waging an election using money it does not have. It frankly has no right to borrow it, as it is already massively in debt, in order to outspend its political opponent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a similar matter to that raised by Senator Baume which relates to the Labor Party and the way in which it is conducting itself in the lead-up to this state election. Senator Baume has quite rightly pointed out the very perilous financial position that the state ALP is in. It reminds one of that expression in politics: if you can't govern yourself, how on earth can you govern the state? That certainly applies to the state ALP in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main matter I want to discuss today arose out of question time yesterday. It relates to the non-answer to my question given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) about the way in which this federal Labor government is manipulating public policy to assist the state ALP government to win on Saturday. This is really about Richo's doctrine of `win at any cost'&mdash;manipulate public policy in any way whatsoever to make sure that you win; that is the important thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans yesterday responded to my question about the three ways in which this government has manipulated public policy. The first relates to interest rates, the second relates to woodchipping policy, and the third relates to the third runway. I want to deal with those three matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a history over the last six months where this government has consistently raised interest rates. The background to this is that it missed its chance with the budget last year in bringing down a responsible budget and in cutting government expenditure at a time when it had room to do so. If the government had done this, it would have headed off a great many of the rises in interest rates. We had a very rapid succession of interest rate rises throughout the end of last year. Now there seems to be a rather strange pause. All the main economic commentators are calling for interest rate rises. They see that the inadequate fiscal policy of the federal Labor government will bring about an inevitable rise. But we are not having those rises, are we? Why not? Because Labor fears it is going to be slaughtered at the polls once people realise that, come Monday, interest rate rises will well and truly be back on the agenda next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second way in which the government has manipulated public policy relates to the commencement of the full operation of the third runway at Sydney international airport. We all realise that completion of the control tower was delayed, and this is the main reason that we have not gone up to the full number of flight movements. But the control tower is now completed&mdash;and has been for some little time. But, guess what? The government is not actually going to open the control tower to its full operations until April. Why? Because there is an election on March 25, is there not? So, to help its mates again, the government is going to put off the increase in aircraft movements which will result from the full opening of the control tower and facilities. They will increase from 60 to 80 movements a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People under the flight path of the airport are screaming for relief from this government's hopelessly inadequate airports policies over the last 12 years. The government had the opportunity to head it off over the last 12 years. It has failed to do that. The people under the flight path are suffering. The bad news for those people is that the suffering is going to increase from next Monday because that is when aircraft movements over these areas will go up from 60 to 80&mdash;an increase of one third. Let us hope that the electors who are right under the flight path in places like Gladesville and Drummoyne realise what the inadequate policies of the federal Labor government have done to them. Let us hope that they give the government a really good thump on the weekend as a result of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area I want to deal with relates to the approval for logging in certain forest areas. At last this federal government has quite rightly approved loggings in a number of the state forest areas. But guess what has happened in New South Wales? There has not been any logging. The minister claimed yesterday that the reason for that is delays by the New South Wales government. Today I want to expose that as the absolute lie it is. Minister Souris in New South Wales has contacted the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) nine times in recent weeks about this issue. Jim Snow from the Eden-Monaro electorate of New South Wales has blown the whistle on this one. He admits that New South Wales has provided ample information. Meanwhile, jobs remain in doubt. In Moruya, on the south coast, a sawmill is about to close because of this uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gavin Hillier, the New South Wales State Secretary of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union has said that Carr will not win and that his members will not vote for him because he is too weak. In a desperate media conference, Mr Carr promised to sign his election promises in blood. He does not really need to do that. I suggest that, like his mate Paul Keating, he should try to say that he will make it l-a-w, law. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this Saturday the New South Wales Labor Party will be judged by these types of manipulations that have been put forward&mdash;win at any cost. We have a situation in which Mr Carr is showing up as a one-man band. The clumsy effort by the federal government to conceal bad news is something that the voters really should weigh up on Saturday. I believe that the people of New South Wales are waking up to the ALP's Richo doctrine&mdash;win at any cost. I think the ALP tactic of stalling on vital issues at the expense of the wellbeing of the people of Australia is now crystal clear.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first opportunity I have had to take issue with the response Senator Evans gave yesterday in question time to a question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Richard Alston. It is quite obvious that the ALP in this chamber is trying to throw mud at the Premier of New South Wales even in circumstances where the issue is outside the premier's control. I must say that Senator Evans has a good public record of accuracy in responding to questions. However, I think it is unfortunate that yesterday afternoon, in election fever and in his haste to make a point before Saturday's election, Senator Evans's understanding of superannuation law did prove to be defective in his vain attempt to lay blame at the feet of the New South Wales Premier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response was really about a nominal, or paper, loss of the New South Wales government's superannuation fund arising from a decline in property values. I remind the Senate that investment of superannuation funds is not, as Senator Evans alleges, the prime responsibility of the premier; the responsibility for the investment of superannuation moneys rests with trustees, who in turn may appoint managers to seek balanced portfolios in superannuation funds. That is the first point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second misleading point is that the New South Wales government superannuation fund lost a significant amount of taxpayers' funds. This implies to most people that there was a disposal of assets resulting in a loss, whereas the loss is, in fact, a paper loss based on a valuation due to a decline in property values. I believe Senator Evans's answer was a good example of an emphasis on what I term short-termism. Senator Evans failed to recognise that there is a need to look at superannuation from a long-term perspective, not in terms of short-termism and making political points in such an environment. Superannuation is similar to an investment in your own home&mdash;which may be the most significant investment or asset a person will have. I suggest that if you valued your own home nominally every month and looked at the interest rates movements, you would have a lot less sleep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I want to make is that Senator Evans's response adds to a growing scepticism in the general community about the value of superannuation. There is no point in the government spending millions of dollars&mdash;I think an extra $300 thousand was committed in the last budget&mdash;on educational campaigns designed to improve people's understanding of and confidence in superannuation when the Leader of the Government in the Senate effectively undermines people's confidence in superannuation, which he did yesterday when he attacked nominal property loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the minister did not bring the Senate up to date. Property values, since he was provided with that information, have significantly changed resulting in an improvement in the overall values of the superannuation fund. I believe he should have brought the Senate up to date in relation to the updated values. After all, they are only nominal values rather that realised ones. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few words about Internet, which most people who follow communications issues and increasingly the general media would recognise as the quintessential example of the information superhighway. We have a Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who likes to fancy himself as someone who is up to date in that area. When it comes to parliamentarians having access to the Internet, let me simply say that what we have at the moment is no highway, it is more a goat track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this building there have been endless discussions, various trial projects, pilot projects, interdepartmental discussion groups&mdash;almost everything but access to the Internet for parliamentarians. Of course it is a two-way street. Many people out in the community would very much like to be able to contact their parliamentarians. Internet is a constant fact of life in the United States. Every member of Congress without exception would have not only an e-mail address but also access to the Internet. People send them great volumes of messages in this manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to something that was posted on the Internet by an ANU subscriber. He said, `I can listen to Bill Clinton's voice, but not Keating. I can hear Bill Clinton's cat, Socks, miaow. Worse, you can send Socks messages on the Internet, but not the Prime Minister of Australia. I can e-mail a cat, but not a single member of the government or the opposition or my local member.' He goes on to point out that you are able to obtain a considerable amount of information about the Australian economy via the Internet and the source of that material is the CIA. I do not know whether that is accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are something like 30 million users of the Internet worldwide and in excess of 600,000 Australians who already have accounts. The Internet is growing exponentially&mdash;something like 10 per cent a month. It is an uncontrolled network in many respects, but it is the wave of the future. There are very many people in this building who would like to be able to surf the Internet. At the moment you have to go to the Parliamentary Library and if you are lucky enough to get access to one of five personal computers you can take your turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It just shows how far behind the real game we are and how hollow the Prime Minister's rhetoric is. If he wanted to demonstrate that we were really up to the pace and that Australia could compete internationally with the rest of world when it comes to information technology, this would be the obvious and classic way to do it. Yet, unfortunately, we are bogged down with bureaucratic turf battles about who ought to be responsible. I know the library is very keen to accommodate parliamentarians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really makes me wonder how committed the government is to providing all members of parliament with access to government information. If the Prime Minister's previous behaviour is any guide, then we can safely assume he does not believe he ought to give a sucker an even break; that the government and ministers have all the access they need, thank you very much and why should any of that be made available to the opposition. If that is not the case, then I would certainly like to hear an argument advanced as to why we are so far behind the rest of the world in what is really a showcase example of the information superhighway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is becoming a very tiresome bit of violin playing on the part of the opposition. There is no foundation for taking the government's position on this at other than face value. We have said all along that to the extent that we do have a problem with the current account deficit and to the extent that we do need to increase domestic savings in order to not have that call on overseas capital, we do need some intense attention paid to the fiscal side of the equation and we will be doing that in this particular budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course I am not ruling them out, and no responsible government would and I haven't. No responsible government could or would. But hopefully that won't be necessary. The latest figures in terms of the housing market suggest that the economy is in fact slowing down in a number of respects as many commentators have also, apart from those mentioned, been prepared to concede. If we can avoid interest rate increases, obviously we would want to do that because of the impact that interest rate increases do have in particular on home buyers, as well as on larger questions of investment and business decision making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the truth of the matter, Mr President, is that the economy is in good shape. The growth that is occurring has been the kind of growth that has made it possible for us to produce over 500,000 new jobs in the last two years as compared with the election commitment about which you were so sceptical two years ago. We promised 500,000 jobs over the course of the three-year life of this parliament. That generated some horse laughs and guffaws from the other side at the time. It was thought to be an impossible objective but, not only has it been not impossible, we have produced it in just over two years in office. That is an outstanding result because we have reduced the unemployment rate below nine per cent, with a participation rate at the moment that, had it been prevailing in the early 1980s, would have had unemployment running at under five per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the nature of the government's economic achievement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, it is true that New Zealand's recent economic performance has been impressive but I emphasise `recent' because New Zealand's economic performance over most of the last decade, not just 10 years ago, has been absolutely lamentable. It had much higher levels of unemployment and much lower levels of industrial and commercial activity than has been the case in this country, with many New Zealanders having to come to Australia to seek work as a result because of the deeply depressed condition that that economy was in.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last couple of weeks have seen two major developments in Turkey: first, an outbreak of sectarian violence in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir and, secondly, in the last two days a Turkish military operation in northern Iraq against PKK targets. As to the sectarian violence, the Australian government is very concerned about the recent outbreak of that kind of violence in Turkey involving members of the Alawite community. The Alawites are a very significant minority in Turkey comprising about a quarter of the entire population of 60 million people. They are members of a Muslim order opposed to an upsurge of religious fundamentalism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned, as are many others around the world, that the events of the last week have resulted in over 20 deaths and almost 500 injured, including protesters and police. The troubles began back on 12 March when gunmen in a taxi opened fire on three coffee houses and a bakery frequented by Alawites. Those attacks were followed the next day by street demonstrations involving clashes between police and some 2,000 demonstrators. The unrest spread through the cities that I have mentioned, with several thousand demonstrators clashing with police in Ankara on 14 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the announcement made by Prime Minister Ciller on 15 March to set up an official inquiry into the outbreak of this violence. Although at the moment we have no details of the scope of that inquiry, we would expect it to examine, among other things, whether the police and troops did in fact react appropriately to the situation with which they were confronted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have discussed the events of recent days with the Turkish government and have expressed our views, through my department, on the desirability of a government inquiry into these incidents. We will continue to closely monitor the situation, because we do recognise the very real concern which is felt by the Turkish community in Australia over these recent events. We certainly hope that this state of unrest will be quickly redressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the military offensive against the forces of the Kurdistan Workers Party, this followed an ambush of a Turkish military convoy by Kurdish rebels in eastern Turkey on 18 March, which left 15 Turkish soldiers dead and 25 wounded. As I said in this place last year, the Australian government, while recognising the real threat that the PKK does pose for Turkey's internal security, urges Turkey to exercise restraint in its fight against terrorism and to do all it can to bring a lasting peace to the south-east region of the country. In particular, we do urge the Turkish government to ensure that its troops return to Turkey as quickly as possible and that, more importantly, the lives of innocent civilians are safeguarded.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, relates to the government's tough new penalty provisions on social security payments which were introduced in December last year. Has the department issued a national instruction to all DSS staff recommending that people suffering hardship because of the new penalties should be referred to welfare agencies?

Given that the resources of most welfare agencies are already stretched to the limit, will the agencies be provided with any additional resources to assist them in dealing with these people?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I think the senator knows, and certainly the Senate knows, the government has intensified its help to unemployed people through individual assessment, through case management, to better meet the needs of individuals and through guarantees of work with the job compact. In return, the government expects the unemployed to accept a reasonable offer of work or assistance or to face suspension or cancellation of their income support. This is, I suppose, described best as reciprocal obligation. That reciprocal obligation emphasises the partnership between the government and the unemployed to move closer to full employment. In all cases, persons on unemployment allowances are warned in advance that their payment will be stopped and a deferment period applied if they breach this reciprocal obligation&mdash;for example, by refusing to take up a job or suitable work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true, as Senator Woodley says, that the Department of Social Security issued a national instruction in December last explaining to staff the changes to the Social Security Act in relation to deferment periods and advising that no social security payment will be available to persons in hardship during a deferment period and that those persons indeed may be referred to welfare agencies for assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is also important to note that the department has its own assistance for people who are going through hardship, and indeed people may be able to stay on that hardship provision arrangement through the department, particularly if they appeal against the decision for deferment. So while people are under appeal they will be able to continue their payment and will be able to continue to receive assistance through the department. So there are two ways in which people in a deferment period, and particularly those facing hardship, are assisted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the last point that Senator Woodley raised about whether or not the Department of Social Security is now depending on welfare agencies in a way that has not been done before, no, that is not true at all. The government has had a long-term cooperative arrangement with the relative and geographically near welfare agencies whereby people have often been referred from the Department of Social Security for the appropriate assistance that welfare agencies can give and the Department of Social Security cannot&mdash;housing would be one example. That arrangement between the department and welfare agencies has been in existence for a long time, and these deferment arrangements simply build on that arrangement between welfare agencies and the department.</PARA>

Minister, can you simply deny that the Federal Airports Corporation has considered, or is considering, the feasibility of the construction of a fourth runway at Mascot which could run parallel to the two existing north-south runways? Is such a runway seen by the FAC as the means of coping with the extra demand that will result from the year 2000 Olympics? Isn't this why your government has consistently failed to take any meaningful action with regard to the development of the Badgerys Creek airport?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do have some information from the minister on this. I do have some awareness of this as well because I live on the beach near the Patawalonga, and I can remember that last year, on the two days which were sunny enough to go for a swim on the beach, the Patawalonga had been cleaned out and no-one was able to swim safely in the whole coastal area around Adelaide. I think that is something Senator Coulter would be aware of and something that needs to be taken into account when assessing the particular problem of the Patawalonga. The fact that at high tourist periods people cannot swim on Adelaide's beaches is obviously of concern. It is more of a concern because of the health problems that flow from an area like the Patawalonga. That is why the Resource Assessment Commission's coastal zone inquiry identified the Pat Basin as one of the worst polluted waterways in Australia and that is why the federal government has been involved in the clean-up of the Patawalonga Basin and the catchment area under the better cities program in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

Will the minister make certain that the Commonwealth Bank makes that interest rate available to the many farmers who are in extreme distress? Could he also explain whether the New South Wales ALP will be able to pay, as he says, `every cent' of its debt? Does that assertion depend on intervention by the federal ALP on 31 March, a week after the New South Wales election, when the federal ALP is to respond to the Commonwealth Bank's request for the ALP's Canberra property to be added as security to the New South Wales debt?

<PARA>At the state conference of the Australian Labor Party on 12 June 1993, Mr Carr said `strictly time limited planning and environmental approval processes'. The preamble to my question related to Mr Michael Egan. In New South Wales they call him `You can't stop progress' Egan because he is promising everything. He is promising to bypass ICAC&mdash;for example, in relation to the tendering for the Sydney showground sites, which Senator McMullan referred to in answering a question yesterday. The fact is that the state government in New South Wales has to tender for sites for those types of things because that is a requirement of ICAC. You cannot bypass the rules and the considerations that are in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael Egan wants to return to the old `a wink and a nod' deals that the Labor Party enjoyed in its previous time in government in New South Wales. ICAC has stopped those types of deals. It now ensures that those things are done properly. Michael Egan also said that he will do away with the proper tendering processes. He is also quoted as saying that the EP&amp;A act would be bypassed if anyone got in the way of any major investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I wanted the minister to do today was tell us directly whether or not he agreed with that.

Yesterday the minister, in replying to a question by Senator Kernot, said that the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act was very firmly set in concrete and it could not be bypassed. </PARA>

<PARA>The minister made the point that we are very much a part of a global environment and many global problems affect the way in which we live. Ultimately, that means that there is a requirement for global solutions to those problems. The minister also indicated that the question of environmental policy has been a matter of some debate in this parliament over a number of years. This debate has taken place during estimates committees and in this chamber. Over a long period, Senator Kemp has indicated in his public statements his attitude towards the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of important elections are coming up this weekend, and the question of the environment is looming very large. It is very important that this parliament notes the position of the opposition in respect of these matters. The minister indicated quite clearly the contrast between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party in respect of these questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp has indicated to us that he is opposed to the Basel convention on trade and disposal of hazardous waste.

In fact, he is opposed to almost every convention that you would care to name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears to me that what does not seem to have sunk into minds of members of the Liberal Party at the moment is that there are certain environmental issues, of which climate change is one example, which cannot be effectively advanced without international cooperation, standards, monitoring and a certain amount of international peer group pressure. The scientific evidence is overwhelming. The seriousness of this problem and other international problems means that Australia must be part of those international conventions. It has been the case for centuries that there have been treaties and conventions between nations and governments for mutual benefit and with a mutual understanding between the parties involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, the coalition's position on international isolationism runs very much contrary to the realities confronting us today. If we look at the question of a world which is increasingly interdependent, we have to examine ways in which we can address environmental problems on an international basis. Of course, those problems are growing in number and complexity. It strikes me as particularly odd that we should have a coalition position being put forward which essentially stands contrary to that fundamental reality. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It strikes me that some of these issues are not confined to matters of state borders.

<PARA>Maybe the minister could not answer the question about the critical differences between the two economies. Let me point out a few of the facts. New Zealand is running a substantial domestic budget surplus currently equal to 0.8 per cent of GDP. It has maintained a strong export performance, with export growth of 14 per cent in the past 12 months. While matching Australia's economic growth, it is currently growing at 6.3 per cent in the year to September last. It has managed a relatively low level of current account deficit equivalent to only two per cent of GDP. Compare that with six per cent here for a similar level of economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I asked the minister was: why can't Australia achieve a combination of strong growth without blowing its current account deficit out to crisis proportions? After all, New Zealand has proved it can be done. It can be done only if the government adopts a responsible fiscal policy designed to eliminate the domestic budget deficit, return it to surplus and keep it balanced or in surplus. Through sound fiscal policies the New Zealand government is proposing to achieve further and increasing domestic budget surpluses in the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compare that with Australia, where we have run huge deficits over the last several years in spite of the fact that our economy has been growing fast. No wonder the financial markets have been confused over the past few years and no wonder the rate of interest on 10-year bonds in this country is now two per cent higher than on similar bonds in New Zealand. Two years ago interest rates in the two countries were in parity. Now 10-year bonds are two per cent higher. That is the extra premium we are paying. The chief economist with UBS, Mr Stephen Roberts, was quoted in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> as saying the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New Zealand is running huge Budget surpluses and they have committed themselves to retiring their public foreign debt in its entirety over the next three years. That's a great comfort to financial markets.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that Australian policy in this area was in a state of flux and that uncertainty about the size of the budget deficit for the next year was deterring international investors from buying the Australian dollar or supporting local financial markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the latest survey of international competitiveness released in September 1994 by the International Institute of Management Development, New Zealand came in ninth. Australia was 15th. Despite high growth rates, the New Zealand economy has continued to contain inflation with underlying inflation expected to be only 1.5 per cent for this current financial year. Ours is looking to be running towards four or five per cent towards the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the above economic program, the New Zealand economy has begun to generate jobs. That country's unemployment rate has now dropped to around 7.5 per cent. In addition to this, the value of the New Zealand dollar has surged over recent months and has appreciated by a huge 10 per cent against the Australian dollar since Christmas. The chief executive of Bankers Trust New Zealand, Mr Gavin Walker, was quoted in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> as saying that the major reasons for the surge in the New Zealand dollar were the new Fiscal Responsibility Act which requires the New Zealand government to be accountable and responsible for its long-term economic policy direction. In addition, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is obliged to take all necessary action to keep the underlying rate of inflation under two per cent. Fiscal transparency, fiscal responsibility and a greater dedication to real micro-economic reform are the only answers to our current economic problems. If New Zealand can do it, so can Australia&mdash;but we need the right sort of leadership. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that the penalty, the stick, was applied some months before the legislation supporting welfare clients, the carrot, came into effect. In any case, the Democrats moved an amendment to do what the minister claimed is happening&mdash;that is, to allow two further fortnightly payments before the benefit is cut off. However, the government and the coalition overturned that amendment. The effect of this is set out very well in an article in `Rights Review' by the Welfare Rights Centre. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the recent toughening of penalties in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Social Security Act</EMPHASIS>, DSS has advised staff to refer breached clients in hardship to welfare agencies. The advice is contained in a National Instruction dated 19 December 1994, the day the Government's tough new administration of penalty provisions was rushed into operation.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is clear what the government was doing. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 19 December 1994, DSS is only required to "give" . . . a notice and the deferment period then immediately takes effect. That means it takes effect before the letter is received.</PARA>
<PARA>I am afraid the minister in her answer was not correct. My question was about the shift of government responsibility to welfare agencies. Those welfare agencies around the country tell me that their client load has increased significantly, if not exponentially. They cannot cope with the additional load. They are having to send clients away. They are having to limit days and times at which clients can come to them for assistance. They are now having to deal with verbal and physical abuse because they are unable to cope with the shift from government to them.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister did not answer my question about whether the government would resource the welfare agencies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to see that Senator Kemp has also supported this motion. There is no doubt that this is indeed a very urgent matter, and it is urgent for four quite important interrelated reasons. Firstly, the composition of the global atmosphere is changing faster than at any time in the earth's history. There is abundant evidence of this; it is a matter of fact, it is not a matter of debate any more. The exact consequences are unknown. However, there is a strengthening consensus among scientists that this will result in temperature rise, climate change, sea level rise, very substantial changes in our agricultural practices, and things such as national parks all being found in entirely the wrong places and, therefore, massive loss of species.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is important because this is the first time that the human species has had such impact on a global scale. While there have been extinctions and desertification in many parts of the world, on this occasion we are talking about global change brought about by human intervention. Thirdly, as I think all senators would know, next week the Australian government will be meeting with other governments in Berlin to thrash out the Framework Convention on Climate Change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly&mdash;and this comes to the nub of this motion&mdash;Australia's record as a greenhouse gas emitting nation is poor, and our record in tackling the problem, even after it was recognised and after targets for reduction of emissions were set, has been absolutely abysmal. For all these reasons, the matter is urgent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone in this chamber must agree with the first part of this motion. Indeed, the government itself has admitted that its strategy has failed to meet the targets it announced back in 1989, that is, the 20 per cent reduction by the year 2005 after stabilisation in the year 2000. The minister has admitted it. The Auditor-General, for instance, found that one year into the strategy it was already a year behind, indicating a lack of any real commitment and support for adequate resources to meet these targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has always given itself an out by qualifying its targets with the proviso that action to tackle the greenhouse problems should not have negative impacts on industry or the economy. Its interpretation of this qualifier has always erred on the side of no action. It has been overly persuaded by those in industry and also by narrow, economic advisers that any effective attack on greenhouse would be damaging to existing industries. It has failed to recognise that action will be forced upon it by the imperatives of climate change whether it likes it or not, and that the longer we as a nation delay the worse the impact will be, not only in environmental terms but because the alternative industries will not have been developed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's record is indeed woeful. On a per capita basis we are among the worst greenhouse polluters in the world. While many other nations have improved their per capita emissions, on the basis of emissions per unit of GDP we have lagged behind. To quote a few figures, the total emissions per unit of GDP in 1990 were 1.92 tonnes of CO(2) equivalent per $US1,000 of GDP. The figure for the USA, which is generally regarded as a bad greenhouse polluter, was only 1.04 tonnes, and Canada 0.99 tonnes. Australia's relatively poor position has become substantially worse over the last two decades. From 1987 to 1992 Australia's energy related CO(2) emissions grew by more than the OECD average&mdash;by more than 13 per cent compared with the OECD average of only five per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest it be asserted that the reasons for our high per capita use of fossil fuels lie in our vast country and the use of these fuels in transport, let me put on the record that compared with the OECD our transport contribution is slightly less than the average. It is not more. We have failed to make a number of changes in the other areas where changes could have been made, and in this failure the federal government has been conspicuous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a nation, we have failed to redirect many industries such as the electricity industry in ways which would have benefited both the industries and the country as a whole. Enormous attention has been given to the electricity generation industry from the economic rationalist viewpoint without any consideration being given to the environmental impacts of this industry. We have seen efforts being devoted to the interlinking of the grid and the break-up of the industry into smaller competing units devoted to generation distribution and retailing. The simple addition of a requirement that the state legislation under which these utilities have operated be changed so that, instead of being electricity suppliers, they or their supercedents become the suppliers of energy services would indeed have had enormous effect. Yet the government has failed to do this. Thus, instead of these utilities being bound by these several acts to supply electricity, and therefore, in a similar way to private industry, being strongly oriented toward maximising their production and sales of electricity, they would and should become the sellers of energy services. Hot water is needed by people, but not necessarily through electricity. The lifetime costs&mdash;that is, the total costs over time&mdash;of providing hot water in this way are cheaper than the total costs of the electric alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has developed is a situation in which the utilities amortise the large up-front capital costs of installing more generating capacity while the up-front capital costs of solar units are being borne by individual consumers. In the intergovernmental agreement on the environment, the federal government could have insisted&mdash;indeed, could still insist&mdash;on this change. It could force the states down this economically as well as environmentally desirable road by insisting that no more heavy generating equipment be imported for fossil fuel generating stations for the next 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many American utilities&mdash;America being the doyen of private enterprise&mdash;have travelled this route and found that the solar option is more profitable than the all electric one. Australian utilities cannot adopt this strategy as long as they are constrained under their various state acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years the WA government made the decision to build a coal-fired power station at Collie, even when all the advice from the environmental movement and from economic advisers has been that this was the most expensive and the least environmentally desirable option. The decision was supported by the previous Labor government and the present Liberal government in WA. But the federal government&mdash;and this is the point&mdash;stood by and watched this happen, even though it could have intervened in the name of both economic and environmental sanity. It has done nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, in New South Wales the utility has extended the grid into the remote north-west of the state, even though it makes neither economic nor environmental sense to do so. A number of utilities in the US have found that it is cheaper to provide stand-alone solar photovoltaic systems to meter the electricity produced and to service the units rather than to extend the grid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the contribution to greenhouse amelioration from this development may be small, the contribution to the newer non-greenhouse technologies developed in Australia would be considerable. Very considerable savings in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions can be made through greater efficiency in house placement, house design and insulation. Has the federal government taken any lead in any of these areas? The answer must be a resounding no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A national planning criterion which takes into account the orientation of housing so as to minimise energy use could easily be achieved through building codes. The federal government should reintroduce tax relief for retro-fitting insulation and insist on its use in new housing. Solar units could attract tax benefits. The government has given no thought to these simple measures which would not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but substantially improve the comfort of ordinary Australians and give support to Australian industry, which must become the industry of the 21st century. And one could go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One finds the federal government encouraging the tourist industry based on international air travel even when the figures are quite clear that that is totally inconsistent with greenhouse targets. We see the failure of the energy car. That paltry $6 million that the federal government put aside in the 1993 budget has not resulted in a single solar hot water unit going into one single house in Australia after some 19 months of operation. We have seen paltry spending on ethanol research and the failure again over some 18 months before any of that money was spent. We have seen total opposition to any inclusion in the car plan of energy efficiency. One could go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think subsidies to the existing energy utilities are important. A recent paper indicates that there has been some $40 billion worth of subsidies going to the established industries since the Second World War, and that is in constant dollar terms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important urgency motion and to a number of issues Senator Coulter raised in his contribution in relation to greenhouse science and potential impacts, which underpin this issue. Emissions resulting from human activity have substantially increased the atmospheric concentrations of certain greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, this century. These increases will enhance the natural greenhouse effect, resulting in an additional warming of the earth's surface.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, estimates that the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide will be 75 per cent to 220 per cent higher than pre-industrial levels by the year 2100. Model calculations indicate that increases in greenhouse concentrations will lead to increases in global mean temperature of about 0.3 degrees per decade. This is greater than seen over the past 10,000 years and is estimated to lead to a sea level rise, increased likelihood of extreme weather events, possible threats to biodiversity, changes in agricultural production patterns and the need for new infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government is concerned about the potential impacts of global warming and is committed to playing an effective role in the global response. A clear signal of the government's concern was given when Australia became one of the first countries to sign and ratify the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Under the convention, Australia is committed to adopting and reporting on national policies to limit emissions and enhance sinks of greenhouse gases with the aim of returning net emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, subject to caveats concerning special circumstances that countries might face. I am pleased to note that the convention entered into force in March of last year and that over 100 countries have now ratified the framework convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to a number of domestic issues, greenhouse issues do cut across a broad spectrum of activities. Greenhouse concerns are especially important in areas such as energy supply and use, transport, land management and urban planning. For this reason it is important to recognise the value of an effective greenhouse response strategy for economic as well as environmental reasons. The government has adopted a national greenhouse response strategy as a first step towards meeting its obligation under the framework convention. The strategy contains a range of measures designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions and enhance sinks, conduct further research, prepare for potential impacts of climate change on Australia and inform and educate the community and decision makers. The government is committed not only to the national greenhouse response strategy as it stands but to working with all relevant parties to further develop a range of measures to advance the strategy. The national greenhouse response strategy is a living document which will continue to develop and evolve. In December the government reaffirmed the importance of an effective greenhouse response program, and it will be considering further measures in advance of the first conference of the parties to the climate change convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering these further measures, we need to take account of our current situation. It is now only five years from the end of the decade. It will be increasingly difficult to achieve outcomes in the year 2000, so we have to consider our options carefully but quickly and be flexible enough to adapt our response program to new and emerging information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to keep clearly in mind that climate change is not going to stop in the year 2000. This is a very long-term problem and we need to have long-term solutions. We must not let any focus on 2000 make us lose sight of the long-term goals. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has also suggested that much larger reductions in net emissions may be necessary in the long term if we are to avert a major interference in the global climate system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a different note, there seems to be increasing recognition that responses to greenhouse need not necessarily be costly; in fact, they can be very beneficial economically as well as environmentally. In the short to medium term, a major focus of any greenhouse response program is likely to be on energy efficiency. By using energy more wisely, industry can save money and can free up resources for other investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general community can also benefit from using its energy dollars more wisely. Response measures in the land management area can have a significant economic spin-off, as they can help significantly in terms of the restoration of degraded lands. In urban planning, measures which reduce greenhouse emissions can also have economic benefit, as they make urban areas more efficient and competitive as well as better and more vibrant places in which to live. I think we need to recognise that there are also potentially serious costs from inaction in this area. These include environmental costs, especially threats to biodiversity, potential costs of lost agricultural production, necessary new investments that would have to be looked at to deal with the rise in sea level and increased health costs. In relation to health particularly, doing nothing could be a very expensive option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Perhaps the most important change that is taking place is a growing recognition that greenhouse response is not a matter for government action alone. While the Commonwealth will continue to have a major role in leading a national response, there is a serious limit to what the Commonwealth government can do on its own. The national greenhouse response  strategy recognised the need for a partnership between all levels of government. There have been a number of recent events which indicate that other governments are facing up to their greenhouse responsibilities, especially in the energy area. New South Wales and Victoria are developing internal markets for electricity by separating generation, transmission and distribution, and by introducing competitive sourcing of both existing and new sources of supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia is considering options to introduce greater competition into its energy market. The WA government recently announced the construction of a new cogeneration power plant at Kwinana, which will use natural gas and result in 60 per cent less emissions than a coal fired-power plant. The largest wind farm in Australia has also opened in WA, saving $650,000 in fuel costs, and a large grid connected photovoltaic power plant has been established. South Australia has made some commitment to have 20 per cent of its energy sourced from renewables by the year 2004. Queensland has recently announced a package of programs designed to promote energy efficiency and renewables. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Over the last few months, the government has been developing a new package of response measures. This has been a difficult and time consuming process which I think indicates the complexity and importance of this particular issue. There has been wide consultation with a group of stakeholders, business groups, other levels of government, the community, conservation groups and the trade union movement. As part of these consultations, industry has indicated a willingness and an ability to take a much stronger role in a greenhouse response program. We intend to work with industry to see that it delivers on that commitment. I think this is important for both the achievement of direct emission reductions and the recognition of the need for greenhouse response to be taken up by all parties, not only by governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We thought carefully about how a greenhouse response program might best be focused. It is expected that energy will account for about 70 per cent of growth in greenhouse emissions from 1990 to 2000. Clearly, this sector needs special attention. The reform of energy markets, which the Commonwealth is supporting, will in itself serve to move towards least cost delivery of energy services. This will have greenhouse benefits. But it is recognised that we will need to ensure that issues such as demand management are adequately handled in market reforms. The Commonwealth is committed to seeing that this occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also be looking at other means, including cooperative agreements with industry, which will increase our energy efficiency and so improve our environmental and economic outcomes. We also recognise the importance that is highlighted in the national greenhouse gas inventory of addressing issues related to land management. The inventory indicated that approximately one-third of total net emissions in Australia of carbon dioxide is for land clearing, although I think the government must accept that there is some uncertainty in relation to that data. We will continue to work on a comprehensive approach to greenhouse in developing further measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is fair to say that Australia has made important progress on greenhouse. I accept that more progress needs to be made. It is important to recognise that looking only at the Commonwealth government will always give a pessimistic picture of how greenhouse response is progressing. This is an issue in which government, industry, other stakeholders and the community all have a significant role to play. The Commonwealth is developing a further package of measures and will be considering it before the first conference of the parties later this month. We will take the necessary time to adequately consider our options, given the vital importance of  greenhouse for both environmental and economic reasons. While cabinet will ultimately decide the precise contents of such a package, I believe it will be a credible and effective package that will certainly take Australia further towards its objectives and targets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to hear from the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) that the government will have a credible package and that it will produce appropriate results in the area of greenhouse. We have been waiting nine months for the minister's package. The government has known for a very long period that the conference in Berlin is to be held at the end of March. Since last year I have asked the government whether it would be prepared to make a statement on this issue&mdash;an issue which everybody agrees is extremely important. We have heard from the government that it will be making an announcement at the end of February, early March or late March. Now we are hearing from the government that perhaps in the next few days or in the next week we will get a statement on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The reason we need to have a ministerial statement on this issue is that it will provide an opportunity for parliament to state its views, and it will provide a useful vehicle by which other groups in the community can make their views known. Senator Faulkner stressed, as I think Senator Coulter did, the need for a cooperative approach in the area of tackling greenhouse gas emissions. I believe the best way to ensure a cooperative approach is to take the Australian community into your confidence&mdash;in other words, make it clear what you intend to do and what your objectives are, build up community support for those objectives, lobby for them in the international arena, then go to Berlin and try to achieve those particular goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not have worded this urgency motion in the way that Senator Coulter has done. I understand and have some sympathy for the concerns that he has because it is a matter of urgency that the parliament debate the greenhouse gas issue. That is particularly so because, within a matter of days, a delegation from this country will be going to Berlin and attempting to negotiate, on behalf of us all, an appropriate agreement. This is one of the few occasions in this parliament that we have had the chance to stand up and get a debate going on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of my contribution I will be seeking to move an amendment to this urgency motion. It is a somewhat complicated process. The one assurance I can give is that I will be brief in seeking to move my amendment, which is designed to ensure that the parliament has an alternative agenda at which to look and by which to express its concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that Senator Coulter, in pointing to the development of greenhouse gas emissions in this country, stressed the special circumstances in which Australia finds itself. It is dependent on fossil fuels. We have a very high growth in population compared with other countries. It is a pity that Senator Faulkner, in his remarks, did not look at some of these special circumstances. He should also have looked at the need for an equitable burden sharing between countries when we finally arrive at a protocol to carry us past the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has conceded that it will not meet the targets set at the Rio conference. I think Australia could have done better. I am happy to say on the record that I believe Australia has the capacity to set an example in this area. Indeed, as I go around talking to business and conservation groups I see an enormous willingness in the community to take a constructive approach to tackling greenhouse issues. I think the community is increasingly informed and a government that was prepared to take the people into its confidence could have gone to Berlin with a program that enjoyed the support of the vast proportion of our people. That will not happen for the simple reason that, because of the policy vacuum of this government, we are still waiting for details of its approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other problems that I have with the motion is the way in which we tackle the global problem. Both Senator Coulter and Senator Faulkner stressed that this is a global problem. Therefore, Australia must be one of those countries to encourage an appropriate global response. While Senator Coulter pointed out that, per capita, Australia has relatively high greenhouse gas emissions, on the world scale we produce only one to 1.5 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia can make a contribution and should take the lead but, at the end of the day, whether we can tackle this issue depends on the global response. I would liked to have seen in this urgency motion a recognition that this is a global problem. Then we could look at what can be done to encourage countries to take part in any future greenhouse response. As I understand it, some 50 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions come from developing countries. It is suggested that this proportion will continue to grow. </PARA>

He said, `Hey, get out there, cut a couple of trees and walk across a couple of rivers or in the rivers.' Hey-presto, we had a caring, sharing, tree loving Labor Party.

As Senator Kemp has said, carbon dioxide is the main contributor to greenhouse gases, accounting for some 49 per cent, with methane accounting for 18 per cent. The only gases that come from the farms are a part of that 18 per cent. So she was up the wrong tree on that one. </PARA>

The committee studied this vexed question for about two years. Having sat through much of the hearings and heard many speakers on the subject, I have no disagreement about the importance of this very difficult problem. As Senator Kemp said, Australia today is only producing one or two per cent of the world's greenhouse gases. A considerable amount of evidence was taken. We heard it from all sides. Actually, nothing much has been done by this government as a result of all those things that were put to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell the Senate something that has happened in New South Wales. The other day, with Senator Loosley and the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, I went to the opening of the new Nemingha public school. That school was identified as a project to embody the most up-to-date principles of environmental design. Significant energy savings are expected for lighting, heating and cooling. Computer simulations of the thermal performance of various wall types and roof forms were evaluated for the climate of the Tamworth area. The unserviced rural site had to have a self-sufficient water supply and sewage disposal systems. The low-tech approach provided solutions within current costs and budget procedures. It has got heating racks, better lighting facilities and those sorts of things. That is a government of the time doing something for the environment. The state government has taken a step in the right direction and put its money where its mouth is on the environment by cutting down on environmental gases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This government of the moment stands condemned. I agree with the amendment that has been moved by Senator Kemp. This government has admitted that it will not meet its targets. It has given no tax incentives for people to do things to actually get greenhouse gas emissions under control. All it has done is try to put up the price of leaded fuels which has actually slugged all the people who cannot afford to buy the better cars. Instead of doing something that is more of a policy initiative to really help reduce greenhouse emissions, all the government has done is to slug individuals. </PARA>

I am appalled, however, that today we are still at this stage of the debate a few days before Australia goes to Berlin to participate in a global effort to stop this problem that has significant implications for life on this planet, including humans.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are affecting the climate of the entire planet. Scientists tell us that the planet is warming. Antarctica is disappearing before our very eyes. An iceberg the size of metropolitan Sydney is currently floating north. We are seeing increases of up to 2,500 per cent in the number of plants disappearing from the planet. Whole ice shelves are disappearing. Droughts and floods are common. Years and months are now being described in superlatives&mdash;`hottest', `driest' and `wettest' are now common. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When change is that rapid we are in trouble. Things are whizzing along. It is too late to avoid major disruption to weather patterns; it is already happening. Add in a social lag of at least 10 years to do anything to the structure of energy and material use, add in a biological lag time of about 30 years, add in a population lag time with an increasing population for at least 50 years and we are committed to things getting worse for the next half century even if we act in very strong terms immediately. Delay makes the entire situation far worse and response more difficult. It makes real rehabilitation of our planetary ecology&mdash;the conditions in which we and all other life evolved&mdash;less likely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are talking about an effective greenhouse response strategy, we mean that we need to change the basic structure of energy consumption from growth to rapid reduction of absolute carbon based energy use. That means a huge shift in the way we use energy; the way we build buildings; the way we design cities; the way we move around cities and the country&mdash;the way we do the things we do. It is a massive technical and social challenge. It is possible to do most of the things now, and do them more pleasantly and equitably. It is not a case of shivering in the dark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also the challenge of technical improvements to products. We need a national energy efficiency program that is strong and well funded and supported by appropriate legislative instruments, economic incentives and disincentives. We must include the technical challenge of non-carbon based energy sources, mainly wind and solar. The Western Australian Minister for Energy, Colin Barnett, announced recently that the Esperance wind farm saved the state $700,000 and 1.8 million litres of fuel last year and reduced CO(2) emissions by 5,000 tonnes per day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are serious about greenhouse, talking about a small program of $23 million in the environment portfolio is ridiculous. Environment might coordinate, but it is Energy, Industry, Science and Technology, Transport and Regional Development which must do most of the work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the actual cost, look at the better cities program. It cost $816 million over five years. It was a good program, but it never integrated into planning. It is finishing, and there is no sign of a replacement. It has done almost nothing to actually change the structure of our cities in a way that a real greenhouse strategy or its own principles requires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This program has failed to integrate state activities or to get its principles incorporated in state or local government practice. Even federal public and defence housing programs did not take on the sorts of things the program recommended. So we have one department doing exactly the opposite of what other departments are trying to do. We need something better as part of a greenhouse strategy. A greenhouse strategy cannot afford to fail in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An effective greenhouse response strategy will look expensive in the short term, although most of the money for a greenhouse program should come from re-allocating existing funding for state housing, transport and other purposes. We can no longer have a greenhouse program fighting programs that are diametrically opposite&mdash;that is, anti-greenhouse programs. We cannot afford it. If policy integration means anything, it means all programs having anything to do with energy use must be greenhouse programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am tired of hearing about no regrets. No regrets measures are something we should not even have to ask for. They make money. They are not initiatives; they are commonsense. Also, no regrets does not mean no dollars. There is an abundance of things that can reduce energy with economic payback periods of under three years. The initial capitalisation means that substantial money may have to be committed as loans which will be repaid. But no regrets means that we look at the likely massive costs from doing nothing. The destruction of agriculture and the effects on the global economy of climatic ecological disaster are a huge cost. Reducing that cost may be cost effective even if we have to spend what looks like a lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate Queensland for its support for domestic efficiency and assistance for stand-alone power. Even better would be assistance for establishing co-generation capacity in industry. I would also like to support the measures of Illawarra electricity which take on many of the ideas I have raised. It can be done, and it is being done. In the case of Illawarra electricity, Illawarra Power has exercised the sort of sanity Senator Coulter and I have repeatedly spoken of in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal government has been almost useless so far. Its responses are pitiful at best, a sham at worst. Where is the greenhouse response strategy? Where is the ESD policy? They are on paper but they are not real. Climate change is real, and the regrets will be very real if nothing is done. If the federal government is worried about funding, I guess it should look at other countries which are doing better. They are finding out that they spent money, took initiatives and required industry to do better, and they are doing better now because they did that and they took firm action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to enter this debate and to join my colleagues on this side in supporting the thrust of the motion proposed by the Australian Democrats. But I personally find it a fraction difficult to support the actual wording of the motion that Senator Coulter has put forward. That is why I urge all parties in the Senate to support the very constructive amendment moved by my colleague the shadow minister for the environment, Senator Kemp. It is a pleasure to see Senator Kemp in that position. I know he has done a lot of work in the environmental area. He has been up to North Queensland quite a number of times and shown a very real commitment to and interest in this area, particularly in relation to the areas that I am interested in&mdash;the barrier reef and the rain forests in North Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Kemp's amendment properly sets out the way the Senate should go: we should be criticising the government's failure `to state an effective policy on reducing greenhouse gases'. It is fairly obvious from the debate so far that the government has been all over the shop when it comes to greenhouse gases. It is not often that I quote anyone from the green party, but I refer to an article Mr Bob Brown recently wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. He sets out quite clearly the absolute hypocrisy and stupidity of the Labor Party in the way it has approached the greenhouse gas debate and all matters in relation to the environment. It is fairly clear that the Democrats have brought this motion forward in a hope to claw back some of the support they have lost to the greens. The greens are, quite obviously from the ACT Assembly elections held recently and the polling that the greens are doing everywhere, taking the vote that the Democrats used to get, and the Democrats are fairly obviously aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Brown, the greens spokesman, quite clearly sets out just how poor the Labor Party has been in its management of the environment. That is saying what we have always said: the Labor Party talks big on the environment, it makes lots of promises before elections in the hope of snaring the second preferences of green votes and it has been successful in doing so to date. But after a long learning period the people who have a genuine interest in the environment now realise that the Labor Party is simply not worth giving any credence to when it comes to the environment. So I think it is important that the Senate should adopt Senator Kemp's amendment in which the chamber would criticise the Labor Party's failure to have any sort of effective policy whatsoever for reducing greenhouse gases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a cabinet meeting three weeks ago the federal government cut new spending on its greenhouse gas response package from $100 million to $24 million over four years. That was widely reported. Greenpeace has said that the government is paying only lip-service to targets and that it has developed an isolationist policy. The conservation council has criticised the federal government, the Labor Party, for its apathy towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As opposed to that, the coalition's policy that Senator Kemp and Senator Brownhill have mentioned is a sensible policy. It was put out in our discussion paper and calls for an end to broadacre land clearing with compensation to owners to be negotiated between the Commonwealth and the states for the loss of further earnings, a no regrets approach to greenhouse reduction strategies, and a nationally coordinated reafforestation program. They are sensible ways to deal with the greenhouse problem, and they are suggestions or policy directions that have received wide endorsement from the Worldwide Fund for Nature in Australia. It supported our proposal. The Australian Conservation Foundation said of our policy that the coalition has thrown down the gauntlet to the Labor government. It has also praised many other parts of our policy. But the Labor Party has said that this all costs too much and that it is not interested in that. It is not really interested in addressing the greenhouse problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Kemp's amendment says, we have to produce initiatives which will encourage developing countries to join any new convention on greenhouse gas emissions. For all we might say about Australia, we must bear in mind that Australia is responsible for between only one per cent and 1.5 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions around the world. We have to make sure that developing countries do something about their greenhouse gas emissions. That is where Senator Kemp's amendment very clearly picks up the government's failure to produce any initiatives which would address the real problem: the greenhouse gases being emitted by developing countries. I ask the Senate to support Senator Kemp's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important debate which should not be a partisan debate about condemning the failure of government. Climate change is an issue that we all face. It is difficult to think of a more important global environment issue than climate change. It is an issue which has the capacity to have major impacts on present and future generations. For that reason, I do not think Senator Kemp's amendment is particularly helpful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not agree with Senator Coulter that nothing is being done on this issue, I share his conviction as to the gravity of the challenge that we face over greenhouse gases. For far too long human beings have regarded the environment as an infinitely forgiving system. We erroneously believed that whatever toxic garbage we produced could be absorbed by seas that were too deep, skies that were too large and soils that were too resilient to be seriously affected by the toxic garbage we dumped. However, we have learned from scientific work that this is not so. The increased ultraviolet radiation reaching the earth as a result of this damage to the ozone layer threatens to boost skin cancers, to cause sea levels to rise and to disrupt the food chain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to own up to the fact that climate change is a direct result of our energy dependent and resource wasteful lifestyle. At the present time, one-quarter of the world's population consumes 75 per cent of the world's energy. On average, each rich world resident adds about 3.2 tons of CO(2) to the world's atmosphere each year. This is over four times the amount added by each person in the Third World. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, climate change is not a problem which can be solved by the Commonwealth government alone. It is a matter for each and every Australian. It is a matter for every state government, every local council, every Australian company and Australian industry as a whole. It is obviously an international responsibility as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the brief time available to me, I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the government in my own state of Queensland and the premier in particular for the recently announced initiatives to promote an ecologically sustainable energy sector in Queensland. The Queensland government understands that the energy sector is the single largest contributor and produces about half of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions. All state governments across Australia are in an excellent position to do the same. One wonders what the agenda of New South Wales is in terms of its privatisation debate announced this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland government's initiative is a major boost to the solar hot water manufacturing industry in particular in that state. The $35 million program will comprise $15.1 million in demand efficiency initiatives, $13.5 million for alternative energy initiatives and $6.4 million for new energy advisory centres and a new office of energy management. These  are extremely important initiatives. While there clearly has to be a coordinated response from all levels of government, it is good to see this initiative in Queensland. </PARA>

Then there are larger countries like China, which is extremely keen on developing a coal industry. There is the example of South Korea, which as I indicated in this place just yesterday is doing what Australia should be doing; namely, it is taxing its fossil fuel and using that to fund the front end costs of solar hot water units in South Korea.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can see that you are listening. The parliament does not approve regulations in that sense. It operates to disallow them. It seems to me that, obviously, if we put in the act something that is not the case we would be not acting consistently and that should not go forward. Also, this amendment does not give any time limit. The Acts Interpretation Act applies to disallowable instruments and there is no provision here to refer to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the issue that has excited opposition here is the intelligence services. Normally, I would expect that the parliament would act when the regulations are made. When the regulations are made, if there is an action that is going on, that action would stop. So this would be a new practice. I have referred to the approval part and the parliamentary disallowance. This amendment, if it were carried, would mean that nothing could happen before parliament had disallowed it and I think that is inappropriate. This bill improves the transparency well beyond what applies now. The effect of this amendment is to take that transparency&mdash;which is a positive virtue of the bill over existing practice and the existing act&mdash;to an extreme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not meet the first point because, as I say, normally, if something is to be proceeded with, the regulations are tabled and it can be proceeded with until such time as it is disallowed. Clause 59(1) relates to an intelligence or security agency being subject to modifications that are prescribed by the regulations. What we are debating here is the auditing of such an agency.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this is that matters coming from the ombudsman in terms of all of the act of grace matters that the minister has to decide on are very small indeed. Most of the act of grace matters are not generated through or because of the ombudsman; they come directly from agencies. This committee recommends an outcome to the minister, who then will make a decision as he or she sees fit. We believe the composition of the committee as it is now constituted gives a far better overview of all Commonwealth Public Service and will give better quality advice to the minister as a consequence of that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are several reasons for the agency being included there. The manner in which an issue for the consideration of the Minister for Finance might find its way to him or her may not be through the agency. It may; often it is. Often it is with the agency recommending a proposition which this committee then filters and provides advice to the minister on. At least in my understanding, most of the act of grace payments that originate from agencies do so with an agency recommendation, not the other way around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the agency is involved, the agency is able to provide the committee with a great deal more information that enables the committee to take a view than otherwise might be the case. If the agency head is not there, the committee may need to invite the agency head or a representative of the agency to acquire the advice as to what the procedures and circumstances were, why the judgments were made as they were and the effect on the operations of the agency, et cetera. So having that in the tent is regarded as far better than having it out of the tent, recognising as well that since act of grace payments are always claims to spend money, having revenue raisers there who sweat blood to raise revenue provides a nice balance in the committee of the contending perspectives from which balanced advice arises. So, essentially, that is the reason for the agency head being present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add by way of footnote that anyone can raise this question. I understand, in fact, an event that occurred just this week has raised, not through the agency but through another minister, and it could easily have been a member of parliament, a question on act of grace for the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley). In those circumstances, the agency is a valuable resource tool, an advising tool within the committee in weighing the judgments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is concerned with the regulatory/accounting/accountability framework for dealing with and managing the money and property of the Commonwealth. Its scope covers the underlying principles that are to govern the activities of persons in organisations that, financially, are agents of the Commonwealth&mdash;that is, Departments; those Statutory Authorities whose enabling legislation does not give them legal ownership of money or property separately from the Commonwealth; and any body, organisation or group of persons prescribed as an Agency on the basis of its dealing with and managing public money or public property on behalf of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that makes it as explicit as we can. Again we come to the question: are we going to clutter the act with needless qualifications guarding against what vaguely someone might do or should we make the act clear as to what it means? If we make the act clear as to what it means, then that clarity will overshine any manipulation anyone wants to in the future try to work. We are dealing with trying to block what devious minds might do. In carrying legislation we should simply say what we want, and what we want is to cover the agencies of the Commonwealth&mdash;and that is clear. </PARA>

Therefore, to ensure that the definitions not be used in the future to avoid the legitimate scrutiny by parliament of enterprises which may have lesser accountability under this package of bills, it is fair that the Senate makes itself feel that these legitimate concerns have been dealt with by clarifying the situation.

I have just heard the minister say that this has come at the end of a huge process. I agree with him that this has come at the end of a huge process which began with the negotiation of the so-called accountability package what seems like an awfully long time ago but is only a year ago.

There is a difference with what the Senate would like to see happen here, which is that we would like to see the bill up and running as a demonstration of the government's good faith in response to the accountability package.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also administratively tidier for this legislation to commence at the start of a financial year because of its impact on annual reports, the auditing of those reports and the need for annual appropriation acts to reflect the AMF act's terms.

This amendment places an obligation on Commonwealth authorities and their executive officers and wholly owned Commonwealth companies and their directors to act in the public interest. The amendments then make it possible for people affected by the actions of the Commonwealth instrumentalities to take out injunctions restraining them from engaging in those activities. </PARA>

Because the organisations originate from statutes passed by the parliament, many are given a very privileged position in relation to their obligations under federal, state and local government laws and by-laws.

Forty years after World War II, we had a government which decided for reasons that escape me to spend millions of dollars on the investigation and prosecution in Australia of alleged World War II criminals. This whole business really offended the commonsense of ordinary Australians, who asked properly why they were being asked to spend millions of their hard-earned dollars on prosecuting people who had allegedly committed crimes on foreign soil 40 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was told at the time that this would be a futile exercise. The idea of getting proper evidence on this matter and being able to use that evidence to successfully prosecute people who moved to Australia many years ago was really a futile exercise. It was an extravagant waste of taxpayers' money and an irresponsible exercise on the government's part. Millions and millions of dollars were spent on this exercise, and for what? All we had were three prosecutions launched&mdash;only three from this extravagant set-up in the Attorney-General's Department&mdash;against three old men living in Adelaide. They were constituents of mine, which is the reason why I rise to speak on this occasion. All three prosecutions failed, so we have nothing to show for the millions of dollars that were spent on this exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is for the 1993-94 financial year. Presumably, it is the last report that we will see of this whole sorry exercise. This report shows that the war crimes prosecutions for the financial year from July 1993 to June 1994 cost the taxpayer $1.2 million. As well as that, the taxpayer had to pay for the defence of the three old men who were prosecuted by the war crimes unit. That defence cost $1.1 million. Sure, the lawyers of Adelaide must have loved it. It was a bonanza for them. But it cost the taxpayers $2.3 million in 1993-94 alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report ironically reveals that the only prosecution remaining at 1 July 1993 was of Heinrich Wagner. His prosecution was stopped by the DPP on 9 December 1993 because it accepted evidence that he was likely to suffer a fatal heart attack if the prosecution proceeded. So we had only a six-month period and we had only one person involved. The prosecution was halted by the DPP, and taxpayers now find out that they have spent $2.3 million in the 1993-94 financial year on this exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordinary Australians are quite properly very angry about how politicians and people in Canberra spend their money or how the government spends their money. After 12 years of this government, this is a classic example of what is wrong with this country. The government on a wing and a prayer decides that it will engage in a feel-good exercise. It says, `Let's go and prosecute World War II criminals.' Between $20 million and $30 million has been spent all up on a totally failed exercise. The government was told at the time that this was a complete waste of money. None of us liked the fact that crimes were committed during World War II. My father and many other people fought to defend Australia in that war. We all share the horror of the crimes that were committed in that war. But let us respect the commonsense of Australians who all understand that trying to prosecute war criminals 50 years after that war was a completely futile exercise. This report shows how futile it was. It is a disgrace that just in the last financial year we have an expenditure by taxpayers of $2.3 million on a completely wasted exercise. </PARA>

I was lifted up 30 feet to the helicopter. When we got up 10 feet, the helicopter moved away from the submarine. I had a fantastic view of the whole Oberon class ship cruising on the surface before I then stood on the strut and worked my way 30 feet up into the Bell helicopter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way all of that was conducted was entirely satisfactory and highly professional. The two officers who were on board the helicopter looked after me in a superb way. When I got on board and we then lifted up above the 30 feet, at that point we could see only sea because the horizon in all directions was landless. When we got up 1,000 feet above the sea, we were about 30 miles off land and we headed back above Jurien Bay to Moora. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first instruction I received from the pilot of the Bell helicopter was, `We have no doors on the helicopter to make it safer if we land in the sea.' Senator Collins will be interested in this comment. He said, `If we do land in the sea, you must hold your breath as we hit. The helicopter will go under the water and then turn upside down so that the rotor is at the bottom.' I was assured that the helicopter would float. I was not to release the safety belt until we came back to the surface again and, at that point, I was to swim clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received these instructions, and would have dutifully tried to obey them had there been any mishap. As it turned out, that helicopter landed at Moora. A naval crew was there to refuel the helicopter. We then flew to the CBD of Perth, around Bond's building and then to the airport. The helicopter trip was very professionally conducted by the navy. It very safely brought me from the submarine, which was well out at sea, back to Perth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the middle of my remarks at lunchtime I mentioned these gold dolphins that the officers gave to me which I proudly received. They are worn only by officers who have completed their submariner training. I wear them very proudly as I give this speech in the Senate tonight. I salute the 350-plus submariners who serve Australia day by day. I look forward to that number growing a little to serve in the six Collins class submarines that are being built in Adelaide and which will similarly, in replacing the Oberons, be based at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the eight or nine officers, including the very competent commanding officer, Commander Michael Deeks. I mentioned 12 to 15 petty officers whom I met. In addition, there were another 40 submariner crew members and 15 in addition in training. There were 80 of us on board. All were men. I am yet to be convinced that it is possible for women to serve in that type of ship. This can be explored with regard to the Collins class. In due course, I will very happily accept the suggestion already made by the Minister for Defence (Senator Ray) to go out on a Collins class in some months and stay overnight, as I did on this marvellous trip on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Orion</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to mention briefly that I visited every part of the ship systematically and tried to speak with all 85 men on board. I mentioned two V16 engines. One of them was labelled `Shultz' and the other was labelled `Kink'. They are the two nicknames for these huge engines that charge the batteries. The diesel engines do not drive the submarine. They only charge batteries, from which power is drawn to not only run the turbine that propels the ship but also the airconditioning system, the lights, air pressure systems and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I enjoyed four meals on board. I slept in an officer cabin. It sounds grandiose, but there were 10 of us in that small room, which is about one-third the size of my regular bedroom. I slept for eight hours undisturbed all night. I felt thoroughly comfortable. I know that the captain is the only person who has a single room, but it is only about three feet by seven feet by six feet. I greatly admire the patience and teamwork of not only the officers but all the crew as they have to put up with each other. Moreover, they wash daily, but they are only allowed to shower every third day, as water is very scarce on the ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went to the conning tower on a couple of occasions and, with binoculars, viewed the ocean and a brilliant sunny sky. It was great to see the bird life, flying fish and dolphins&mdash;the dolphin being the symbol of the submarine fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was put to me that the Oberon is really a 1950s piece of machinery. But I see it as still being enormously capable. It has a modern 1980s weapons system, which has enormous capability. I believe that it could take out any ship. Australia should feel very safe that we have these old submarines. They will be replaced by the 1990s Collins class. The comparison that was made to me is that it is like an FJ Holden being replaced by a Holden Caprice with all the electronics that are involved in a modern car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the weapons system. There is a 21-foot torpedo. There are six tubes at the bow of the ship. Many of them are used for the harpoon anti-ship missile. I am very impressed with the weapons system and the electronics that can direct that system. I will not go into the detail of it, as it is inappropriate. The sonar system is the lifeblood of the ship. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry to rise and speak on the adjournment again. I seem to be making a bit of a habit of it of late. My explanation for doing so is that I am responding to a matter in relation to which I have been mentioned. Tonight I am responding to a speech by Senator O'Chee made in this place yesterday during lunchtime while I was out of Parliament House. To say the least, the speech was somewhat colourful. I will quote from parts of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee repeated yesterday in the chamber his call for me to resign as chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. I am not going to comply with that request, but I will go further. I am going to offer to the chamber and the constituents of Western Australia a pledge that I will resign from my position as a senator for Western Australia if I am the things that Senator O'Chee said of me in this place yesterday. That is a very strong statement, but, after hearing some of the quotes&mdash;I will be quoting directly from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>and, hopefully, will not misquote Senator O'Chee&mdash;the Senate will understand why I have reached this very serious decision to offer my position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote in part what Senator O'Chee had to say yesterday. It starts at page 1765 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, it is trying to whip up a little bit of anti-Asian sentiment in Western Australia for its own political purposes . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Later it goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No honourable senator could come into this chamber and say that that sort of speech was anything other than a crude attempt, the very crudest of attempts, to whip up the old fear of the yellow peril.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it not interesting that some of the people who have come to this country on boats as economic refugees now love to point the finger at another group of people who come to this country on boats, simply by virtue of their race?</PARA>
<PARA>I further quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, for some reason, the Labor Party is quite happy to allow this sort of bigoted opinion to be aired on the national airwaves. For what purpose? For what good? I do not know. I cannot see any good in any honourable senator whipping up the old yellow peril argument: when you get into trouble, say that we are going to be deluged with hundreds of thousands of Asians. It always makes good copy.</PARA>
<PARA>I further quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The suggestion that somehow the Asians are here to rape and pillage this country is to me, and to the entire Asian community in this country of Australia, offensive, disgusting and is designed to lower the standing of the Asian community.</PARA>
<PARA>I further quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the difference between coming to Australia on a boat from Ireland and coming on a boat from somewhere in South-East Asia?</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to that point in a moment. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Labor Party is to be taken seriously on the issue of race, Senator McKiernan must resign as chairman of the committee. The Labor Party put him there. If he will not resign, the Labor Party should sack him as chairman of the committee; otherwise the word can go out from here to every ethnic organisation in Australia, to every media outlet in Australia, to every newspaper, to every radio station and to every television station in this country that the Labor Party is not fair dinkum on the issue of race relations.</PARA>
<PARA>I reject most sincerely all of those assertions that I am a bigot and a racist. I reject them very seriously. I am not going to get emotional about it, but to satisfy the rejection I am putting my job on the line. Let the people who put me in this place, the people whom I represent and claim to represent, make the decision as to whether I am a racist or a bigot or any of the other things Senator O'Chee said in this place yesterday. I do not know how that is going to be done, but if it can be proved to me that my constituents in the state of Western Australia believe me to be wrong in the public enunciations I have frequently made on the issues, clearly I do not deserve to be here. So I lay it right out in the open. My job is on the line if I am, like Senator O'Chee said very clearly yesterday, a bigot and a racist. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It saddens me greatly that the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration should say in a media release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia could become flooded with hundreds of thousands of boat people from China and . . . other Asian countries.</PARA>
<PARA>What I actually said in my public statement, which was issued on 2 March and which has been read into the record in this place, was this, and I quote in full:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I appreciate that interdiction would be a most serious step to take and should only be considered as a last resort, but the government would have to consider it if the bill is lost. I would anticipate that hundreds of thousands of people from China and other Asian countries will shortly be making plans to get to Australia. They will hear, if they have not already heard, that the numbers are in the Senate to defeat the bill.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Abetz went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did Senator McKiernan find it necessary to talk about hundreds of thousands of boat people from China and other Asian countries?</PARA>
<PARA>That is a legitimate question to ask. The answer to the question is: for the very same reason that Marion Le, President of the Indo-China Refugee Association of the ACT, made the statement in July of last year, reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper in an article by Norman Aisbett, "Boat people `threat' looms". I quote part of the article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up to 20,000 ethnic Vietnamese in the southern city of Bei Hei will present Australia with a big boat people problem, according to the Indo-China Refugee Association President Marion Le.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the answer to the question that Senator Abetz asked in his speech yesterday: why did I make the statement that I made? The reason I made it is that there are people in Asia who are hearing those statements, hearing about those actions in Australia. Whenever we go soft on the issue of boat people, those messages are heard in other parts of the world. Indeed, only last week we had an instance of some people from Afghanistan attempting to get into Australia by boat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have stood in this place tonight and made a very serious offer to the Senate and, more particularly and more pointedly, to my constituents&mdash;the people whom I purport to represent in Western Australia. If in my public statements, in my statements in this chamber, in the enunciations I have made in that press release, in the speeches I have made in this place and at public forums, in the comments that I put in letters in response to constituents, and in the mass letters that I send around to constituents, I am wrong and out of touch with my electorate I do not deserve to be here. I should not be here. If my constituents or the people of Western Australia can prove to me, can put to me in categorical terms, that I am a bigot, that I am racist, then, Mr President, I shall do the honourable thing and approach you with my resignation. I mean that sincerely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am bitterly and deeply hurt by the character assassination that went on in this place yesterday. I resent in the most vigorous way possible being called a racist. I experienced racism myself when I worked for a time in England. I know what it is like. I have experienced it and seen it at first-hand operating in Australia with the Aboriginal people and to a lesser extent with some of the minority ethnic groups. I am not going to be part of that. I resent the assertions that were made about me yesterday. I think what I have done tonight in offering my position to the people of Western Australia is the only honourable thing to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer again to a matter that I have raised in the Senate on three previous occasions, that is, the plight of former employees of the Brisbane retailer McDonnell &amp; East, which closed its doors for the last time in 1994. Senators may recall that some 30 unfortunate individuals not only lost their jobs when McDonnell &amp; East folded but also looked like losing most of their superannuation. An actuarial valuation of their funds showed that as at August 1993 the net assets held by the fund amounted to only 35 per cent of members' vested benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I raised this matter in the Senate previously I highlighted a number of irregularities with the investments and operation of that superannuation fund and the apparent lack of vigilance on the part of the various parties who were supposed to protect members' interests. A legal opinion obtained by the fund members' representatives indicated that the members had a strong case against the permanent trustee company for the losses suffered. Obviously the trustees thought so too because they then began actively to seek a settlement and made an offer to make up some of the shortfall in the fund. Most of these members have been waiting for more than 18 months and some for more than two years for their superannuation payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on or about 10 March 1995 these 30 individuals received payments which on average represented 70 per cent of their vested benefits as calculated at the August 1993 date. It should be noted that in present day terms the amount is something less than 70 per cent, given that no interest has been paid for the period of 18 months or more that has elapsed since the August 1993 calculation date or the date that they ceased employment. While 70 per cent is better than 35 per cent, they should have received nothing less than 100 per cent of their superannuation entitlement. Of course they could have knocked back the offer and taken the matter to court. Even if they did have the resources to take such action, it probably would have dragged on for a number of years, causing further stress and hardship to these people. I believe they made the only choice available to them, that is, to accept the meagre offerings of the trustee and fund manager. At least they can now get on with their lives, putting behind them the pain and distress of the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This episode has been particularly distressing for the retirees, whose entire retirement plans have been thrown into disarray. After providing a lifetime of service to his employer, one individual who was in his late sixties has now received less than the 70 per cent of his superannuation entitlement and nothing for the trauma suffered at the hands of these seemingly non-caring organisations&mdash;somewhat reminiscent of Ebenezer Scrooge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have repeatedly emphasised in the Senate the absolute necessity for our superannuation system to be one that is fair to all Australians and not just to those who are already well off. The Democrats believe that there must be protections which are as foolproof as possible to ensure that all people are guaranteed a fair and reasonable income in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the former employees of McDonnell &amp; East have now been paid, I believe that Permanent Trustee still has a case to answer. Its treatment of these fund members could only be described as appalling. Not only did it try to deny that it was the trustee of the fund when the shortfall was initially reported in the media, but also it made no attempt to explain to members why their superannuation assets had dwindled to just a fraction of their vested benefits and steadfastly denied any responsibility for the shortfall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, I understand that one of the members should have received an early retirement benefit but was paid a resignation benefit because the trustee and fund manager disputed the date at which the benefit should have been calculated. They stuck with the August 1993 date rather than the date on which the employer's participation in the plan was terminated&mdash;some five months later. This means that member has lost a significant proportion of their superannuation entitlement. The trustee and fund manager suggested a solution to this problem&mdash;get all the other fund members to give up part of their entitlement to make up the amount for their fellow member. Such a bloody-minded attitude is unbecoming for a trustee who is supposedly looking after the interest of superannuation fund members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also understand that the agreement signed by the beneficiaries and the trustee and fund manager contained a statement to the effect that, if there were any moneys that later became available to the superannuation fund, then the trustee would have first claim over the funds. What about the other 30 per cent still owing to the fund members? Does the trustee feel that it has been so generous that it now has the right to any amounts that are subsequently recovered from other sources? This seems to me to be absolutely outrageous. It was the trustee's job in the first place to ensure that the superannuation funds were secure. As it failed in its fiduciary duty to members it has no right to lay claim against moneys that rightfully belong to those members, and to only those members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the events in this case and the behaviour and attitude adopted by Permanent Trustee, I have serious misgivings about whether that organisation should continue to be entrusted with the savings of many thousands of other superannuation members. I therefore urge the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to review Permanent Trustee's licence. With an issue that is as crucial as the security of a person's financial future, the Democrats believe there must be a clear message that superannuation funds must operate in a manner which is totally beyond reproach. </PARA>

While I have been sitting here this afternoon I have re-read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 8 December 1994 which vividly brings back the memories of that debate and the issues which were raised. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no comment on what you have done. That is a proper way for you to deal with the matter.

I am a little disappointed that Senator Sherry has left the chamber because he was the parliamentary secretary on duty during the time of the debate.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to bring to your attention the circumstances concerning the debate relating to the above Bill. It has been suggested that Parliament was "misled in its debate on the existing law." Whether or not this is so is primarily a matter for the Senate to determine. However, I consider the matter serious enough to bring to your attention the surrounding facts so that you may review the matter and decide what, if any, action should be taken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Background</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some time the Law Council of Australia urged the Government to amend Section 102AG of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The topic was the subject of discussions between representatives of the Law Council of Australia and the Child Support Agency at their regular meetings of the Child Support Liaison Group. Subsequently, in July 1993 the Law Council wrote to the Treasurer setting out its views and urging the Government to amend the Legislation. A copy of our letter is enclosed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 7 March 1994 the Assistant Treasurer issued a statement advising that amendments would be made to the Income Tax Assessment Act "which will ensure that the provisions relating to the unearned income of children under 18 operate as originally intended." The Law Council assumed from this statement that the Treasurer had accepted our submission and that amendments would be made in keeping with our submission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the same month Senator Harradine moved amendments to Taxation Law Amendment Bill (No.4) 1993 to ensure that the amendments which had been foreshadowed by the Treasurer would have retrospective effect (that is, ensuring the validity of those transactions which had occurred between 1979 and 1994). For a variety of reasons Senator Harradine withdrew his proposed amendments but only after an indication had been given by Senator Sherry that "the Government will consider retrospectivity . . . "</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1994 Taxation Law Amendment Bill (No.4) 1994 was introduced into the Parliament. Because the wording of the proposed amendments relating to Section 102AG was considerably different to what had been anticipated, the Law Council resolved to make a submission proposing various amendments to the Bill as tabled. Enclosed is a copy of the Law Council's letter of 5 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the next couple of days Chris Crowley (who was handling the matter) had a number of discussions lobbying in support of our submission. So too did the Assistant Treasurer's advisers. They prepared a response to the Law Council's letter of 5 December. Enclosed with this letter is a copy of a letter from the Office of the Assistant Treasurer (addressed to Senator Vanstone) and a copy of the Tax Office's comments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter was debated in the Senate on Thursday, 8 December 1994. There are a number of references in the daily Hansard (pages 4212, 4215, 4229 and 4267). You will note when you read the Hansard that more than one Senator queried the basis upon which the Government's amendments were being made. The response from the Government's representative in the Senate (Senator Sherry) was that, relying upon advice from ATO advisers, "the amendments restate the existing law" (page 4234), see also at page 4269, where the Senator said that, in effect, the amendments simply reflected a requirement which was "part of the Parliament's original intention".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At page 4226 Senator Margetts, while referring to this specific topic said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We understand from the Tax Office that the opportunity available under law, for a child of at least 18, . . . to challenge any trust is sufficient so that the Tax Office will [sic] commit trusts even where they do not transfer assets to the children until they reach a greater age. Perhaps the representative of the Minister can assure the Senate that this is correct. We hope that it is, because it was on this basis that we support the current arrangement. If we find that it is not, we will support amendments for change."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Harradine (at page 4231) said that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Notwithstanding the professed views of a Taxation Office, it also alters the previous exemption policy by requiring that capital in both child maintenance and other trusts benefiting child pass to beneficiaries upon reaching the age of 18."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Reid (at 4233) referred to the Explanatory Memorandum which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Bill will reinstate Parliament's original intention, ..<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I have seen nothing that indicates that that was the intention in, I think, 1979."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are other portions of the debate which are relevant to this issue but no doubt you will read the whole of the debate when considering what, if any, action to take. Suffice is to say, that a number of Senators were concerned at whether the proposed amendments only clarified an ambiguity as claimed by the ATO or whether (as the Law Council has always contented) they went far beyond the intention of the Parliament in 1979.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsequent to the debate Dr Michael Dwyer published an article in the Butterworths Weekly Tax Bulletin. He analysed the issue and the competing views. He concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"one can only deplore that Parliament was apparently misled in its debate on the existing law."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In support of his submission he referred to Section 102AG(8) which provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"For the purposes of this Section, where&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) any property is transferred to the Trustee of a trust estate; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the Trustee has a discretion to pay or apply the income derived from that property to or for the benefit of specified beneficiaries or beneficiaries included in a special class of beneficiaries,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that property shall be taken to have been transferred to the Trustee for the benefit of each of those specified beneficiaries or for each of the beneficiaries in that specified class of beneficiaries, as the case may be."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Dwyer argues persuasively that the sub-section clearly supports the argument (that the trust property did not have to be beneficially transferred to the beneficiary before a trust could be held to comply with Section 102AG.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enclosed is a copy of Dr. Dwyer's article and response by Chris Hood, Senior Tax Counsel at the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will note that, in the Law Council's submission of 5 December no reference is made to sub-paragraph 8. I am not sure why this oversight occurred. I can only surmise that in the haste of attempting to prepare a submission it was overlooked. No doubt you will agree that its difficult to grasp the overall effect of a section where only parts of the section are sought to be amended. This is particularly so where the whole of the section is not dealt with in the Amendment Bill and where its necessary to cut and paste.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any event, sub-section 8 does exist and in our submission it supports the Law Council's view that the amendments in Taxation Amendment Bill (No.4) were not merely confirmatory of the intention of the Parliament in 1979 but indeed create more restrictive rules about what sort of trust is needed to comply with the scheme of S102AG. If you agree, the ATO advice was grievously wrong and the Senate may well have been misled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is any further information you require for the purposes of considering what, if any, action to take I would be happy to assist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a matter of courtesy I have sent a copy of this letter to the Treasurer the Shadow Treasurer, to each of the Senators to whom I wrote in December and to Senator Sherry who represented the Government in the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please let me know the results of your deliberations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer to two matters tonight. I refer first to the response by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, to my question asking why he misled the Senate today, and particularly his further response at the end of question time when he further misled the Senate. He was asked about the rate at which the repayment was being serviced. He had said that $10,000 a month was being paid to the bank to service the debt when in fact it was $10,000 a week. He ultimately corrected that but in correcting it he said that $10,000 a week was being paid off the debt. That is simply false. It is only the interest bill. Nothing is being paid off the debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rate of interest on the $6 million mortgage at $10,000 a week works out at $520,000 a year or about nine per cent. That is a very favourable rate; I imagine it is the sort of rate one might get if one is a favoured customer. He was simply wrong in his responses to the claim that he had misled the chamber when he said that the debt was only $6 million, not the $10 million which had been claimed in a question by Senator Alston the previous day. I quote what the minister said from the typescript of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I said yesterday was that the mortgage debt was $6 million. I was not talking about any overdraft facility that might be in existence. I was asked a question about the building debt and I responded in terms of the building debt.</PARA>
<PARA>That is simply false. Senator Evans has once again misled this chamber. The question asked by Senator Alston stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it a fact that the New South Wales branch of the ALP, already more than $10 million in debt, has been served or threatened with a notice of foreclosure by the Commonwealth Bank unless it makes suitable arrangements to service the debt?</PARA>
<PARA>Every element of the question related to the debt, not to the specific smaller debt that Senator Evans tried to convince this house was all that existed. It was a disgraceful attempt by Senator Evans to diminish the extent of the Labor Party's debt to the Commonwealth Bank. It seems to me a matter of major concern that when Senator Evans is caught out misleading the Senate he then seeks further to mislead the Senate. I stress that the debt is not being repaid under these arrangements. The $10,000 a week simply represents an interest payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I raise is that of the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank has come out today with a very carefully worded statement that deals with a selected few of the matters I have raised relating to the extraordinarily helpful role the bank appears to be playing in providing financial accommodation to the ALP. The great bulk of the matters I have raised are simply not dealt with in the Commonwealth Bank's statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Commonwealth Bank is prepared to be selective in making its statements, I invite it to be less selective and respond to all the matters that are of genuine concern about the manner in which the Commonwealth Bank has been financing the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party which, as I have already pointed out, not only has assets that are far exceeded by its liabilities but also clearly is having difficulty reducing its indebtedness, as one sees the deals that have attempted to be done to relieve the ALP of its massive indebtedness keep falling apart. The latest fell apart, we saw, at the end of last week. The bank has said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The NSW Branch of the ALP has longstanding and current borrowing arrangements with the Commonwealth Bank. The Branch is meeting obligations to the Bank under arrangements that were negotiated in a commercial manner and include a commercial rate of interest.</PARA>
<PARA>What interests me is whether or not it is commercially normal to have one's account with the bank transferred to the group credit control section, which is a section that deals with potential bad debts. Maybe the Commonwealth Bank thinks this is a normal arrangement, but it seems to me to be an interesting situation. I would invite the bank to correct me on this, but I do not know that it would be a normal situation for a client whose account is under the group credit control section to be provided with substantially increased overdraft accommodation for a specific reason; for example, in this case the fighting of an election campaign in which the Labor Party has so much money available that it is massively outspending the Liberal Party. The statement of the Commonwealth Bank then reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bank has received no approaches from either the Commonwealth Government or the national body of the ALP in relation to the funding of the New South Wales election campaign."</PARA>
<PARA>I did not make an allegation relating to the government itself. I said `members of the government'&mdash;in other words, members of parliament. It could even be former secretaries of the New South Wales branch who happen to be members of this parliament, for example. So the response to me is, in fact, a response to an Aunt Sally and not to the question I asked. The bank further states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume's allegation that the Bank has extended preferential treatment for political reasons is absolutely untrue and a matter of great concern to the Bank, which relies on commercial dealings in good faith with all its customers.</PARA>
<PARA>I am overjoyed to hear that the bank's board clearly takes the view that it was not political reasons that led to the preferential treatment the bank gave the ALP, but I would be interested to know what other reasons there were for giving treatment which is clearly preferential to that doled out to other clients. Maybe there are other clients whose accounts have been transferred to the bank's group credit control section who have been able to get this kind of special treatment. If so, I suppose the bank can say that there is nothing special about this arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple facts are that the ALP has received a particularly good deal and there is no apparent, evident capacity on the part of the ALP to repay the enormous debt, which massively exceeds the value of the security relating to this debt, and there is no doubt that the Commonwealth Bank faces a serious problem while these arrangements that the ALP is desperately trying to enter into to rescue itself keep falling apart. It is extraordinary in that situation that it should provide massive further overdraft accommodation to a client that clearly is in technical bankruptcy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
