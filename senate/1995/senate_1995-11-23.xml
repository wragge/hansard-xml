<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans. Did the Prime Minister tell you and other senior ministers that Jim McGinty, the Western Australian Labor leader, had told him six months ago that Carmen Lawrence's version of events in the Easton affair was wrong and that former Western Australian ministers would be compelled to tell the truth about the matter if subpoenaed by the Marks royal commission, or was he so willing to hide from the truth that he wasn't even prepared to confide in his own cabinet colleagues? Isn't this just another demonstration of the fact that Carmen Lawrence has been damned and found guilty of lying on the evidence of her own colleagues, or do you believe it is Jim McGinty who is the liar?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not had an opportunity to check this morning with the Prime Minister as to whether any such conversation took place. But even if it did in the terms which are reported, that takes away nothing from the position that the Prime Minister and others of us in the government have adopted from the outset so far as this matter is concerned. I note that Mr McGinty is reported as having said that he told Mr Keating he was not doubting Carmen Lawrence's honesty; what he was doubting was her recollection. And that, of course, is what has been in issue from the outset.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have had in this whole proceeding is an extraordinary exercise flawed in its conception and poisoned at source, given the nature of the enterprise on which the Western Australian government was embarked: an utterly unprecedented use and misuse of executive investigative power&mdash;not the power of the courts but the power of the executive arm of government, a process that was utterly flawed in its conduct, poisoned in its conduct, by the bizarre and often farcical way in which the proceedings unfolded under the chairmanship of the royal commissioner, and a proceeding which was manifestly flawed in the terms in which the findings were detailed and described.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, under those circumstances, taking that view, as so many people have done who have looked objectively at this whole course of events, find absolutely no reason in any way, shape or form to resile from the position we have taken, which is to believe throughout in Carmen Lawrence's veracity, to believe that this was an issue about competing recollections and to acknowledge that recollections can differ. It is not a matter of weighing bags of wheat or chaff on one side of the scale versus another side and saying, `Because there are more recollections this way than there are the other way, therefore, there must be some compelling reason for accepting the majority view.' It is a matter of taking into account all the circumstances of the matter and making an objective judgment accordingly.</PARA>

Secondly, do I take it that your indication that you have not yet had time to check with the Prime Minister as to whether Mr McGinty did tell him those things is confirmation of the fact that the Prime Minister hasn't told you about that conversation yet, nor has he told any of his colleagues; he, in fact, kept that conversation to himself?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RC6">Senator WHEELWRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Finance. Is the minister aware of media reports of calls for the acceleration in the pace of the government's fiscal consolidation and micro-economic reform policies? In light of those reports, what are the implications for those policies of the blocking of the government's announced plans for the federal airports?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3828" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just this week, in order to secure the re-election of John Howard in the seat of Bennelong and to wreck the government's fiscal consolidation program, the opposition combined with the Democrats to punch a $2 billion hole in this year's budget. Last night I might add, they punched an extra $60 million hole in the budget by rejecting the government's bill on spending cuts on HECS. What we have here is an opposition which is quite prepared to wreck the 1995-96 budget for base electoral reasons, because they despise a government that is able to balance its budget and because they want to protect John Howard's re-election in his seat of Bennelong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mid-term review, which shows the budget's progress for its first six months, will be published by the government before Christmas. I do not know what the outcome of that mid-term review will be but, if it shows that the budget now is in deficit, the people of Australia can thank the opposition senators in this place&mdash;those senators who aspire to be the next government of Australia&mdash;for wrecking a national savings strategy that would have a beneficial impact upon the national economy, reduce the current account deficit and improve living standards and jobs for all Australians. Off the back of wrecking our budget, the opposition claims that the fiscal consolidation program and the micro-economic reform program of this government is too slow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the Airports Bill was designed to provide funding for the development of the airport at Badgerys Creek in time for the Olympic Games. That will now not be possible, and the people of New South Wales and Australia can thank the opposition for that. The opposition's actions also mean that airport noise over Sydney will continue for a lot longer, and the people of Sydney can thank the opposition for that as well. The opposition, while maintaining that it will have a fiscally correct approach to managing the national economy, has run around Australia making gifts to various interest groups which, when you total them up, come to $9 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, while punching a hole in our budget of $2 billion, saying that they will get the budget back into surplus, they also have to fund $9 billion of extra give-aways on a vote buying expedition to try to buy their way into government in order to keep the promises that the opposition&mdash;by both Mr Howard and Mr Costello&mdash;have made. That means that they have to find, at least on those figures, some $11 billion of cuts in education, health, social welfare, defence, and in a range of other government outlays in order to deliver their promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will they say where those cuts are? Will they tell Australians what services they will be deprived of? No, they will not. They will keep their policy a secret and ambush the electors on the eve of the election with a mass of detail that the electors cannot digest. With the Democrats, over the last four years, the opposition have rejected all-up $11.4 billion worth of budgetary measures, either in revenue or outlays, and in the last four years they have rejected $3 1/2 billion of cuts. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is also to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to the fact that, as a result of the proposed extra $1 billion of additional spending, the shortfall in the sale proceeds from Qantas, the decision to rescind the privatisation of AIDC, the failure to sell ANL and the likely delay in the sale of the remainder of the Commonwealth Bank, the government's budget outcome for this financial year will not be a surplus but rather a deficit of up to $3 billion or more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the Treasurer's recent public statement that any additional expenditure arising from the government's so-called innovation statement will be `offset'&mdash;to use his word&mdash;what existing programs will be cut?

If not, then where will the government find the cuts that the Treasurer has foreshadowed?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have here is an outrageous foray from the opposition. This is just unbelievable: here is a party that has just punched a $2 billion hole in the federal budget&mdash;a $60 million hole last night&mdash;and they have the gall to ask questions about how we are managing the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This current budget, the budget we brought down in May this year, put the budget into surplus&mdash;and not just a surplus this year but also a surplus next year&mdash;without there being a contribution to that surplus by asset sales. What the opposition went off and did was try to wreck that and put the budget into deficit, knowing that that means that the economy is adversely affected in a myriad of ways which will hurt ordinary Australians. That is what the opposition did in order to try to undo the good economic management of this government. If credentials on economic management are at issue at this coming election, then our sober, sensible management of this economy, contrasted to that of the wrecking gang opposite, will be something that we will bring out very strongly during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing is that you have $11 billion of electoral give-aways on a vote buying spree around Australia, which means, as I said before, cuts to health, education, defence, social welfare and a number of other areas in the economy&mdash;and you are not prepared to say where and to what magnitude they will be&mdash;while at the same time maintaining that you can give $11 billion worth of promises but bring the budget back into surplus, when you have also thrown out a $2 billion revenue matter which would have contributed not only to the national savings but also to speeding up micro-economic reform in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a question in which those who are guilty are trying to turn the blame on those who are innocent. The opposition, who are guilty of this wrecking expedition, are trying to blame the government and make the government the issue. The issue here is that the sound, sober economic management of this country by this government bringing the budget back into surplus is being obstructed by this opposition with the Australian Democrats&mdash;and that point is going to be made very strongly by us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer, in referring to the forthcoming innovation statement, has said that we will cover the statement in terms of expenditure items. There will be no extra call on revenue. That is true, and we will do it without endangering any expenditure on health, without endangering any expenditure on education, without endangering any expenditure on welfare, without endangering any expenditure on defence and without endangering any expenditure on a myriad of other outlays that go to the living standards of ordinary Australians. We will do it because we are superior economic managers and we will reveal the detail of how we do it when we bring down the innovation statement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I am amazed&mdash;everyone must be amazed surely&mdash;that such a senior minister could get it so wrong as not to know which budget year he is talking about because the airport sale has nothing at all to do with the 1995-96 budget. You know that. It is in your next year's budget. In light of the minister's failure to outline where the expenditure cuts will occur, I ask: which existing taxes will be increased and which new taxes will be introduced to compensate the offset stated by the Treasurer? If it is not going to be expenditure, then will it be revenue and will it be Labor's old favourites of a wealth tax, capital gains tax on the family home or a whole raft of other new taxes that will harm Australians in the same way you have been doing for the last dozen years?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Collins for this question. It goes to a policy which I have often described as our greatest mistake as a nation. The question you raise is one that needs to be addressed because it is important for us to clear up the question of history so that we do not repeat it and so that we can build for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about the white Australia policy, we talk about a policy which took us 73 years to abolish&mdash;a policy which was in place at Federation. In terms of outlining the events until the abolition, let me make it clear that the policy was abolished by the Whitlam government in 1973. In March 1968, for instance, while in opposition, Gough Whitlam stated that under a Labor government `if a man or a woman has the skills which are welcome in Australia, the last thing we should have in mind is what race he or she is'. In June 1971, at the national ALP conference in Hobart, he promised a migration program based on a points system where matters such as race would be irrelevant. In 1972, as soon as he took over government, his minister, Al Grassby, moved to effect those changes, telling a reporter from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS> that he had given instructions that race was to be disregarded when applications from prospective migrants were considered. His words were&mdash;and I am pleased he used these:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In future, people will be treated for what they are, not on their complexion or the shape of their nose. People from Asia, New Guinea, from anywhere, will be admitted as Australian immigrants as long as they fit into the Australian scene. Colour will not count.</PARA>
<PARA>He acted in January 1973 to change migration policy and in fact changed the Citizenship Act to take out elements of explicit discrimination. That is how it happened. There were some minor changes in the 15 years beforehand and they need to be placed on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1956, under the Liberal-Country Party coalition, some minor concessions were made. They were made, as Herbert London writes in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Non-White Immigration&mdash;The White Australia Policy</EMPHASIS>, because the government did not know what to do with non-European war refugees, particularly those from communist China, and war brides. In 1966, 10 years later, under the Holt government, some more minor and restrictive changes were introduced. They followed criticism by Gough Whitlam of racial discrimination in immigration policy, particularly affecting the deportation of a five-year-old Indian girl by the name of Prasad and the refusal to allow a Filipino accountant with two university degrees to migrate to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1966, there was some codification of expressions&mdash;two new restrictive minor categories&mdash;and they reduced from 15 years to five years the residence requirement for naturalisation of non-European residents, still much longer than Europeans. There was not a change of policy at that stage, nor was there an intention to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Holt made it clear when he said on television that the review `did not mean fundamentals of the restricted policy would be changed'. The evidence is quite damming. In 1967, and after these changes, out of a migration program involving 140,000 people, 197 were non-European. You claim that was a change. There was no assisted passage for non-Europeans and the immigration department was carved up on racial grounds. There was a UK section, a European section, a mixed raced section and a non-European section.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in 1971, out of 155,000 migrants only 1,800 were allowed to sneak in from non-European bases. We saw during the 1972 campaign, when Whitlam was to take over government, people like Robert Askin claiming that Labor would `flood the country with black people'. Sir William McMahon, the then Prime Minister, warned that Labor's immigration policy would create a multi-racial society in Australia and ruin its European character.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The Industry Commission's estimates are the Industry Commission's estimates. If one looks at the reasoning by which the Industry Commission brought about those estimates, they can see the basis for them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is clear about competition policy is that it does require the full weight of competition policy to be properly implemented. That can be done by the federal government, but it most importantly needs to be done at the state government level&mdash;and it needs to be done, I might add, against a background of political certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is appropriate to observe at this point is the remarks of my colleague Senator Bob Collins about the uncertainty of the opposition when it comes to competition policy and the division within the ranks of the opposition, between the National Party and the Liberal Party, in terms of their commitment to competition policy. Because of that division and confusion, because of the conflict on the other side, there is no certainty that those gains estimated by the Industry Commission of $1,500 per household could be achieved if the coalition were in government, because there is no certainty that the coalition would provide the strength and the determination to follow through on the implementation of competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be in that context that Mr Gear was remarking. It may be in some other context that I do not have information about at the moment. But the Industry Commission's estimates were, as I recall, the potential gains for Australia, and the potential related to the full implementation of their policy and not a partial or half-hearted one.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), to a question without notice asked by Senator Jacinta Collins this day, relating to the history of the restricted immigration White Australia policy.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, my coalition colleagues and I are sure the majority of Australians of all backgrounds are absolutely sick to death of the continual revisionist attempts by this government to rewrite the migration history of this nation, and particularly the history of the abolition of the white Australia policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that it was the coalition government of Prime Minister Harold Holt that took the decisions that effectively abolished the white Australian policy of 1966, although I freely and frankly accept, and always have accepted, that it was the Whitlam government that finally swept away its last vestiges. But the essential decisions were taken by coalition governments and, more specifically, the landmark, the watershed decisions, were taken by the Holt government of 1966. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to retrace a little of the history of this whole subject, and I know that some of my colleagues will wish to do the same. It is a fact that the Chifley government's policy after the war was overwhelmingly British oriented and totally European. Its priorities were the UK, northern Europe and southern Europe. Non-Europeans were allowed to enter Australia on a temporary basis only. That white Australia policy had been the cornerstone of Labor's immigration policy since, I think, 1906. An example of the strength of feeling still emanating from that policy in those early postwar years was Labor's refusal&mdash;the Chifley government's refusal&mdash;in the late 1940s to allow Australian ex-servicemen located in Japan to bring their Japanese wives to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1949, the Chifley government was responsible for the passage of the War-time Refugees Removal Bill, the purpose of which was to expel some 9,000 Asians who were among those evacuated to Australia during the war and who, having married Australians, established businesses, or settled into employment, refused to leave after the war had ended. In 1949, one of the very first actions of the incoming Menzies government was to allow those Asians to stay in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that both Menzies and his immigration minister, Mr Holt, in 1950, like Calwell and Chifley before them, emphasised the desire for the immigration program to be predominantly oriented towards the British and Irish; it was a pretty bipartisan approach in those days. But Menzies also, even that far back, laid great stress on a broader scenario. In his address to the 1950 citizenship convention, the first one to be held after he was elected to government, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must strike down at its very inception the rather insular tendency that exists in the minds of some persons to object to a man because of his race or his religion . . . Prejudice against a migrant because of race or origin is not a sign of pride but a sign of stupidity . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(The British) of all people are the most mixed . . . the product of wave after wave of peoples from the caucasus westward.</PARA>
<PARA>Right from the outset of the Menzies government and during ensuing coalition governments, there was that importance and stress on non-discrimination on the basis of race, religion, ethnicity and all those things. That was reflected in a series of decisions in the 1950s and 1960s, leading up to the landmark decisions, which implemented major changes, that were made by the Holt government with its then immigration minister, `Oppy'&mdash;Hubert Opperman&mdash;in March 1966. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's record, in terms of non-discrimination and a progressive set of policies right through its history in government to abolish discrimination in the area of migration in this country, is unsurpassed by any political party in Australia's history. I take the greatest exception to these continuing revisionist attempts by the Labor Party opposite to rewrite the truth of this country's history. The fact is that Labor was dragged along, screaming, by coalition parties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it extraordinary that the honourable senator (Senator Jacinta Collins) on the other side should ask a dorothy dixer, inviting the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) to rewrite the history of Australia's immigration policy.

It was the Labor Party that introduced the white Australia policy; it was the Labor Party that refined the white Australia policy to its most bigoted and most extreme form; and it was the Labor Party, with Mr Calwell as immigration minister, that introduced the War-time Refugees Removal Bill that sought to expel people from this country&mdash;people who were war veterans and who had served this country&mdash;purely because of their race. </PARA>

That is what that 1949 election was all about. That was one of the key issues in that election and that was why Labor lost. But it goes on because the people on the other side would like us to believe that they were the ones who abolished the white Australia policy, that they were the ones who opened the door to the rest of the world. The door was opened to the rest of the world by the coalition under the Colombo Plan. We were the first people to actually invite people from Asian nations to come and study here.

But, Senator Collins, it was the one year in which we pulled out of Vietnam leaving hundreds of people behind who had served with our armed forces, who had served in our embassy and had been loyal friends of Australia. What happened to those hundreds of people? They were arrested; they were tortured; they were persecuted; and many of them were killed. That is the Labor Party's record on Asian immigration after 1972. They are the facts, Senator Jacinta Collins. If you do not like them, I am very sorry but that is the truth. That is how the Labor Party turned its back on its friends in 1974.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just before then, we still had Mr Calwell in 1971 asking questions about the composition of migrants following the decision by Mr Opperman to effectively abolish the white Australia policy. For example, on 19 August 1971 Mr Calwell wanted to know the number of people who had arrived in Australia in 1967-68, 1968-69 and 1969-70. He wanted the figures in tabular form based on `pure blood' and `mixed blood' people from each Asian and African country&mdash;pure blood  and mix blood people from each Asian and African country. That is the extent of the concern and regard for a multicultural country that we had under the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people on the other side inherited the most racist, political policy ever in this country. They should hang their heads in shame. The suggestion that the Labor Party had abolished the white Australia policy and was the friend of the Asian community in this country is quite clearly disgraceful, dishonest and dastardly. I believe all Australians should condemn the government for the way in which it has so wilfully misled the people and the Senate today. </PARA>

His daughter, Mary Elizabeth Calwell, has often raised that issue. I take this opportunity to put in context what she tells me about that, and which I accept.

I take this opportunity to correct that injustice to a great Australian and a great migration minister. He was not a racist in the sense in which that word is used; he was a person who had great friends amongst the Chinese community. In fact, he could speak Mandarin. He was married to a woman from Ireland. It just goes to show how tolerant he was. He was married to someone from Ireland; I sit next to someone from Ireland.

The minister was asked a question and he gave us a response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to raise a matter which is of grave concern. This issue affects people here and now. It affects our standing as a country that prides itself on its human rights record and on its attitudes to justice. I refer particularly to the repatriation&mdash;if that is the correct word&mdash;of a number of Sino-Vietnamese who have been sent back to China even though they were seeking refuge from China. Because of the operation of the safe third country legislation which passed this parliament, against my wishes, these people have been sent back to the PRC. They are Vietnamese who fled Vietnam some years ago and are now fleeing China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the hands and feet of the immigration officers are tied in this regard. What I am concerned about&mdash;and this emerged from our consideration of estimates in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee&mdash;is the fact that the federal government paid for a group of PRC officials to go and interview these people whilst they were in detention in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just imagine how you would feel if you had fled from the PRC and then were interrogated by PRC officials whilst you were in detention in Australia.

I doubt that very much. The fact is that there is no constant monitoring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The better question to have asked the minister would have been: will Australia ensure that there is constant monitoring of these people sent back to the PRC to ensure that they are not victimised and are cared for?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is a tragedy when the question of immigration and previous migration policies of this country become the topic for cheap political point scoring and gratuitous exercises such as we have just witnessed in question time today. It was undoubtedly a set-up question to allow the minister to rewrite some Australian history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people such as Arthur Calwell that Senator Cooney tried to defend were undoubtedly a product of their time. But I would challenge Senator Cooney, for example, to put into context these three comments attributed to and made by Arthur Calwell. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Japanese women should not be allowed to pollute our shores.</PARA>
<PARA>Another one:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Australians are ever foolish enough to open their gates in a significant way to people other than Europeans, they will soon find themselves fighting desperately to stop the nation being flooded by hordes of non-integratables.</PARA>
<PARA>Then another comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No red-blooded Australian wants to see a chocolate coloured Australia in the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA>I say to Senator Cooney: try to put that into context. What I have to say to this Senate is that, unfortunately, Arthur Calwell was a product of his time&mdash;and a lot of people, unfortunately, held those views within Australia&mdash;just as much as the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is a product of his time and his upbringing within the trade union movement. In his maiden speech on 17 March 1970, he said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is time we considered the enormous cost of bringing migrants to this country . . . After all, the best migrant is the infant Australian.</PARA>
<PARA>How does that make Senator McKiernan feel? How does that make me feel? How does that make every immigrant in this country feel? They are the words of our Prime Minister. He has never recanted them; he has never apologised for them, yet the Australian Labor Party has the absolute audacity to try to set up a dorothy dixer during question time to take a free shot at the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of migration, the question of our multicultural society, is a lot more serious than cheap political point scoring. That is why, with respect, on the Racial Hatred Bill&mdash;now the Racial Hatred Act&mdash;the community was so divided, because Senator Bolkus in particular and the Labor government were motivated by one thing and one thing alone: cheap politics. They were not interested in getting a consensus, of working with the people of Australia, of working with all the immigrant groups within Australia. At the end of the Racial Hatred Bill, you had these ethnic organisations supporting the legislation and another bucket full of ethnic organisations opposing the legislation. Is that the sort of country we are trying to develop? Is that the sort of social fabric that we want?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just so it is not misinterpreted as to why I quoted Arthur Calwell and the Prime Minister, let me say that there has been a deliberate campaign of misinformation by the Labor Party trying to paint the Liberal Party as somehow being racist, anti-immigration and all those sorts of things. Unfortunately, our friends in the media often write along those lines, because the spin doctors in the National Media Liaison Service and the Ministerial Media Group always pick out phrases from Liberal ministers and Liberal people from the 1950s and do not tell the media about the sorts of quotes that I have just given this parliament from Arthur Calwell and Prime Minister Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I have sought to do is even up the ledger and provide some information so that the people of Australia can see that that was an era of the past, shared in general terms by both sides of politics. We are now in a new and, might I dare say, a more enlightened era in which there is the basis for a great degree of consensus. The only people wanting to attack that newfound consensus are the likes of Senator Bolkus who think that they can make cheap politics out of this very important issue. I plead with them to desist. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The summary read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL DETERMINATION NO 12 OF 1995</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Determination made on 19 July 1995, provided for the remuneration and allowances for the Director of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 1 provided for salary of $122,400 per annum, to be reduced by the amount of any additional superannuation contributions payable by the CASA in accordance with superannuation arrangements approved by the Minister for Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 2 provided for performance based remuneration of up to $20,000 payable annually, assessed by the Board of the CASA in accordance with Guidelines advised by the Remuneration Tribunal from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 3 provided for additional remuneration of $50,000 per annum, clause 4 for travelling allowance and clause 5 for annual leave loading.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was concerned that the subdelegations in clauses 1 and 2 may have been subdelegations of legislative rather than administrative power and therefore invalid in the absence of express enabling authority in the parent Act or some other Act. On 1 September 1995 the Committee accordingly wrote to the Hon Laurie Brereton MP, Minister for Industrial Relations. On 18 October 1995 the Minister advised that the discretion given to the CASA in clause 1 could be characterised as a valid delegation of administrative power and that it was a matter of judgement whether the guidelines in clause 2 could be categorised in the same way. The Minister advised that the Department had sought legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department and that if necessary the Minister would take up with the Remuneration Tribunal appropriate amendment of the Determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has now been provided with the Attorney-General's Department advice. In respect of clause 1, the advice was that, while it was arguable that the subdelegation was invalid, the provision was not inconsistent with the power of the Tribunal to determine remuneration. Clause 2, however, purported to allow CASA to determine the level of remuneration of the Director and that clause was therefore invalid in its entirety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Remuneration Tribunal Determination No 12 of 1995 was made under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973</EMPHASIS>, which includes a number of possibly unique provisions relating to parliamentary scrutiny of delegated legislation. One such provision is s.7(7), which provides that a Determination must be tabled within 15 sitting days of being received by the Minister from the Tribunal and not, as is usual, within 15 sitting days of being made. The Minister has, however, undertaken to amend the Act as soon as practicable to impose a time limit for sending Determinations to the Minister, taking into account the debate on the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994. The Committee is grateful for this helpful undertaking. Another possibly unique provision is s.7(8), which provides that Determinations may be disallowed only within 15 sitting days of tabling, instead of the more usual 15 sitting days of a notice given within that period. On behalf of the Committee I will write to the Minister suggesting that this provision could also be amended, again subject to the Legislative Instruments Bill.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT (YOUTH TRAINING ALLOWANCE) BILL No.2 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will make changes to the Youth Training Allowance provisions of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. Late last year these provisions were incorporated into part 8 of the act and modelled on those for job search allowance found in the Social Security Act 1991. As the Youth Training Allowance and job search allowance are closely aligned it is important that any changes to one are mirrored in the other, and commence at or about the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Youth Training Allowance is just one part of the Youth Training Initiative. To those leaving school early, the Youth Training Initiative offers more than an income support payment. It offers case management, training and jobs. Young people who leave school at the end of the school year can be eligible for this assistance, not six months or a year down the track, but at around the same time as their former classmates are beginning a new year of school.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young people now realise that if they want to have a good well paid job they need to stay on at school, look for an apprenticeship or a traineeship, or pursue further vocational training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Jobs that are full-time, well paid and stable increasingly require education, training and skills. If we are to help early school leavers who are unemployed we need to give them the training and skills that will the open doors to full-time quality jobs. That is what the Youth Training Initiative aims to do and that is why we pay 15 to 17 year olds Youth Training Allowance rather than job search allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several of the amendments that are proposed in this bill will contribute directly to the main aim of the Youth Training Initiative&mdash;improving the job prospects of early school leavers. The remaining amendments will foster efficient administration of the Youth Training Allowance by keeping it aligned with the common provisions of the Social Security Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in Schedule 1 close a minor loophole in the calculation of Youth Training Allowance for those who receive a periodic compensation payment paid as a lump sum. The treatment of compensation payments to a couple where one member of the couple receives Youth Training Allowance and the other a benefit under the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 is also amended to ensure consistency across commonwealth income support measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in Schedule 2 have two objectives. The first is to allow 15 year olds who are assessed as `independent' to qualify for YTA immediately, even if they do not meet the workforce requirements. Currently these people can only be paid special benefit. The second objective is to allow 15 year olds who have a workforce history, and who live with parents who are in receipt of commonwealth income support, to qualify immediately for Youth Training Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in Schedule 3 will allow Youth Training Allowance overpayments to be offset against any student assistance payments, such as austudy, which a person may subsequently be entitled to receive. This will lead to a more consistent debt management function.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in Schedule 4 will mean that part of a waiting period served for Youth Training Allowance or sickness allowance will be transferable should a client move from one to the other during the waiting period. It is possible at the moment for a client to apply for one allowance, begin to serve a waiting period, claim the other allowance, and then be required to serve a second waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 5 enhances the provisions dealing with the waiver and recoverability of debts. The amendments will permit partial waiver of a debt in certain circumstances, as well as clarifying when it is more cost effective to waive some smaller debts. The amendments will allow for more flexible negotiated settlements to avoid unnecessary and costly administrative appeals. They also give a mechanism for considering an upfront part-payment to quit a debt based on commercial considerations. The amendments will permit the non-recovery of a debt where there are special circumstances that make recovery inequitable. Furthermore, the amendments will allow debts subject to administrative appeals tribunal proceedings to be settled in the same manner as an `out of court' settlement of a matter before a civil court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 6 makes some minor clarifications regarding the time a client has to nominate a bank account once approval of Youth Training Allowance is made, and what allowance might be backpaid if the client does not nominate an account within a prescribed time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in Schedule 7 will increase by $5 a fortnight the amount of rent that must be paid before rent assistance may be offered. It also increases by $5 a fortnight the maximum amount of rent assistance that may be paid to a family. These changes will improve the targeting and effectiveness of rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in Schedule 8 make minor technical corrections to the principal act. Among these is a clarification of the definition of `protected information.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT (YOUTH TRAINING ALLOWANCE) (No.3) BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will make changes to the Youth Training Allowance provisions of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 that are found in part 8 of the act. These were incorporated into the Student and Youth Assistance Act late last year and modelled on the job search allowance provisions contained in the Social Security Act 1991. As the Youth Training Allowance and job search allowance are closely aligned it is important that any changes to one are mirrored in the other, and commence at or about the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments follow amendments proposed to the Social Security Act 1991 by the Social Security And Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Youth Training Allowance is just one part of the Youth Training Initiative. To early school leavers this initiative offers more than just an income support payment, it offers case management, training and jobs. Case management at 13 weeks makes sure that early school leavers are not lost in the crowd. A young person's case manager works with them individually to map a pathway out of unemployment. Case managers can immediately offer a wide range of training, education and work experience options.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Early access to training, education and work experience opportunities is vital for early school leavers. Young people who enter the labour market without post-secondary qualifications or work experience find it difficult to get full-time permanent jobs. Skills, qualifications and experience are more important now than at any time in the past. The Youth Training Initiative offers a way out of the no job, no experience, no qualifications trap.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This initiative is an active response to youth unemployment. Income support should not aim to treat the symptoms of unemployment, it should work to tackle the causes. This bill will make sure that the income support component of the Youth Training Initiative, the Youth Training Allowance, operates smoothly as part of an integrated package of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in Schedule 1 mirror amendments proposed to the Social Security Act 1991. They are intended primarily to ensure the consistency of commonwealth income support measures and prevent anomalies arising between income support payments. These amendments simplify the rules applying to financial investments. At present there are many different and complex rules for calculating the income from financial investments. These amendments will mean that those rules will no longer apply and financial investments will be assessed under one set of simple rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment in Schedule 2 will provide for unemployed clients who are temporarily unable to work because of illness or injury to remain in receipt of Youth Training Allowance, instead of being required to transfer to sickness allowance. By remaining on Youth Training Allowance they will continue to access eligibility for the full range of assistance available to the unemployed. This access will encourage them to pursue education or training activities as they recover.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in Schedule 3 make changes to the earnings credit scheme. This scheme operates to provide an incentive for a person to undertake part-time or casual employment. When the ordinary income test is applied for the purposes of calculating a person's fortnightly rate of a benefit, short periods of remunerative work could have the effect of reducing the person's rate of benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, recipients of Youth Training Allowance can accrue an earnings credit from which they can offset earnings for remunerative work before the income test is applied. A person may offset an amount of earnings up to the person's earnings credit balance, which is a maximum of $500. Earnings credits are not accessible if the person's fortnightly rate of ordinary income exceeds an amount that reduces the rate of the person's assistance to nil. The proposed amendments will allow a person to access earnings credit notwithstanding that the person's ordinary income amount would, if the income test were applied, reduce the rate of the assistance to nil. Further adjustments to the application of earnings credits are also made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 amalgamate the job search allowance (JSA) and newstart allowance (NSA) into one payment type called newstart allowance. The amendments in Schedule 4 are consequential amendments arising from this change.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">DEVELOPMENT ALLOWANCE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 (the principal act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary purpose of the bill is to amend the principal act to remove certain restrictions on the restructuring of ownership of projects eligible for the Development Allowance so that a more consistent approach is available to the various types of prospective applicants for the development allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where all other criteria in the principal act are met, these amendments would allow the transfer of the Development Allowance benefit where ownership of a project is transferred to another entity after application for the Development Allowance but before registration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the amendments would allow the transfer of the Development Allowance benefit where ownership of a project is transferred from one entity structure to another type of entity structure after application for the Development Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To maximise the effectiveness of the amendments, they will be retrospective and will apply from 1 January 1993, which is the date applications for the Development Allowance closed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also provide that any applications for registration of plant expenditure that were refused, or granted in respect of an amount of expenditure that was less than the amount of expenditure whose registration was sought in the application, may be granted in full if they would have been granted in full if the amendments proposed in this bill had been in force when the principal act received Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, the amendments will provide that any application for registration of plant expenditure that was withdrawn, may be taken not to have been withdrawn if an application for transfer of the benefits of the application for registration could have been made if the amendments proposed in this bill had been in force when the principal act received Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also grant the Development Allowance Authority (the DAA) a power to determine that an application by an entity for registration of plant expenditure has lapsed in certain limited circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity is also taken to make some minor administrative adjustments and to correct certain apparent drafting errors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost to revenue of the proposed amendments is expected to be approximately $10 million per annum. Over the nine years from 1993-94 to 2001-02, the total cost to revenue of the amendments is expected to be approximately $92 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This revenue cost relates only to unregistered projects that have already restructured or have developed an intention to restructure before registration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no reliable estimate of the prospective cost of allowing all types of restructuring after registration, but the cost is unlikely to be more than $3 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is arguable whether the additional cost to revenue should be viewed as merely restoring the revenue cost of having the Development Allowance initiative operate with the economic effect that the government originally intended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important provisions of this bill are aimed against police corruption. Members will be aware that the current Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service has uncovered distressing instances of corruption and other serious misconduct. Such abuse of power and of the community's trust can never be tolerated in any police service. The government particularly regrets that serving and former members of the Australian Federal Police have admitted to the Royal Commission their involvement with members of the New South Wales Police Service in corruption and other reprehensible behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government and the administration of the Australian Federal Police is strongly committed to ensuring that it is never debilitated by a culture of corruption and misconduct. The institutional culture of a police force is of vital importance to a community. A police force stands at the threshold of the criminal justice system and is in effective control of the enforcement of the criminal law. Each police officer has an extensive authority over all other citizens, coupled with a wide discretion over its exercise. Subsequent stages in the criminal justice process, including courts and prisons, are largely dependent on the activities of police services, and will inevitably be affected by their deficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commonwealth is of course particularly dependent on the integrity and efficiency of the Australian Federal Police. First it is the prime agency for the enforcement of the Commonwealth's criminal laws. In this area it is the Australian community's first line of professional defence against crime and disorder. In addition, the Australian Federal Police provides a vital link in effective cooperation with international law enforcement bodies. It is essential that the Australian Federal Police maintain the confidence of these bodies as well as the public's confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1989 the government initiated a major and innovative reform of the legislation which governs the Australian Federal Police. The reform was designed in part to introduce a new and unique employment scheme which would inhibit the occurrence of the deep patterns of corruption uncovered in other police services. One aspect of these reforms was the replacement of tenure with a system of fixed term appointments. Another aspect was providing the commissioner with Chief Executive powers in relation to appointments within the Australian Federal Police, including the power to end the appointment of any police member or civilian staff member. One of the principles underlying this employment scheme is that the commissioner should have a clear and specific responsibility for the integrity and operational efficiency of the Australian Federal Police. Naturally, the scheme also envisages that the commissioner should have the powers and authority necessary to fulfil these responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the commissioner's power to terminate the appointment of members or staff members of the Australian Federal Police is subject only to two exceptions. The current legislation states that the commissioner must not make use of this power merely because of an act by a member or staff member where a disciplinary charge has been or could be laid in relation to that act or merely because a court has convicted or found the individual guilty of a criminal offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These exceptions were provided in order to separate the Australian Federal Police's disciplinary processes which can result in dismissal as a penalty for a disciplinary offence from the commissioner's general power to end a person's appointment. In practice, the limitations on the commissioner's dismissal power can lead to situations which are clearly inconsistent with the policy aims of the AFP employment scheme. For example, it is not clear that the commissioner can terminate the appointment of a member of the Australian Federal Police even if the member admits publicly that he or she is guilty of corruption or other serious reprehensible behaviour. To dismiss that person from the Australian Federal Police, it might be necessary for the commissioner either to invite the member to resign voluntarily or to initiate disciplinary proceedings. The commissioner's hands could be equally tied if the person were to be convicted of serious criminal offences by a court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government believes this situation to be unsatisfactory. Corruption in a police service can seriously undermine the professional self respect and morale of the decent and honest police who comprise the majority of members. It can also seriously diminish public confidence in the affected police service. Immediate and effective action may be the only way to minimise the harm. On occasions it will not be desirable to wait for lengthy disciplinary or court proceedings to be finally resolved before acting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, the bill will remove the present limitations on the commissioner's dismissal powers which relate to disciplinary offences and criminal convictions. The intention is to give the commissioner a broader and more effective power to end an appointment where the commissioner has lost confidence in a person's suitability for the vocation of policing or for continued employment in the Australian Federal Police. The amendment will, in particular, permit the commissioner to act quickly and decisively to end the appointment of a person where the commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that there has been serious corruption, gross abuse of power or serious dereliction of duty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the government believes it is necessary in the public interest for the commissioner to have a wide discretion to end appointments, it also recognises that the employment rights of individual members and staff members within the Australian Federal Police should also be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently members and staff members are protected in two ways in the event that they are retired by the commissioner before the end of their term of appointment. First, the person who is retired may seek judicial review by the Federal Court of the commissioner's decision to end their appointment. Second, the retired person is entitled to compensation for the lost part of their appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As this bill will widen the scope of the commissioner's powers to end appointments, the government believes it is also reasonable to extend to members and staff members additional remedies against the possibility that the commissioner's power might be exercised unfairly or unreasonably. Consequently, it has been decided that, in addition to the existing protective measures I have outlined, individual members and staff members who have their appointments terminated early will also have access to the remedies against the unlawful termination of employment given to employees in Division 3 of Part VIA of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. At present the Australian Federal Police is excluded from those unlawful termination provisions by the Industrial Relations Regulations. The relevant Regulations will be repealed following the commencement of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes one exception to the opening of the unfair dismissal remedies to the Australian Federal Police. It provides that where a person's appointment has been ended because of their conduct or behaviour, the commissioner may make a declaration that the conduct or behaviour amounts to serious misconduct and that the serious misconduct is having, or is likely to have, a damaging effect on professional self-respect or morale within the Australian Federal Police or on its reputation with the public or with an Australian or overseas government or law enforcement agency. Where a declaration of this kind is made, the person who has been retired will be excluded from the operation of the Industrial Relations Act provisions concerning unlawful dismissal. Such persons, however, will retain the present rights to compensation for their early retirement and to seek judicial review of the commissioner's declaration, as well as the decision to end their appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have indicated, the commissioner will be able to make a declaration only where the commissioner believes, on reasonable grounds, that there has been serious misconduct by the person who is retired. Serious misconduct is defined to include corruption, a serious abuse of power, a serious dereliction of duty and any other seriously reprehensible act or behaviour. It is also necessary that the commissioner believe that the serious misconduct is actually damaging, or is likely to damage, the Australian Federal Police in one of the ways I have described. This is in line with an agreement between the AFP and the Australian Federal Police Association which provides for the commissioner to exercise this power in cases of serious corruption and gross abuse of power. Further procedures will provide for consultation with the Association in the exercise of the power and for me to receive reports annually on the use of such powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly these are special circumstances. They are circumstances in which immediate action by the commissioner is needed to maintain the internal integrity or the public reputation of the Australian Federal Police and where it is not appropriate that an outside tribunal should be able to remake the commissioner's decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will permit the commissioner to make a declaration either before or after the behaviour or conduct in question becomes widely known.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.1 The Commonwealth Government welcomes the report by the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accountability in Commonwealth-State Funding Arrangements in Education</EMPHASIS>. The report provides a summary of many of the issues and complexities surrounding financial and educational accountability arrangements for the Commonwealth's Schools Programs and has identified a number of key issues in the post-compulsory sector for both the schools and vocational sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.2 As the report acknowledges, the question of accountability for the Commonwealth's contribution to the funding of Australia's schools is neither a new issue nor a simple one. The number of stakeholders in school education and, in particular, the roles of the Commonwealth and the States and Territories have a major impact on how accountability has developed and how it can be modified in future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.3 The Commonwealth Government welcomes the Committee's emphasis on the need to improve the reporting of student outcomes. The lack of such data has been of concern to the Government and was highlighted in the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) submission to the Committee. As detailed in the responses to each of the recommendations in the Committee's report, the Commonwealth is addressing these concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>1.4 In formulating this response the Government has had the benefit of advice from a number of key education organisations from both the government and non-government sector. The Commonwealth values the views of these organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">2. Overall Commonwealth Government Position</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current accountability requirements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.1 The Commonwealth Government shares the Committee's assumption that the annual National Report on Schooling in Australia (ANR) will continue to be the Commonwealth's chief educational accountability mechanism for its annual expenditure on schooling of more than $3 billion. This reflects the current strengths of the ANR as a reporting mechanism. The Committee has observed (page 24) that `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">good accountability mechanisms between the States and the Commonwealth should reflect the shared responsibility involved and should entail some form of shared accountability arrangements'. </EMPHASIS>The ANR is such a shared accountability mechanism. It was developed with the co-operation of the States to replace a plethora of separate, disjointed accountability requirements. It serves a number of purposes, enabling the States and the non-government sector to meet their educational accountability to the Commonwealth, it contributes to the Commonwealth Minister's reporting to Parliament and enables all levels of the government and the non-government school sectors to report to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.2 The Committee has pointed out some weakness of this approach, in particular that the framework for reporting<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> ` is not very prescriptive nor specific in its demand for details `</EMPHASIS> that it fails `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">to provide a means of making comparison between States', </EMPHASIS>that there<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> `is certainly little of a critical nature in the material provided' </EMPHASIS>and that `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">the most important consideration pertaining to the ANR as the Commonwealth's prime accountability document remains its inadequacy with respect to reporting upon educational outcomes'.</EMPHASIS>(pages 34, 36-38)<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.3 In part these aspects of the ANR reflect the fact that it is an agreed mechanism to which all States and non-government authorities must contribute. Many of the Committee's observations will be addressed in the 1995 ANR which will be drafted against a new reporting framework (see Attachment page 24). This framework, based on the new format agreed by State and Territory Ministers for Education in October 1994, includes each of the four focus areas agreed by State and Territory Ministers for Education and the Commonwealth. As Ministers have agreed that the ANR should increasingly include nationally comparable student outcomes data, the Commonwealth will be carefully assessing States' contributions (not due until mid-1996) against this new framework and will consider the need to be more prescriptive in light of that performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.4 The Commonwealth fully endorses the views of the Committee of<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> `the need for the outcomes data to be presented in such a way that will allow for comparability between States, and also over time' </EMPHASIS>with the material <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">`presented in a way that will not encourage comparisons to be made which ignore contextual backgrounds'</EMPHASIS>(page 102<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">). `The Committee believes that it is to the production of this [educational outcomes] data that most efforts should be directed'.</EMPHASIS> (pages 129-131). DEET's submission pointed out that the Commonwealth's major concern with the ANR has been the lack of outcomes data. The Commonwealth has been acting on this concern and initiatives by the Commonwealth in the last two years have included:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">development of a new framework for the 1995 and future ANRs, based on agreement by Ministers that future ANRs will increasingly report nationally comparable outcomes data;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">negotiation of agreements with States and non-government school authorities for the Commonwealth's new National Equity Program for Schools (NEPS) which include tighter accountability requirements;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">development and funding of sample studies (such as those on socioeconomic status, subject choice and non English speaking background) which include definition of outcomes or target groups as specific objectives and funding of related studies (such as the Third International Mathematics and Science Study and an Australian Curriculum Assessment and Certification Authorities (ACACA) study on Year 12 data);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">development of the National School English Literacy Survey to produce nationally consistent data on literacy performance; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">grants for Management Information Systems development, in association with the signing of the 1994 NEPS agreements, to enable systems to enhance their data collection methods so that they can report on outcomes as required under NEPS. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.5 The initiatives set out above are scheduled to conclude in the next 12&mdash;18 months. In addition, the first report of the COAG Review of Commonwealth-State Service Standards, which is aimed at predicting outcomes measures applicable to a wide range of government programs, is scheduled to be received from the Industry Commission in December 1995 (see also Response to <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3</EMPHASIS> paragraph 3.7)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.6 These initiatives reflect the complexity of educational accountability: an agreed mechanism, that covers outcomes but is not overly intrusive or onerous in its collection. These initiatives also recognise that there is no simple input-output relationship. For example the Committee has suggested that<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> `it is important that the Commonwealth obtain adequate information on the expenditure of general recurrent grants' </EMPHASIS>(page 17<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">).</EMPHASIS> As with all education funding it is sometimes difficult to determine a direct relationship between specific funding and educational outcomes. The Commonwealth is concerned to develop better reporting of educational outcomes, consistent with the COAG agreement that the Commonwealth's interests will be in broadly agreed strategic goals involving program planning and a concern for achieving program performance and outcomes for clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.7 One of the fundamental principles underlying the establishment of the ANR is that the outcomes of schooling cannot be attributed to individual inputs. Accordingly, the ANR concentrates on the overall outcomes of schooling, rather than accounting separately for Commonwealth, State and other inputs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.8 The Committee refers to substitution of Commonwealth funds for State funding, citing allegations relating to special purpose programs in Victoria. The issue of substituting Commonwealth for State funds is an ongoing issue of public concern and affects all Commonwealth-State programs, not just those in education. The Committee notes that substitution is difficult to detect and quantify, although suspicion of the practice is widespread (page 55). DEET has no direct evidence concerning substitution of funds for specific programs. There is, however, evidence from State budget documents that, while the Commonwealth is increasing its level of funding for schools, some State Governments are reducing their expenditure and that a de facto substitution of Commonwealth for State effort is taking place. For example, the Victorian Budget for 1995-96 shows a minor decrease in funding of 0.1 per cent for each government school student. Commonwealth funding to Victoria has increased, however, by 1.8 per cent in real terms and, if the Commonwealth's effort is taken out, there has been a real decrease in State expenditure of 0.5 per cent for each student.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.9 The Commonwealth agrees with the Committee's view (page 57) that making the accountability pathway more transparent will do much to allay suspicions of substitution. While emphasising the need for better reporting on outcomes, the Government considers it important that sufficient attention is paid to the source and maintenance of effort for inputs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.10 Most Commonwealth special purpose funding for schools equity programs is provided under NEPS. From 1994, NEPS agreements have included the requirement that Commonwealth funds should not replace existing expenditure of States/systems. In addition, education authorities are required to report each year on total equity resources associated with the equity target groups. Total equity resources encompass NEPS funds, other Commonwealth funding and `all other equity inputs' including State funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Future directions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.11 The Commonwealth does not accept the comment of the Committee that DEET is waiting for the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Review of the Commonwealth-State Service Standards to produce outcomes measures. The Commonwealth is already supporting a number of projects to improve reporting of education outcomes. The report of the Industry Commission's inquiry for COAG, and the views of COAG on the findings, will influence future accountability measures but it will not be the sole influence (see also Response to <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3</EMPHASIS> paragraph 3.6).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.12 The Commonwealth will continue to do work on educational accountability measures through the following mechanisms:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">refining existing processes such as the ANR and NEPS agreements to place greater emphasis on reporting of educational outcomes (these are described in detail later in the response);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">co-operating with the States and Territories and non-government authorities to create data bases on student learning eg National School English Literacy Survey;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">considering the findings of the COAG review and of independent studies into educational outcomes; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">considering the implications of the Review of Resource Levels in Government Primary Schools which has examined the level of resources available to government primary schools for literacy development.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.13 The Commonwealth remains committed to seeking useable and relevant information about schooling outcomes, at the same time balancing this accountability with flexibility in reporting requirements.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.2 The Commonwealth agrees with the Committee that accountability requirements should involve the provision of high-quality information, including information on outcomes, through efficient means involving a level of effort by education authorities commensurate with the value of the information being sought and provided. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the Hon Simon Crean MP, has recently written to all State and Territory Ministers for Education seeking their cooperation in accelerating progress on the development of outcomes indicators and requesting their full participation in the National School English Literacy Survey.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.3 State and Territory Ministers for Education and the Commonwealth have agreed that future National Reports should increasingly move towards the inclusion of nationally comparable student outcomes data.

As part of that process, the issues raised in the draft Protocol for Developing, Implementing and Reviewing Programs Funded by Commonwealth Specific Purpose Payments to the States and Territories prepared for COAG in 1994 will be addressed. The draft Protocol covers issues such as outcome reporting, the use of performance indicators, program funding arrangements, non-performance provisions and joint recognition of the contribution of governments.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.6 COAG is a joint Council of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and the agreement of all parties would be needed to implement such a recommendation. The Commonwealth sees value in developing various contributions to the difficult area of determining performance indicators for school education. The COAG exercise is looking at government schooling as one of a number of government services, with a view to enhancing both the effectiveness and efficiency of service provision in the longer term. This is part of the agreement by COAG that, in the areas of shared responsibility, the Commonwealth's interests will be most often in the area of joint, broadly agreed, strategic goals involving program planning and a concern for achievement of program performance and outcomes for clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.7 There is potential for valuable cross-fertilisation across service areas in this process and the COAG Schools Working Group is working in consultation with the MCEETYA Schools Taskforce. The terms of reference for this Taskforce include:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.9 The issues raised by the Committee have already been taken up in the National School English Literacy Survey. One of the principal aims of the National School English Literacy Survey is to establish national benchmarks in English literacy against which Governments and teachers can reliably assess the effectiveness of their literacy programs. Currently all States and Territories, non-government school authorities, unions and other interest groups are involved in the process of developing a methodology for collecting national data on the English literacy attainment of school students. All sectors with interests in this area are represented on the Steering Committee for the National School English Literacy Survey. The framework for the development of the methodology is the national English curriculum profile. If this exercise is successful, this methodology for collecting data could be applied to other learning areas and be used for the ANR. While the two largest States have not committed themselves to participate in a trial, both have said that they wish to continue to be involved in planning for a trial and the proposed Survey. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training, has written to all State and Territory Ministers for Education seeking their full participation in the Survey and their agreement to accelerate cooperative work on the development and reporting of outcomes indicators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.10 The Commonwealth is also supporting the Educational Outcomes for Disadvantaged Groups project directed by Professor Richard Teese at the Department of Social and Educational Studies, University of Melbourne. This will measure social access to post-compulsory education and training throughout Australia with a view to providing hard data on student outcomes for policy decision-making and resource targeting. The project's three components focus on the mapping of educational outcomes by geographical region, gender, social differences and subject taken, on the surveying of educational outcomes for Year 10, 11 and 12 students using academic and cultural measures and comparative international studies on educational outcomes.

If one considers the report and the government response, one can see that these are issues that the committee has examined in detail and that the government has considered them carefully and, in my view, given a very good response to the committee's considerations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central issue of this report relates to the Commonwealth-state accountability and in particular the capacity of state governments to undermine the national program educational objectives of the Commonwealth by substituting Commonwealth funds for state funds. These are very important issues in so far as they go to the question of future opportunities for many thousands of Australians, to future opportunities of this country and to the very basic question of the future opportunities in terms of equality that we are, I would hope, all committed to in ensuring that Australians all get a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is spending considerable sums of money on its commitment in education, and that commitment is not being met at the state level. This report highlights the discrepancies that exist in both the accounting practices that exist between the states and the Commonwealth, and the fact that the states are not meeting their obligations to the Australian citizens of today and, of course, of tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to the government's response, which highlights the complexities of the issue in terms of tracking substitution at the state level. In particular, I refer to the report where it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that substitution is difficult to detect and to quantify, although suspicion of the practice is widespread . . . DEET has no direct evidence concerning substitution of funds for specific programs. There is, however, evidence from State budget documents that, while the Commonwealth is increasing its level of funding for schools, some State Governments are reducing their expenditure and that a de facto substitution of Commonwealth for State effort is taking place. For example, the Victorian Budget for 1995-96 shows a minor decrease in the funding of 0.1 per cent for each government school student. The Commonwealth funding to Victoria has increased, however, by 1.8 per cent in real terms and, if the Commonwealth's effort is taken out, there has been a real decrease in State expenditure of 0.5 per cent for each student.</PARA>
<PARA>That is occurring right now. It is not an historic argument; it is a contemporary argument and goes to the very basic question of what is the real commitment of state governments in this country to the future of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many have said&mdash;and it has been put on many occasions by many state premiers&mdash;that, because the Commonwealth expends only 10 per cent or 12 per cent of total funding in education, it has no role. Those figures are now being substantially challenged. The significance of that is that, when you do look at total expenditure by the Commonwealth in education and you add up not just tied grants but untied Commonwealth contributions to everyday running costs and capital outlays of government schools, you find that the effective total Commonwealth contribution of funding per student for government schools is now just under 44 per cent. So it is quite clear that this is an issue that does not relate just to the states. This is an issue that is national and is of importance to this whole parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent reports by the government have picked up the evidence contained in this committee's report. So this committee's report is now starting to flow right through government action. For instance, the recent Schools Council's report on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Resources and Accountability: Commonwealth Funding Scenarios for Government Primary Schools</EMPHASIS> came to similar conclusions as those which were drawn by the Senate committee itself and which have been picked up by the government in its response here today. The Australian Education Union's recent publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Creating an Education Nation for the Year 2000</EMPHASIS> also highlights similar themes in its call for greater Commonwealth vigour in accountability arrangements for the spending of the Commonwealth education dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a growing demand across this country for the Commonwealth to be more involved in education. There is a growing demand for the Commonwealth to ensure that there is equality of opportunity. The whole issue relates to the conditions of funding because it is on that basis that the great doors of inequality will be unlocked. It is the device by which the Commonwealth can intervene to ensure that Australians genuinely do get a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen in recent times is a whole debate arising about whether or not measurements of contribution should be made on the basis of inputs or outputs. I notice recently that Senator Tierney called for a greater focus on the question of effective mechanisms for measuring education outputs. It is not very often that Senator Tierney and I agree on anything, but on this occasion we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, on this issue what has been said by Minister Simon Crean repeatedly is that the problem with that approach is that the states refuse to participate in effectively drawing up decent outcomes data in such a way as to see exactly what is occurring across this country, because there is a vested interest in confusion and in ignorance. There is a vested interest in making sure that people don't know what is happening to our schools in this country at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in recent years the Kennett government in Victoria cut school funding by 10 per cent&mdash;some $240 million in real terms. The effect of that is something the Liberals in Victoria do not want to be known. They do not want the public to appreciate what the effect of such devastating cuts has been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen that, while the Commonwealth is increasing its spending on schools to unprecedented levels, some $3 billion a year, the Victorian government is reducing its budget outlays year by year. In terms of budget outlays on education in Victoria, the percentage of spending has dropped from 26 per cent in 1989-90 to 18 per cent last year. It is a dramatic drop. There is an ideological divide occurring in this country about the importance of education. Of course conservative governments at the state level think too much money is being spent on education. The argument now is that the Commonwealth is doing too much in education and the conservative governments would like to cut that back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you exclude the Commonwealth outlays, there has been a six per cent drop in funding in Victoria on a school by school basis. In terms of recurrent funding in Victoria, there has been a further fall of 5.1 per cent, despite the 1.8 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding in the last year. Teacher numbers have fallen by 3,000 in 1993 and a further 2,900 in 1994, and they continue to decline. There are now some 300 fewer schools in Victoria and a further 32 were signalled for closure in this year's state budget. The pupil-teacher ratio in Victoria has increased from 13.2 in 1992 to 15.1 in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, if we look at retention rates we see that a similar pattern emerges. There was a time when there was a view that Victoria had the best educational conditions in the country. We now have a situation where, after just a few years of coalition government in that state, Victoria has amongst the worst conditions in education. To me that is despicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just on a national basis that the conditions have fallen; this has occurred on a regional basis as well. Quite deliberate discrimination has occurred in the north-west of Melbourne, in the working class districts of Melbourne. Resources have been moved from one part of the city to another part in quite a callous way. So the levels of opportunity have fallen not just in general terms but in quite specific and regional terms as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the movement towards new policies in Victoria, the opportunity for the public to examine these issues is becoming increasingly difficult. Of course that is what the Schools of the Future program in Victoria is all about, making sure that everything is done at such a local level that no-one knows what is happening at the state level and, as a consequence, no-one appreciates what is happening to the national objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I once again congratulate the government on its response and hope the minister is able to implement those responses on a speedy basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to bring to the notice of the Senate the detail of a threatening letter sent by the Labor member for Paterson, Mr Horne, to the New South Wales branch of the Cattlemens Union. The letter comes to me from the Vice President of the New South Wales Cattlemens Union, Jim Henderson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has prompted this threat from Mr Horne, the Keating candidate in Paterson? This is the same candidate who has tried to run away from his ALP affiliations, the man who tries to present himself as an independent member of parliament, like most of the Labor members right across Australia who are in marginal seats and who realise that Paul Keating is a great albatross around their neck and do not really want to be associated with him or his party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this letter Mr Horne got very steamed up because his Liberal opponent, Mr Bob Baldwin, was invited to address the Cattlemens Union at a meeting in Gloucester in the Paterson electorate. The members at Gloucester wanted to hear about the Liberal attitude to the ALP Carr government's plan to take away farmers' rights to farm their own land. The SEP-46 plan is a total overkill by the Carr government on overregulation to stop land clearing. The regulations go much further in controlling scrub clearing and infringe on farmers' rights to manage their land and their pastures as they best see fit as farmers and custodians of the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This letter to Mr Henderson from Bob Horne shows he is really squirming at the draconian actions of the Carr ALP government and he is very worried about the effects on his votes in the seat of Paterson. He is at the moment trying to stave off defeat in that seat. It is a seat sitting on 3.4 per cent. We have a very highly effective Liberal candidate, Bob Baldwin, who is really hitting the mark, as people realise, in the Gloucester area and all the farmlands around the Paterson electorate that this Labor government is neglecting the farmers. This letter sets out Mr Horne's desperate feelings and his specific threats to the Cattlemens Union. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Jim</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I read of the proposed meeting on Sunday 19th November 1995 at Gloucester regarding a number of issues affecting rural residents. I can assure you I fully support public meetings to co-ordinate action on any issues, particularly when speakers with practical experience, commonsense and expertise have been organised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that SEPP 46, a state planning issue, is to be addressed by the Liberal candidate for the Federal seat of Paterson. This is an issue that is obviously unrelated to the role of a Federal candidate. It is an area in which he has no jurisdiction, nor, I believe, any practical experience or expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Federal member representing your area, as a cattle producer for twenty-three years and as a member of the Cattlemen's Union, I assume that your committee deemed me unsuitable to be invited to participate.</PARA>

It is totally democratic for Bob Baldwin to speak to a community group with particular concerns. Mr Horne, if he had had enough interest, having received an invitation, should have turned up and possibly responded.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I raise before the Senate in this adjournment debate relates to the inadequate provision of maternal and child health services in Victoria. This matter highlights the hypocritical position taken by some senators opposite, especially those from Victoria, with respect to, amongst other things, changes proposed in the Child Care Amendment Bill. Whilst critical of the proposals to reasonably limit the amount of subsidised child care for children of non-working parents to a 12-hour period per week, no mention is made of the attacks which are being made on families by their Victorian state parliamentary colleagues. There has been not one mention of the horrendous cuts to maternal and child health services, kindergarten funding and the public hospital system&mdash;all which are having devastating consequences on Victorian families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my fellow senators are aware, I recently had cause to use the maternal and child health services. Historically, in Victoria, the maternal and child health services have played a vital role in ensuring the good health of babies and their mothers with the provision of services such as early identification of problems; prevention of child abuse and postnatal depression; support of breastfeeding and immunisation of babies; establishment of play groups and parents groups; and providing advice, information, family support and referrals to other services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, under the Kennett coalition government in Victoria, a program called Healthy Futures operates. It partly funds just one component of a true maternal and child health service; that is, developmental monitoring at 10 set stages, with limited funds, for special needs visits&mdash;10 visits over 3 1/2 years. What a wonderful example of Liberal style support for families! My own son is three months old now, and we have used almost half of his allotted quota of visits at this point in time. This is a child who is not unwell and who spends more than half of his time out of the actual state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government can choose whether it provides more than this minimum service or not. Many councils have chosen not to fund additional maternal and child health services&mdash;and this is the type of choice that the coalition talks about. As a consequence, the provision of this service is highly inconsistent right across Victoria. In all areas the changes have restricted access from flexible arrangements depending on need to a rigid quota system which is not able to adequately meet the needs of new mothers. It is inconceivable that new mothers and their babies should have to wait a week to be able to see a maternal and child health nurse for 15 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Victorian Healthy Futures program, maternal and child health nurses are restricted from seeing mothers less than five days after they have given birth. Yet under the health policies of the Kennett administration, mothers are being pushed out of public hospitals after two or three days. No-one seems to know who has the responsibility for the care and support of new mothers and their babies in the event of a problem presenting on the third or fourth day after the child's birth. No-one seems to know, and the Victorian coalition government certainly seems not to care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Problems occur out of hours and 10 visits are not adequate. People go to the chemist where unqualified people are expected to give advice. That is the plight of mothers in many areas across the state&mdash;having to take advice from unqualified people in the `privacy' of a chemist shop. But there has also been a plethora of pharmacies offering the services of a maternal and child health nurse to their customers. This is coalition policy at its worst; it has led to the corporatisation of a health service provided by the state government which was previously free. But who is there now to ask about the qualifications of these experts in pharmacies who are providing advice? And who is there to provide ongoing care and follow-up where it is necessary?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kennett style liberalism has taken the maternal out of maternal and child health services and is attempting to downgrade the service into a glorified baby weighing service. Spending on family support services, such as maternal and child health services, should be regarded as an investment in the future wellbeing of children, families and communities, repaying their costs by the prevention of serious and costly health and social problems which will be picked up in the future. Governments must recognise the essential role of families in the love, care and nurturing of babies, and governments must provide support to families in that caring role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria the state government has also reduced funding to kindergartens by 20 per cent. This has brought about an increase of between 30 and 300 per cent for costs of kindergartens to most families. Principally because of the lack of ability to pay increased fees, many families now view child care as an acceptable alternative to kindergarten. The Kennett government has unashamedly viewed kindergarten and preschool as an unnecessary adjunct to a four-year-old's life. Many parents, usually on one income, not receiving a health care card, will have to prioritise their child-care costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems raised with the Child Care Amendment Bill relate to cutbacks in state services and a need for greater flexibility in the provision of child-care services, rather than in any abrogation of responsibility on behalf of the federal government. A few private child-care centres unable to utilise spare capacity have not viewed the 12-hour proposal well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But after-school care, before-school care and occasional child care are all important times when child care is a necessary component of family wellbeing&mdash;and the industry should cater for it. Private child-care centres must be made to adjust to the varied and changing needs of their clients and have flexibility in their administrative arrangements. Parents who choose to utilise the 12-hour limit of subsidised care should be able to have their child in care over three days, if that is what they require, without overpayment and without oversubsidisation by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this chamber we have heard much about the support that families need. But there has not been one mention of these horrendous cuts which have occurred under a Victorian coalition government&mdash;Victoria, a state where a senior health bureaucrat feels safe to slam the federal health and welfare system that we are meant to believe the federal coalition will preserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr John Paterson, the Secretary of the Victorian Health and Community Services Department, in an annual report released yesterday, stated that the federal health and welfare funding conditions have created a `ramshackle socialist-type system'. He said that Medicare was `a good idea gone wrong'. Dr Paterson said that similar systems had flourished and eventually caused the downfall of the Soviet Union, but that Australia's health and welfare systems `slept on in cosy protection'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Panizza formally moved notice of motion No. 1870 concerning the sinking of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. The sinking of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> on 19 November 1941 has gone down as an unparalleled disaster in Australian naval history. There were no survivors of the 645 officers on board and therefore no-one to tell the tale of the ship's engagement with the disguised German auxiliary raider the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS> off the Western Australian coast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> sank virtually without trace. All that remained were a small carly float and two charred lifebelts, while more than 300 Germans were rescued from lifeboats. The mystery remains, though there are a number of theories that explain what happened. The question whether the carly float came from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> is still debated. The body that was washed up on Cocos Islands some months after the disaster may or may not have come from HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. It was a tragedy that cut deep into the national psyche. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> was considered invincible and her actions on that fatal day have never fully been explained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> had a battle inspired history. She had played a leading role in the Mediterranean during May 1940. During her time there, she suffered over 60 air attacks and the Italians claim to have sunk her more than eight times. In July 1940, during the battle of Crete, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> sank the Italian cruiser <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bartolomeo Colleoni</EMPHASIS>. These were grim days for the allies, with retreats in the desert and the Battle of Britain about to be joined. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>'s success was a rare flicker of hope. She had the status that we would today give to all our sporting heroes combined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> was reassigned to the defence of Australia and arrived in Sydney on 9 February 1941. Nine months later she was sunk. Former Navy Minister Billy Hughes remarked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This magnificent ship had seemed to have a charmed life. She had run the gauntlet of the toughest battles in the Mediterranean and escaped with not so much more than a scratch on her paint. Everyone of her countrymen had thrilled to her exploits.</PARA>
<PARA>As Tom Frame points out in his excellent book on this tragedy&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMAS Sydney Loss and Controversy</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the war had certainly come to Australia's doorstep. To be sunk so inexplicably by a sinister German raider was a very great concern. Flags on public buildings in Sydney were flown at half-mast as a mark of respect on the morning of 1 December 1941. The city had lost its flagship. The loss was made even worse from the point of view that six days later, on 7 December 1941, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lord Mayor of Sydney, Alderman Stanley Crick, said that the city had suffered the greatest heartache in its history. An HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> replacement fund was launched in every capital city. Tom Frame observed that apart from the little that the German survivors could recall or were willing to disclose, the reasons behind her final and inexplicable movements and the disappearance of the ship and her men were destined to remain, and have remained, a mystery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite detailed research carried out in Australia, Britain, the United States and Germany, the absence of a single survivor from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> to describe the action through Australian eyes means that the prospects of solving the mystery will always be limited. Tom Frame further observed that since its foundation in 1911, the Royal Australian Navy has quickly learned from its mistakes. That no other ship was lost in similar circumstances to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> during the war suggests that the navy learned all there was to learn from her loss. But despite all the theories of what happened, there is still a large question mark about her loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country owes the surviving family members of those who lost their lives on HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> the consideration of a full-scale public search for the vessel and the erection of a memorial in Canberra, as Senator Panizza calls for in his motion. I understand it will not be easy to locate the wreck because the area that will have to be searched is very large. I heard a naval salvage expert say recently that anything over 100 square kilometres was very difficult and very expensive with present technology, but he suggested that in time that will change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also fully support Senator Panizza's suggestion that the government approach the British government to lift its 70-year moratorium on releasing its war file on the sinking of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> so that we may know more of the facts and circumstances surrounding the sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>, because undoubtedly there are some other theories that can be put to the test.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add my support to Senator Panizza's motion. It was a very great loss to Australia in a very dark period in our history and it would be very important to know a little more about what happened.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept that, Senator Panizza; you are quite right. The document, which is an inter-office memo, is headed `Filing&mdash;Facts'. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issues surrounding this matter arise from the Annual General Meeting of the Joondalup Branch of the Party held at the Wanneroo Recreational Centre on the 12th of September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were 15 members present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were approximately six other observers including the State President, Mr Honey, the Member for Moore, Mr P Filing, and the Divisional Secretary Mrs J Debnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The election of office bearers was chaired by the State President with the Divisional Secretary being the returning officer. The scrutineers were Mr Filing and a Mr Stevenage. At 9.00pm the Divisional Secretary was required to leave for personal reasons and Mr Stevenage then took the position of returning officer. Mr Ron Privilege became the second scrutineer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The President of the branch was duly decided and then Mr Filing objected to the eligibility to vote of three members then present and seeking to vote. They were Terry Darby-Smith, Peter Cook and Grant Greenhow.</PARA>
<PARA>This must be riveting stuff for the people of Australia; however, be that as it may. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The elections of other office bearers then proceeded upon the basis that there would be a disputed result with three votes sectioned off to be determined Head Office with the count to be completed at Head Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thereafter Mr Filing attended at Head Office to scrutineer the completion of the count of the branch votes for the various positions as affected by the sectioned votes. The other scrutineer did not attend and was apparently not notified and the count proceeded with the State Director doing the count and only Mr Filing in attendance. It transpired that Mr Filing offered or agreed to take the results (which were then still the subject of a dispute although no formal complaint had then been received contesting the validity of the sectioned votes) away and distribute them to the Branch President and the Divisional Secretary. He then distributed a result in accord with his initial objection to the various members eligibility as if there had been no dispute or sectioning of votes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to this, in the election of Divisional Conference Delegates he published a result that was not in conformity with the count in any event. In this instance he published a result that not only did not include the disputed members as elected but also excluded one of the elected office bearers, one Tony Ricciardo whose eligibility was not in question. This meant that there were two additional individual members elected to be delegates to Divisional Conference. Ricciardo was already to be a delegate as he had been previously elected as a Divisional Council delegate which gave him voting rights at the Divisional Conference. Had Ricciardo been elected to two positions entitling him to vote at Divisional Conference (as in fact was the case) he would notwithstanding only have had one vote as delegates are not entitled to multiple voting rights at Divisional Conferences [see Constitution Clause 137(k)(ii)].</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should Mr Filing seek to maintain that he removed Mr Ricciardo upon the basis that he was already a Divisional Council delegate&mdash;this does not ring true as the member who moved up the ladder to fill the fifth delegates position was Mr John Rice who had also been elected as a Divisional Vice President and was already entitled to vote at Divisional Conference and on such an analysis should also have been removed. Effectively what appears to have transpired is a "pickled vote" as delivered by Mr Filing to the Branch President and the Divisional Secretary. The proposition is that Rice, already being an elected delegate to Divisional Conference would not have had a vote as number five delegate of the Branch to Divisional Conference. All of this occurred one week prior to Divisional Conference for the Moore Division.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Filing's electoral officer, Reva Evans personally delivered the "pickled" result to the Divisional Secretary on the 3rd of October at approximately 7.30pm. The Divisional Conference was scheduled and duly held on the 11th of October 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the 4th of October 1994 the other scrutineer, Mr Ron Privilege attended at Head Office and observed the State Director count the votes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Divisional Secretary had by the 4th of October 1994 confirmed with the State Director that there were two results but as there had been no official complaint the three disputed members were eligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Moore Divisional Conference Mr Filing objected to Mr Darby-Smith, Mr Greenhow and Mr Cook voting. It was explained to him that there had been no official complaint as to the Joondalup Branch elections and Mr Filing responded that there would be. The State Director had prior to the commencement of the Divisional Conference informed the Divisional Secretary that there was no problem with respect to the accreditation of the three disputed members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Divisional Secretary advised Head Office as to her understanding of who was accredited during the afternoon prior to the meeting and did not receive any advice to the contrary other than orally from the State Director as stated, to confirm that the three disputed members were eligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the 24th of October 1994 the State Director wrote to Mr Filing seeking an explanation as to these events. By letter dated the 28th of October 1994 Mr Filing confirmed as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Thank you for your letter of 24th October 1994 concerning the count of the Joondalup Branch AGM.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have enclosed, as requested, a copy of the list compiled for and on behalf of the Joondalup Branch President and at his request delivered to the Divisional Secretary.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This list is based on the count for positions, excluding the disputed members. The list was the same as the hand written one copied and retained by you.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I can be of any further assistance, please let me know."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second sentence in the penultimate paragraph is incorrect as set out above in that Ricciardo's name had been deleted from the list of Divisional Conference Delegates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Action</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is suggested that the State President put these matters to Mr Filing and request that he attend State Executive and answer the issues.</PARA>
<PARA>That means absolutely nothing to anybody who does not understand the machinations of the Liberal Party of Western Australia. It was that document that caused me to ring the leadership of the Liberal Party when I was asked to make sure that no motion against Mr Filing was moved for his suspension, censure or expulsion. I made it quite clear to the leadership that I was gravely concerned about the prospect that anything of an improper nature should proceed through the state executive with my approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As events transpired, I managed to negotiate Mr Filing through state executive without a motion of any sort. Mr Filing had the audacity yesterday to provoke me to make those comments. He referred to some matters in my document. This particular matter was not referred to. My judgment of Mr Filing was reaffirmed because he was silly enough to raise something which is potential dynamite for him. He questioned the veracity, integrity and objectivity of my document in so doing. I apologise that I did not give Senator Panizza the document earlier. I did not realise I was on until 30 seconds beforehand and I had to run all the way from my office. </PARA>
