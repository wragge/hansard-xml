Senator Ray is simply ignoring that ruling and saying that he wants to go on and put it in context which, of course, is code for saying that he wants to make a political attack on his opponents. He has no intention of answering the question.

It is entirely appropriate that the government be able to answer the question with all of its implications, both implicit and explicit. That is what Senator Ray is doing.

You should be absolutely ashamed of your state colleagues for bringing about this form of legislation, legislation that says at any stage the minister for industrial relations can remove a union's right of coverage in Western Australia, then arbitrarily reallocate their members to another union with no right of appeal whatsoever.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no right of appeal, Mr President, to the minister's decision to say that that union does not have coverage. There is right of appeal on new grounds on the allocation of workers to new unions. This particular set of legislation is draconian in the extreme. It seeks to take away the rights of citizens and workers in this country and it reflects the obsession that the coalition has on industrial relations policy. All the old demons of the past are coming back in industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it was best summed up by the remarks of Mr Kennett in September when he said that, if there is a coalition government elected federally, there would be no escape for workers in Victoria then, that he would bring down an industrial relations iron curtain around Victoria, backed up by their federal colleagues, where they would have no choice. If they wanted to get out of the industrial relations system in Victoria or Western Australia under a federal Liberal government they would have to move to New South Wales or Queensland. That is what the situation is. I say that workers have the right to defend themselves and to use whatever tactics necessary to destroy this iniquitous legislation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Cook, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. Has the minister seen reports of dissatisfaction shown by Western Australian industry groups, including the Chamber of Mines and the Small Business and Enterprise Association, with the Court government's second wave industrial legislation? What are the implications of this legislation for Australian industry, particularly for our image with our trading partners? Furthermore, does the minister agree that this legislation, if it were to become a model used by the coalition nationally, would return Australia to the pre-Accord era of conflict in our workplaces?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, let me begin my answer to this question by quoting two statistics. In 1981, when the Fraser government was in power and Mr Howard was the Treasurer of Australia, working days lost per 1,000 employees numbered 797&mdash;797 working days per 1,000 employees. Last year with us in power, the Accord working and industrial harmony coming to Australia, working days lost per 1,000 employees numbered 76 on the same statistic. Under them, 797 working days per 1,000; under us, 76 working days per 1,000. That is an enviable record of industrial achievement: the introduction of industrial harmony, the respect of worker and employer for one another, and the building of a cooperative relationship in the Australian workplace.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of that record, employers and business people in Australia are desperately concerned about the impact of the Western Australian industrial legislation's second wave on the reputation of Australia as a site for foreign investment, on the respect Australia is held in in the world and on the respect of Australia as a reliable trading partner. Many of them said that; perhaps none more eloquently than the front page of the most conservative newspaper in Australia, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, which said in its headlines yesterday `Employers fear impact of IR laws'. That is a quote from one of the most conservative newspapers in Australia, talking about the views of the Australian business community on this legislation. It comes, if you like, deep from within the conservative camp, and it is a view of disquiet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But they are not the only ones. For example, the Chamber of Mines in Western Australia said that the legislation was `too extreme'. A spokesman for the chamber said that they were worried; that the legislation would put in jeopardy the good relations established between employers and employees over many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Small Business and Enterprise Association in Western Australia said of the legislation that it is `excessive, overzealous and provocative'. These fears were shared by the Minister for Resources Development, Mr Barnett, a member of the cabinet that has to consider this legislation. On 5 October he expressed big fears about the impact of the legislation on the investment attractiveness of Western Australia. Yesterday, the Deputy Premier of Western Australia was reported by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> to have said that Western Australian employers were concerned about the impact of the legislation. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, in its editorial, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aspects of this so-called second wave of legislative changes which are at the centre of the dispute seem to have more to do with the ideological drive to disable the union movement than to promote worthwhile industrial practices.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to condemn the minister responsible. We do know that Mr Howard has endorsed this legislation. We do know that Mr Howard and Mr Reith on public radio this morning misled listeners when they said that the legislation has been corrected, when indeed it has not; and the anomalies they said have been changed have not been changed and remain a continuing irritant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, if you go to the details of this legislation&mdash;which is, after all, a blueprint for the federal coalition should it ever come to power&mdash;you can see that good employers, employers who are moral and upright, will be undermined and encouraged to be undermined by unscrupulous employers with no moral convictions whatsoever. This legislation is the cause of considerable unrest in the Australian business community. Senator Parer knows that and people in Australia know that. The business community know that; and they have protested. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that this question should be asked of me by the opposition, in view of the answer Senator Ray gave to a question earlier today from Senator Alston, and in view of the answer I have just given about the concern of the Australian business community and Australian employers about this legislation. The other concern&mdash;indeed, the deeper concern&mdash;about this legislation is that it is a blueprint for what the coalition, in the form of Mr Howard and Mr Reith, would do were they ever to be in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern that is often expressed to me by the Australian business community is that we have come into a period of high industrial harmony in Australia. We have in the workplace, through the accord and through the cooperative arrangements that have been put in place, employers and employees working together to grow the size of the national economy and share the proceeds between them in a way which, through the efforts of both partners, is fully respected. That is a golden achievement by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures that I gave you of 76 working days per thousand lost last year, compared with 797 working days lost through industrial disputation in 1981&mdash;in your period of government&mdash;are a key reason why employers in this country value industrial harmony, hate industrial confrontation and disdain the divisive nature of legislation of this sort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One needs to look at some of the detail of this legislation to understand why people are upset and annoyed by it to the point where they have chosen to take the action in Western Australia that they have. Let me select one part of this legislation which as well as any other part explains what the concern is. In Western Australia, under state awards, back when real records were kept and before the industrial inspectorate was run down and understaffed so that true work by it could never be carried out, there were annually between $4 million to $6 million of underpayments of workers in positions in which they had no protection recovered through the industrial court. That service to the community has been eroded by this government in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation makes sure that that erosion is locked in for all time. If you take away the role of the state in protecting those who are unable to defend themselves, that role falls to the unions. Under this legislation, the right of entry of unions to a workplace to inspect time and wages records is so obstructed as to mean that those union officials cannot obtain the necessary evidence to recover that $4 million to $6 million worth of underpayment that, when true records were kept, was about the amount of underpayment that went to people in positions who could not defend themselves. If you cannot get the evidence because you are obstructed from entering the workplace, you cannot protect the rights of those workers. That is why those workers are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the concern of employers here? If you are in competition with an employer who undercuts his wages and therefore undercuts you in terms of the price of your product because he has broken the award and is unscrupulous, and you are paying the award, the right wages and charging out at that level, you have a government encouragement to unscrupulous employers to destroy the community standing of scrupulous and moral employers and undercut the price of them by dudding their workers on salary. That is one of the key reasons why people on both the employer side of the fence and on the workers side of the fence as well as independent commentators are opposed to this legislation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Jacinta Collins for raising this question. She is right: we have had advice prepared for us, and it should be placed in context. That advice was prepared because the refugee determination process has been considering this issue and that process has asked government to submit advice to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of how the request for advice arose, the Refugee Review Tribunal has been set up under legislation passed by this parliament to be an independent review body for those who seek to challenge refusals of refugee status. It assesses cases before it on a case by case basis and makes up its mind on the basis of the law, the facts and Australia's obligations under the refugees convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tribunal, it must be made clear, does not act at the direction of government. It does, however, seek submissions from my department from time to time to assist it with decision making. As senators will know, the government may appeal decisions of the tribunal and sometimes does so to the Federal Court where particularly important aspects of law are at issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of this process, in February this year, in the context of a case concerning an East Timorese asylum seeker, the tribunal wrote to the secretary to my department asking for submissions from the department on the Portuguese nationality issue. In June it wrote again asking for submissions or information on the issue of the nationality of East Timorese. It raised related citizenship and other nationality issues again in June, July and September this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of citizenship was raised. The question of citizenship is one that is determined by the domestic law of particular countries. My department, in an attempt to settle the citizenship issue once and for all, responded to the request from the tribunal by seeking information from an expert on Portuguese citizenship law, Professor Ramos of the University of Coimbra in Portugal. When that advice was received, the department sought further legal advice from the AG's department about Australia's obligations under the refugees convention. Once that advice was received, it was submitted to the tribunal, as requested, so the tribunal could inform itself of the issue. I table both the AG's advice and Professor Ramos's advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As senators will see, as I have previously said, the advice indicates that, if East Timorese asylum seekers have available to them Portuguese citizenship, Australia does not have protection obligations towards them under the refugees convention unless they exhaust other citizenship rights. This particular aspect arises from the UN definition of refugee, which provides that people have to exhaust all available citizenship rights before obtaining asylum status in a particular country. The advice also makes clear that those who have citizenship available to them are not able to enliven our protection obligations by merely refusing to take up that citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what is the status of the legal advice? It forms the basis of a submission from the department which is forwarded to the Refugee Review Tribunal for consideration by decision makers. Of course, the tribunal and decision makers will each be able to take this into account as well as other relevant factors that are before them in each particular case and make a decision based on the case before them and based also on the international definition of `refugee'.</PARA>

That provides security not only for the market for the automotive industry into the future but also for the people who work in that industry, for Australians who consume their products and for foreigners who buy the exports of this industry in Australia.

Since July 1981, the number of teenage single parent pensioners has fallen from nine per cent to three per cent, so there is absolutely no substance at all to the continuing attack against this group of people. The other interesting statistic that belongs here is the fact that single parent pensioners who are fathers are twice that number&mdash;six per cent&mdash;yet we rarely see the campaign attacking them. It is an attack that is very unfair, very unjust and ill directed against the young women in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing this government has done instead of attacking single parent pensioners&mdash;most of whom arrive at single parent status because of widowhood or divorce&mdash;is to assist them very dramatically with its JET program, for example, which is a very important program, and the Child Support Agency.

Perhaps I should read that advice. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assessment of the paper is seriously flawed. Hamilton and Quiggin derived the suggested net loss to taxpayers of $607 million from an invalid comparison of the risk adjusted return to CSL shareholders with the Commonwealth's risk free borrowing rate. However, CSL's projected earnings as a public entity would not be risk free to the Commonwealth. The blood fractionation facility is highly complex and production failures could occur. There could be poor management. There could be substantial claims against the company through its failure to perform its duty of care if some of its products caused harm and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to direct financial considerations, there are a range of objectives which the government is required to meet with any major asset sale. These include a need to address the value of continued government ownership of a particular GBE in relation to the development of our markets or advances in technology, the promotion of competition in the market thus producing ongoing benefits for consumers, and strengthening the enterprise through producing beneficial synergies with other companies.</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Robert Ray, when given five minutes of opportunity to answer that question, completely refused to do so. The funny thing about it was that he said he did not know anything about it, yet he consumed five minutes of Senate question time on everything that he did not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook happened to have some pieces of paper today from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, and so do I. The heading is, `Keating backs state wide strike'. There we are. Where the government stands is crystal clear. But I think the more disturbing part is that we as Australians are actually very concerned as to where this is all going. Let us face it: we are leading up to a federal election, and this Labor government is hell bent on making sure that there is as much industrial disputation throughout Australia as is humanly possible, and it is going to ensure that its trade union mates&mdash;to whom it gave $5.9 million in the last couple of years, of which it got back $2.2 million at election time, and that is not a bad pay-off&mdash;are called in on their further debts and asked to continue industrial disputation until the date of the next federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is going to grizzle about the industrial disputes record in Western Australia, I intend to put down a few facts. In the electrical, gas and water services area, industrial disputation peaked in 1990 under a Labor government. In that year there happened to be 6,000 working days lost. Last year, 1994, under a Liberal government there happened to be 100 days lost. So there were 5,900 days gained last year by comparison with the Labor peak in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the state government administration area, in 1990 under the Labor government, there were 300 working days lost. In 1993 and 1994 under a state Liberal government there were no days lost. In the health area it peaked in 1989 under&mdash;guess what&mdash;a Labor government at 19,200 days off and, in 1994, under a Liberal government, there were 100 days off. In the education area it peaked under a Labor government in 1989 with 23,600 days off. Last year under a Liberal government there were 100 days off. I notice that the silence is absolutely deafening from the apparatchiks over there because there is no disputing these industrial disputes figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is not bad enough, in the public order and safety area, it peaked under Labor in 1989 at 200 days off and, in two years under a Liberal government, 1993 and 1994, there were no days lost&mdash;not one. So the peak of industrial disputation occurred under the former Labor government of the failed Premier, Dr Carmen Lawrence&mdash;she probably cannot remember these figures any more&mdash;in 1989, under a Labor government, when it totalled 47,800 working days off as compared with 1994, last year, under a Liberal government, 1,100 days off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there you have the stark contrast. Yet what we are going to see is this Labor government holding this country to ransom every day they possibly can between now and the next election to make sure that they can run their scare campaign&mdash;a frightful, lying, deceitful, horrible, nasty, scare campaign. Of course, we know that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is absolutely superb at doing that. He did it in 1993 and he plans to do it again prior to this next election, whenever it may be held, and he does not care about the cost to the country. He does not care a continental about the cost to Western Australia, a state that produces so much wealth that he is prepared to sacrifice on the altar of his electoral prospects. I find that absolutely and utterly despicable. </PARA>

Australia was behind all those countries in percentage terms, and in absolute terms it also lagged very badly. For example, in 1992 the figure for Australia was 153 days lost compared with the United States, 40 days; France, 30 days; the United Kingdom, 20 days; and Sweden, 10 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, there are signs that Labor's claimed historic low in industrial disputes&mdash;the Prime Minister is peddling that around&mdash;may be only temporary. The 12 months to October 1994 saw the lowest average of working days lost per thousand employees due to industrial disputes&mdash;and that was 61. Since October 1994 the trend has rebounded. The 12 months to June 1995 saw the figure rise to 86. By the same measure Queensland, whose industrial relations legislation mirrors that of the federal Labor government, is indisputably the industrial dispute centre of Australia. It had 159 working days lost per thousand employees for the 12 months ended June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, in Australia the global trend towards lower industrial disputation flattened out at a higher plane than did most of our major trading partners and OECD partners. The trend has now reversed and is actually increasing. So Senator Cook's claims today, mirroring Prime Minister Keating's claims of yesterday, are a patent mistruth. We should not be at all surprised at that, because who on earth believes this Prime Minister any more? Of course, no-one here has ever believed Senator Cook. </PARA>

When Senator Cooney spoke a moment ago, he asked a very appropriate question of the opposition; that is, if the record in Western Australia was so good, why was this legislation introduced by the Western Australian government necessary? Why was this so-called second wave industrial legislation brought in?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real reason why it has been introduced is that the Western Australian Liberal government under Premier Court and Minister Kierath really hate unions. They are setting out to destroy trade unions and workers' representation. That is what they are doing. The legislation is unfair, discriminatory and vindictive. It breaches internationally accepted principles of freedom of association. It is draconian and it is economically and industrially irresponsible. If you are not prepared to take my word for that because you may think I have a bit of a bias, coming from the Labor Party and trade union side, I would like to remind members of the opposition that this legislation has been roundly condemned by many leading conservative commentators on industrial legislation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have had a number of headlines quoted. Senator Knowles delighted in quoting and I would like to refer to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 31 August this year by Professor Judith Sloan. Everyone in the community knows that Professor Judith Sloan is one of the leading proponents and supporters of the conservative parties' industrial relations agenda. But even Professor Judith Sloan is reported to have said in an article, `Court's second wave IR reforms must be rejected.' I would like to quote some extracts from what Professor Sloan said. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Advocates of genuine labour market reform in Australia should strongly oppose some of the policy changes being proposed as part of the so-called "second wave" industrial relations package of the West Australian Government.

<PARA>Finally:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal Liberals need to distance themselves from these proposals. The main game is to implement policy based firmly on the principles of freedom to contract and freedom of association. Actions that amount to unwarranted government interference in the workings of unions should be ruled out immediately.</PARA>
<PARA>In response to Senator Short's comment, certainly there have been some changes, but the essential thrust of the legislation still remains, which is that it is an attempt to do nothing more than destroy trade unions, which are a legitimate part of any democratic society. It is about time that you took a little notice of what some of your own supporters are saying about industrial relations legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not very often agree with Professor Judith Sloan, but at least on this matter I do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right now all we know is what your policy was at the last election. You keep trying to shift around in the sand and keep your head down and not do anything or say anything, but we know that primarily your position is that there will be a single minimum hourly rate. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, has said on behalf of the coalition that the Western Australian industrial relations package is the coalition's model and that that is what they will have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially what that will bring to the working people of Australia is a single minimum hourly wage. It is worth noting that the Victorian government&mdash;and Mr Howard also supports their industrial relations program&mdash;sought to apply to the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria to have a minimum hourly rate of $8.30. It is not quite the $3 which the opposition said it was going to have as the youth wage last time. They are now saying, `We are not going to have a $3 per hour wage this time.' They do not know whether it is going to be $3 or $3.50 or $4. </PARA>

None of the things along those lines will be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth noting how well the industrial relations program, which is proposed by the opposition, has worked in Victoria.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Minchin this day, relating to the car industry and taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked about the car industry in August and referred to the drop in sales in July. The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) said at that time, `Sales always drop in July. You have to expect this sort of thing to happen.' Now we have the sales figures for September and they show that car sales dropped by 12 1/2 per cent compared with August and that they are down 3.9 per cent on the September 1994 figures. So even in seasonally adjusted terms clearly the car industry is suffering considerably from the increase in the wholesale sales tax on cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly what the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industry said in a statement on 6 October. It said that sales in new motor vehicles fell sharply in September as the full impact of the wholesale sales tax increases in the May federal budget were felt. They went on to say that the decrease is a further reflection of the industry's plight with respect to the after effects of the sales tax increases. They have nailed the real cause for this dramatic slump in car sales in Australia. They go on to point out, despite what the minister has given us by way of answer, that there has been absolutely no growth in the Australian car industry in the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, after 12 years of this Labor government, the car industry is stuck in a groove. The sales for 1995 are expected to be no more than sales of cars in 1985. We have had a significant increase in population, yet there has been no growth in this industry, partly, as the chamber itself says, because of the sales tax increases which this government has put on to it. What has actually happened is that in the 1995 budget the tax was increased by virtually one-third, from 16 per cent to 21 per cent, and then another one per cent on 1 July, taking the total tax to 22 per cent on motor vehicles. That is a one-third increase in the tax that ordinary Australians have to pay to purchase a new motor vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst part of this is the appalling broken promise that this represents. On 26 February 1992 the Prime Minister said, `From tomorrow, the sales tax on new cars currently subjected to the 20 per cent rate will be permanently lowered to 15 per cent.' He went on to proclaim the virtues of that reduction in tax. He said it was a permanent reduction. Once the 1993 election was out of the way&mdash;a couple of years have passed, of course&mdash;`Well, that was a countercyclical measure and now it's time to increase the tax.' It is a most outrageous broken promise. It was one of the most deceitful things that were said before the 1992 campaign. It was done by the government in a panic, simply to match the tax of 15 per cent that we were proposing to put on motor vehicles. Of course, the effect of this outrageous broken promise is to put a $1,200 increase on the price of a new Falcon or Holden. This is the government that professes to look after the battlers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so such of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Chamarette from moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely, a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 1839, standing in the name of Senator Chamarette for this day, relating to consideration of the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>I am seeking to suspend standing orders today because on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> is a bill which has enormous ramifications for Australia's human rights and environment record and our standing in the world community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion which I wish to put to the Senate would remove the Administrative Decisions (Effects of International Instruments) Bill 1995 from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and be redrafted. There are several reasons why this is vitally important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an extremely serious matter to suggest that a bill be withdrawn from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. We have not considered this lightly. However, this bill, which was listed in the motion that I gave notice of yesterday as No. 14 on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, is bad law making. We will not be a party to this chamber compromising its integrity and processes without some protest. The bill has made a mockery of our Senate committee system, it does not have the substantial backing of any part of the Australian community and its continuing existence, let alone enactment, is damaging Australia's international reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of the Senate legal and constitutional committee's inquiry into this bill calls into question the Senate committee process. The vast majority of written and oral submissions, bar that of the Attorney-General's Department, opposed the bill and opposed it in strident terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Elizabeth Evatt, in her oral submission to the committee, made this comment about the bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It gives the message that we have no reasonable expectation that our government will comply with obligations that it has undertaken. I would be ashamed to have to say that at an international forum.</PARA>
<PARA>Joseph O'Reilly of the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties said, `the Teoh bill is something which is regrettable and fundamentally flawed'. Robert Ludbrook of the National Children's and Youth Law Centre said the bill was `misconceived' and should be withdrawn. Chris Sidotti, the Human Rights Commissioner, said the bill was `unnecessary', `undesirable' and introduced `logical inconsistencies into federal law'. He went on to say, `It is a retreat from Australia's good record in supporting international human rights treaties.' I could go on but I have  only the briefest of time to outline the urgency of this motion I am seeking to put to the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be fair, the committee report adequately sets out the opposition to the bill. This, however, makes it even more surprising that the majority committee recommendations ignore the input of highly respected representatives of the Australian community. The only people arguing for this bill are politicians. A committee process which so blatantly ignores community input lacks any credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of the parliament to be a conduit for community views has meant that a coalition of community, religious and industry groups have come together to oppose the bill. Later this week these groups will unveil a campaign against this retrograde legislation. This chamber should not be party to a debate on a bill which so blatantly fails to represent the wishes of the people. The bill is shoddy law making. We need to engage in a meaningful consultation process which leads to a comprehensive approach to Australia's international obligations&mdash;not a piecemeal one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this bill remains on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> our international standing will deteriorate. If the bill passes, this deterioration will accelerate, ultimately threatening to destroy any positive work the government has done in international human rights and environmental arenas.

I quite understand a number of the issues raised by Senator Chamarette, but not one of those issues indicates to me why this motion should be dealt with now. In debating with Senator Chamarette we could say that we have as strong an interest in the treaty making foreign affairs power as Senator Chamarette and the government may have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have clearly defined policy differences with the government on a whole range of issues in this area. We have been saying for quite some time that the government has gone about the treaty making process in a haphazard and cavalier way and that it has not realised the consequences of its actions. This bill that Senator Chamarette is now saying is so urgent is in response to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) finding out that some of the things he was telling the community about the impact of signing treaties and being a party to conventions were simply incorrect. The Attorney-General has now introduced a bill to remedy the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette does not want that bill to be dealt with. Why should her views on that bill take precedence over our views on a whole range of bills that are here to be dealt with? There are a number of family law bills in my portfolio that I would like to see dealt with. There is the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 1994 (1995), which has strangely fallen to the bottom of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. That bill would allow corruption to be listed as a class 2 offence. I could argue here that that bill is more important than any other bill on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> at the moment because it will allow the Wood royal commission to gain access to a far wider range of telephone intercept information than it is now able to get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corruption is not listed as an offence in relation to the telecommunications interception bill. That means that some of the information that the commission can get is not so much second-hand as second-order information. It is information that law enforcement agencies come across because they have an intercept on a drug runner, a murderer, or whatever. They cannot undertake an intercept first off because of corruption. If they could, there would be a lot more information available to the Wood royal commission in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It begs the question why this government introduced the bill. The government had a clear indication from us that we would support the bill. However, the bill has been moved to the bottom of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. I understand the sense of urgency that Senator Chamarette tries to bring to this matter, but the debate on the treaty making process is not going to go away. Undoubtedly it will be an issue at the election. I do not see why it should be dealt with today over and above other items such as the telecommunications interception bill where time is running out. There is a clock on the Wood royal commission in New South Wales and it could be that if that bill is not passed there will be information on corruption in the Australian Federal Police and the New South Wales police force that does not come to light and is not brought before the commission. The reason for that is that the government has put the bill far lower down the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> than I believe it should be placed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could come in here tomorrow and move a motion and take up half an hour of the Senate's time making the case that I believe that that bill should be higher up the order. But if each shadow minister and the Democrats&mdash;as they rotate their membership around the phone box, putting on one shadow minister's hat one day and another shadow minister's hat the next&mdash;came in and moved a motion to change the order on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> to put on a bill that they think is most urgent, we would never deal with any of the bills that we all agree are urgent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette just has to accept that the bill provides a mechanism for debate on this bill. It will be debated. It is not as if lives are going to be lost. It is not as if information on corrupt police officers is going to be lost. Information on corruption will be lost if the telecommunications interception bill is not passed. Senator Chamarette will get her chance to have this debate at a proper time. Bad luck that you do not win government in the lower house. I hope that when we win government in the lower house we will be able to control the agenda. The stunning reality that has to dawn on Senator Chamarette is that those people over there sadly won a majority in the lower house and formed a government and they have the opportunity to control the agenda. Those opposite control the agenda and we do not agree with their priority in respect of this bill. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

There was not a single voice amongst all the witnesses before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which expressed a view that this bill should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns they expressed were twofold. Firstly, Australia is obviously going to be held in very low esteem indeed by the global community when we say, `Yes, we will sign this treaty. We will even ratify it. But no, we don't want our decision makers, our public officials, to take any notice of it. We want them to ignore it.' Over the years we have had a process where human rights standards as reflected in international treaties and in international law have gradually been adopted by the legal systems of the various countries, including Australia. In Australia, international law as a persuasive authority has certainly been taken account of in judicial decisions and in the further development of our common law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this action the government simply wants to put a stop to that process and deliver us to a position in the world community where people will point their fingers at us and say, `They say one thing in this treaty but they don't intend to abide by it because they are saying to their public officials, "Ignore it.

We get all these preachy statements about the government not organising its programs, that it did not bring the legislation in early enough. There are 31 bills if you want to get to work, so don't, for heaven's sake, come in here in six or eight weeks time, or whenever it is, and say that we did not have our program ready. They are there listed on the red, and we are ready to debate them.

One of the other competing priorities is the 31 bills, one of which you object to, that are on this particular list. As far as the government is concerned, we should get on with the Senate business and deal with some of these things. Today, of course, we had Senator Spindler let the cat out of the bag when he said that this is a stunt to get some of the substantive matters debated here in the hope they will influence some of the senators here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The starting point is to ask why standing orders need to be suspended on an urgent basis to canvass the motion that Senator Chamarette puts to the Senate. That motion, in paragraph (a), basically criticises the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill as put by the government and, in paragraph (b), resolves that the bill should be discharged from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and redrafted. The question, of course, is: where is the urgency in that? Why should that be dealt with today and not canvassed when the bill comes before the Senate within the next fortnight, or perhaps within the fortnight's sitting after that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that in relation to this bill Senator Chamarette and Senator Spindler take a different point of view from the opposition and the government. However, the question is simply one of urgency. Why should we deal with the bill today rather than when it comes before the Senate? I fail to see where the urgency is in having this matter debated today and having the bill struck from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. What prejudice would the Australian people suffer by not having this matter debated today? That really is the question that should be asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next two or three weeks I doubt that any decision will be made by a Commonwealth decision maker, or any treaty or convention entered into by Australia, that would have ramifications which would be prejudicial to the Australian people. I fail to see where Australia would suffer internationally by not having this matter debated today rather than when the bill comes on. As the minister has stated, when the bill comes on, the matter can be debated more fully and the matter of substance can be discussed. </PARA>

<PARA>I put to the Senate that that was the understanding of the government, of the wider community and, I stress, of the judicial system in this country until the case of Teoh. This bill simply seeks to reinforce what was understood until the Teoh decision. There is nothing new or drastic being brought in by this bill; nothing which is cataclysmic by nature. It simply restates what people understood the law to be. Therefore, this question of urgency does not really arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fail to see why standing orders should be suspended to debate the question of striking this from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The implications here are that only one department&mdash;that is, the Attorney-General's Department&mdash;has actually looked at the implications of the bill. The urgency is that Australia has signed thousands of treaties, and either all or part of any treaty may no longer have legal standing in the courts of Australia. That means that the individual will not have the ability to utilise those thousands of treaties, including the International Labor Organisation&mdash;anything warm and fuzzy that Australia has ever signed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the urgency here. It is urgent because it has been slipped unobtrusively onto the agenda. It is rapidly reaching a conclusion without the general community having any idea of its ramifications. It is urgent because the Lib-Lab coalition here has decided that it will disregard the vast majority of extremely well-informed community organisations and individuals who have made submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Raising it as a matter of urgency is not a stunt&mdash;as Senator Ray has accused Senator Spindler and, by inference, Senator Chamarette. It is a legitimate approach and is necessary to draw the attention of the community to something that the government and opposition are about to perpetrate by their numbers. I do not believe that the majority of people on this side of the house even know the implications, and I believe it has not even been discussed in caucus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The urgency is that the ramifications are such that it is so dangerous in relation to the treaties that have been signed and will no longer have standing in a court. Let us think, for instance, about the Ramsar treaties, the wetlands treaties&mdash;all of those for which the only last resort for people is the implication that the court may be able to take those into consideration if any court decision were made. That is not there, and you have wiped it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the urgency were there electorally, it is because we will be telling the voters loud and clear what you have done by taking this decision unthinkingly and not even allowing your own departments to look at the ramifications of what you are doing in this bill. It is urgent because the community deserves the right to know what the government and the coalition are doing between them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the opposition does not want the federal government to make the treaty powers. We know that. We did not actually know that about the government until today. It will mean that both of the major parties in the future may go more easily into treaties. But they may not be worth the paper they are written on, because anybody who does not want human rights, who does not like obligations on the environment, who does not want to see the world working together on the things we must do, will be able to block that by simply using state governments to block international progress on things we must do in order to survive as a planet. Therefore, it is a day that must be noted as urgent, and it is a day which we believe this side of the chamber will live to regret. We know the opposition's views on treaties already. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of the Prime Minister to condemn the political and economic blockade of Western Australia by supporting the Trades &amp; Labour Council ahead of the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA>In rising to address this issue I would like to place it clearly on the public record that there is a necessity for this motion before the chamber today because the Labor government led by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others have decided on a political response to a situation in another state which they do not agree with. I want to parallel that with what occurred following the last election when we had a similar situation. We had what was known at that time as the Victorian IR legislation and Western Australian legislation&mdash;which is now for some reason being called the first wave of the legislation. We also had the government's Industrial Relations Reform Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, the government's response to a situation we did not agree with was a legislative response in the form of overriding state legislation by using ILO conventions, external affairs powers and a number of other legislative responses. That is the correct response if they disagree with a particular situation at a particular time. But for us to have a situation where the federal government&mdash;led by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), and Senator Ray and Senator Cook here in the chamber today&mdash;in refusing to condemn a political and economic blockade of a state, in this case, my state of Western Australia, is one of the lowest points that the political situation has reached in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As time goes by they will very much regret the decision they have taken because it is the worst form of the rule of anarchy that one could possibly think of. It will also test the mettle of some of the Western Australians on the other side of the chamber&mdash;and everyone in this chamber. Would they prefer that type of response to something that they disagree with or the position they took following the last election? I say, `Shame on them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem is that Mr Keating, as we know, is in trouble in terms of his current political position. He has chosen to use this type of route to try to get out of it. It is not really the Western Australians who are orchestrating this; when you dig into the depths, you find it is the Transport Workers Union, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Keating and Mr Kelty who are the architects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had there been the provisions which are being put into the Western Australian legislation of secret ballots there would be no strike or boycott today. In fact, it would have been absolutely and totally defeated in Western Australia by enormous numbers of trade union members because they do not want it. In fact, they reject this action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it had not been for the TWU putting some picket lines up today, the boycott would have failed. They had to physically move in to stop a number of people taking up their normal work positions and carrying out their normal services to the Western Australian community. The Prime Minister is not accepting his national responsibility in terms of what is good for the nation; he is putting in place his own political agenda and taking sides in this case with a small section of the trade union movement. If he had not done this in the way he has done, we would not be debating this motion today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite certain, as I said earlier, that as time goes by we will find that government ministers will regret the position they have taken in this matter. It is a very tragic day. I want to quote one of the press comments today. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A blockade of any state is an act of economic vandalism, but a blockade of Australia's top performing exporting state is simply economic suicide.</PARA>
<PARA>That quote really highlights the depths to which this government will go at this time in their scaremongering campaign for the next election. It will do no good for them or the economy of Australia. Even more, it will do no good for the people of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It poses this question: why would Prime Minister Keating take this stance when we are dealing with the best performing economic state in this country? Last year, the state had a $11 billion surplus on its current account, that is its exports over imports. Contrast that with the total $26 billion deficit that we have at the federal level. Look at unemployment. In Western Australia, youth unemployment is 10 percentage points below the national average. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. Reform has to go on. You have misrepresented that reform. Unemployment in this state is one per cent below the national average. By far and away it has been the best performing state economically over the last two or three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why change the system? Why would people be frightened of things such as a secret ballot? You change the system so that events like those of today cannot occur unless the majority of people involved want them to occur. Why should anybody walk away from or be frightened of a secret ballot? Why should anybody be concerned about people having the opportunity to determine where their political donations go? There is nothing wrong with that. These types of things have been described as draconian. That is not draconian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is draconian is the failure of previous Labor governments in Western Australia, in not having repealed the Masters and Servants Act 1892, the Truck Act 1899 or the Trade Union Act 1902. One could go on with what is being repealed and replaced in this legislation. The bottom line is that the changes are very minor. But that is not even the point. I respect the right of those opposite to disagree with points of that legislation, but I do not respect their right to support an economic boycott in a state for political purposes, particularly when that state is the one I come from. That is what is wrong with the actions of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 24 or 36 hours, Mr Keating and Mr Beazley have tried to wriggle out of their earlier position by saying that they neither support nor condone it. That is very different from the positions they are reported to have put last week, even if they were partially misrepresented then. I do not believe they were, because I have talked to some of the people who were at the functions and meetings where these things were said. Mr Keating and Mr Beazley have put one foot on each side of a barbed wire fence. At least Mr Brereton said that he supported the position in Western Australia; he made it quite clear. But he is absolutely and totally wrong in the position he took. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the position they hold, they are now not prepared to say that this is not the way business should be done in Australia. We should not have to put up with the damage that is being done to the economy in Western Australia and which will flow into the Australian economy. We should not have to put up with the damage that is being done to our overall international representation. These reforms in Western Australia are being carried through. If a response was required from the federal government, it should have been a legislative response. This government should not be supporting a blockade of the state of Western Australia all because of the position that it now finds itself in with regard to the forthcoming election. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all in code. Those opposite talk about freeing up the labour market. That is code for bringing in draconian legislation to control workers. We know on the record that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) supported the first wave of legislation in Western Australia. But it was only today that I understood he supported the second wave. On the Sattler program, he said, `There are features of the legislation which coincide with ours.' We do not know whether he is telling the truth because he will not publish his policy. He has worked it out. He said that he has all the details done but that he will not publish them. So we do not know whether his public comment today about the Kierath legislation in Western Australia being similar to federal Liberal Party policy is true because they do not have the fortitude to debate those issues in public. They do not have confidence in their policy to be able to sustain it in a public debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that Mr Howard has been going around the country talking to business groups about it. Here is a quote from Mr Howard from last September:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the greatest advantages of my having laid out an industrial relations program over such a long period of time is that if I win the election nobody can deny I have a mandate to change industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mr Howard is saying that he will return to his old policies. He is going back to the sorts of policies he espoused as a shadow minister under John Hewson when going into the last election. He is going back to all his old tricks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's approach to state and federal industrial relations legislation fails to acknowledge the fundamental economic and social benefits that come from social cohesion. A fair and equitable industrial relations system is a necessary precondition to an efficient one. Fairness and equity are essential for commitment to participating effectively at the enterprise level. There are obviously significant broader ramifications for productivity growth and inflation and thus for macro-economic policy and employment. The whole economic and social fabric is threatened by conflictive, anti-worker approaches to industrial relations policy that the Liberal Party has consistently adopted at the federal and state levels, marked most by Western Australia and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fractured industrial relations environment in a national setting would reverse all the gains made towards a participative culture encouraged by the accord process. That has delivered a threshold cut to the rate of inflation to less than three per cent over three years compared with 11 per cent when we came into office in 1983. There has been a dramatic fall in the number of strikes, from an average of over 590 working days lost per year under the coalition to much less than half that on average since 1983 under us. This year has seen the lowest number of strikes and days lost since 1940. For 55 years, under our guidance it is the lowest. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have the lowest number of days lost in 55 years. In the macro-economic settings, which have allowed a very healthy and sustained economic and employment growth over the last few years, over two million jobs have been created since 1983. That was partly because of the industrial relations environment created by this government. We should remember that these social and economic achievements cannot be achieved within the sort of conflictive approach that coalition parties always take to these matters. John Howard consistently supports the antagonistic policy which is reflected in Western Australia and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victoria is relevant because the Court government has modelled a lot of its legislation on the Victorian legislation. This is what Mr Kennett, the Premier of Victoria, said on the subject of the Victorian industrial relations system&mdash;and you should listen if you do not know. Do I have to remind you what the Liberal Party in Victoria, your colleagues, has done? This is the one with minimum wages only and no compensation for loss of overtime rates, penalty rates or holiday leave loading, even though the court has knocked over the latter one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workers in Victoria have been leaving in droves to go to federal awards, but not under Western Australian legislation. If you leave, your union gets tossed out. If you return, the government minister allocates which union you will go to. That is under your system. Have a look at the system of fines under the ballot thing and see how draconian it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is miserable anti-worker legislation. It does give you a thrill to do this because you achieve a lifetime ambition of kicking workers. That is what the coalition, the Liberal Party, enjoys. The true Liberal Party comes out. It is very hard to get a measure on the federal Liberal Party's policy. The one area where there is absolute concurrence is in the federal and state areas of industrial relations. That is the one area where we are entitled to deduce how Liberals would behave in power if they are going to hide their policies. We have seen them in action in Western Australia and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kennett said, `A federal Liberal Party would implement the policies which his government has tried to implement.' He also said that once the coalition was elected the Victorian employees would have nowhere to go. In other words, an industrial relations iron curtain would come down over the four southern states&mdash;the AFL states. You would have them trapped by federal and state legislation. Glory be, wouldn't you enjoy that? Would you not enjoy bringing in legislation that had them trapped? Are you going to put guards on the Murray River to stop them going to New South Wales and Queensland to escape your laws? Are you going to go that far?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are you so anti-worker? What drives you to a sort of crypto-corporate state approach to these matters? Every time you get into power you have to bring in this sort of legislation. I will tell you what it is: it is the demons of the past. It is a fact that the workers and trade unionists of this country have not supported you. You think by kicking workers you will somehow get some sort of sycophantic reaction from the employers. The fact is a lot of them do not like your industrial relations. A lot of employers in Victoria and Western Australia just see it as another way of ripping apart the social fabric. They just see it as another way of doing bad business in a state. You cannot help yourselves. </PARA>

The people of Australia are already sick of it. They do not want to hear the rhetoric anymore. They do not want to know any more that emphasises the mess that could result if these extremities are followed. The answer is not in the extremities that are being delineated by both participants in this phoney campaign. The tactics that are being used by both sides, including today's union blockade and whether there is any honesty and accountability on the part of the political leaders involved regarding what they are saying and doing about industrial relations policy, are really what the public is looking for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats do not support the use of excessive industrial action to achieve inappropriate results. However, unlike the coalition, we recognise that the withdrawal of labour by workers is a legitimate response when negotiation falls down and the other party is being unreasonable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not entirely persuaded that today's blockade is the best means to resolve the problem. The problem is entirely of the making of the Western Australian government. Here we have a government responding to a non-existent problem of alleged union militancy with an excessive and extreme package of laws for which they have no electoral mandate. Worse, the package of laws breaches several international ILO conventions and stands Australia up for world condemnation. In the same way Senator Crane is concerned about our international reputation, we should be concerned about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the national interest for Australian industrial relations, and the Australian public at large, for our industrial relations to be conducted as amicably as possible. This can only happen with both unions and employers feeling they are part of the equation. Policies which seek to marginalise unions cannot achieve industrial harmony, just as policies which seek to dictate to employers what they can and cannot do cannot foster meaningful negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the 13-year life of the various accords, Australia appears to have dragged itself out of the quagmire of unnecessary confrontations in the industrial relations system towards a more consensual one. I cannot say that we have reached that end point. The accord process does have its warts. The processes which exist at the moment still can be described as cumbersome but at least we can point to some successes and to the possibility of the industrial relations system working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Edwards from the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry recently noted that Australian workers are very wary of change and reform and that change is needed to hasten slowly at a rate at which the employees are comfortable. Plenty of other major employers have given similar messages about the rate of change. I would hasten to add that at the moment there is no clamouring, no massive need for dramatic and radical IR reform in this country. The only people calling for it are the ideologues on the right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We even have conservative commentators, as we have heard earlier today, such as Professor Judith Sloan, who said that the Western Australian reforms go too far too quickly.

He was right. He is worse than Jeff Kennett. He has exceeded his mandate for policy change and gone well beyond what the WA electorate elected him to do. In doing so, he has followed the path already blazed by Mr Kennett and Dean Brown in promising moderation but delivering reactionary extremism in industrial relations policy. He might have also damaged the election chances of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, who is trying to persuade the electorate that, after 10 years of calling for radical industrial relations reform, he has changed his mind and he now supports mild and moderate tinkering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone in Victoria, South Australia and now Western Australia who believes that must believe in Santa Claus. If Mr Howard and his promises of new-found moderation on industrial relations are to be believed, he must come out and condemn Premier Court and Minister Kierath for misleading the electors of WA about their IR plans.

Even he is aware of the strategy and the tactic that this Labor government is using&mdash;the fear campaign, the lie campaign, all a regurgitation of what happened prior to the 1993 state and federal elections.

They got on this bandwagon, aided and abetted by Mr Laurie Brereton and aided and abetted by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is no good saying the Prime Minister is neutral in this case.

You cannot be neutral when any part of the Commonwealth is being attacked.

That is the trade surplus from Western Australia. If you divide that amount by 250, which is about the number of working days in a year, it comes out at about $44 million a day net surplus that Western Australia supplies to Australia. If it were not for Western Australia, the deficit for Australia would be over $3.25 billion a month. This blockade is doing at least $44 million damage today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose Senator Crane's motion. In doing so, I must say I am incredulous at the argument that has been placed before us today. Essentially, the Liberal Party's argument is that the second wave legislation in Western Australia is all part of some federal ALP plot to put industrial relations on the agenda. The simple way to get this issue off the agenda is for them to withdraw the legislation. It is a Liberal state government initiative. It is the most draconian and anti-worker legislation seen in this country. It amounts to a fundamental attack on the rights of workers to organise themselves, to collectively bargain and to be represented by trade unions. It is in the Liberals' hands to take the issue off the agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from being a Labor plot, the Labor Party expresses sympathy for workers in Western Australia. It understands the position they have taken in withdrawing their labour. It is the only way they are able to demonstrate to the state government the seriousness of the issue and their deep concern. To that extent, we understand the position adopted in Western Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on the Court government's head that it has come to this. It is a shame that they have been driven by the ideologies of Mr Court and of Mr Kierath. I suppose I must take some blame for that because, in a former life as a trade union official, I used to inspect Mr Kierath's time and wages records when he was a contract cleaning employer. I must take my share of the blame for his paranoia about trade unions having access to time and wages records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on the record some of the key issues in this debate rather than carry on the sort of rhetorical debate we have had so far. The fact is that the first wave of industrial legislation introduced by the Court government was aimed at introducing individual contracts into the workplaces of Western Australia. Mr Howard has endorsed the approach adopted in Western Australia in the first wave and today went further and seemed to endorse the second wave as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the first wave of industrial relations legislation in Western Australia was to undermine and replace awards with individual contracts. The whole direction of the legislation sought to have awards replaced by workers signing individual contracts with their employer. The legislation removed the role of unions in that process, made the process secret, avoided any scrutiny of that process and ensured that the employer negotiated one on one with each of his employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The claim by the Liberal Party is that that provides choice and freedom to the employees but the reality, of course, is quite different. There have been two features to the reality in Western Australia. The first is that, in highly unionised well-paid areas of the work force, employers have essentially sought to buy out trade unionism. They have offered workers individual contracts that provide better conditions than the award and have bought the loyalty of the work force with a higher total package on individual contracts. They have in a sense bought the unions out of the system. That was anticipated by the trade union movement. The trade union movement recognises that it has to have new strategies to deal with that sort of approach. Eventually, I think it will regain membership in these areas where individual contracts have been used to encourage workers to leave trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second tenet of the legislation has been for low paid and largely unskilled workers to be exploited by having individual contracts offered to them by their employers. These contracts are made in secrecy. There is no public scrutiny of these individual contracts. It is quite clear that those contracts have been used in many industries&mdash;particularly with the young, with women and with unskilled workers&mdash;to drive down the package of pay and conditions that is available to those workers. A good deal of evidence about those individual workplace agreements has been coming to light. At a later stage I will present some of those examples to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if anyone is in any doubt about what that legislation does in the first wave, I want to put it on the record once again. The Trades and Labour Council of Western Australia obtained a legal opinion on the impact of that first wave of the legislation from Ian Viner QC, a former Liberal minister. He provided a very thorough legal opinion on what that first wave of industrial relations reform legislation did. I quote part of the legal opinion of Ian Viner QC:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation does not protect prospective employees who wish to be employed pursuant to an award rather than a workplace agreement in circumstances where the prospective employer requires that they enter into a workplace agreement as a precondition to employment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A former Liberal minister for industrial relations providing his legal opinion that, in fact, the choice or the freedom that Mr Howard endorses does not occur; that employees are open to exploitation; that they are in an unfair bargaining position; and that the individual contracts can be used by employers in a very unbalanced and unfair way to drive down wages and conditions and make employees agree to those conditions. The legal opinion goes much further into all the examples and circumstances that that legislation permits. A former Liberal minister has made it clear that the system that Mr Howard and the opposition support is about exploitation of workers. That is what individual contracts is doing and that is what Mr Howard has tied the opposition to by endorsing that first wave of industrial relations legislation in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Reith has gone on to try to provide some protection for the Liberal Party in terms of its industrial relations policy by claiming that he will support a no disadvantage test and some basic minimum conditions of employment. It is very educational to look at what the minimum conditions of employment in Western Australia provide&mdash;in the sense that this is the example of industrial relations policy that Mr Howard has endorsed. When one looks at those minimum conditions of employment in Western Australia, one finds that one can drive a truck through those conditions. It provides, for instance, that casual employees are not entitled to minimum conditions of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing in WA is a whole range of employees being offered regular weekly work under workplace contracts provided that they are classified as casuals. This means that they are not entitled to the protection of the minimum conditions of employment act and they are not protected from having their wages, their hours, their annual leave, et cetera protected. Provided they are classified as a casual employee, even though they might have been working there for years, they get no protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, WA workers get no protection by way of enforcement. Mr Kierath has written to the miscellaneous workers union in Western Australia indicating that the workplace commissioner, the supposed watchdog of these minimum conditions, is not obliged to alter any agreement which does not provide the minimum conditions. The commissioner is required to advise the employer and the employee that they do not meet the minimum conditions but he will register an agreement that does not meet the minimums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this is the Liberal protection: this is the protection they offer the workers. The loopholes through the minimum conditions in Western Australia are so wide as to give no protection at all to a worker offered a workplace agreement by an employer. There is no recourse; there is no union protection; there is no protection provided by the workplace commissioner in terms of their rights; and it seems that there are no minimum conditions of employment. If you are a casual employee, you are not entitled to anything other than bereavement leave, which is not much comfort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another educational example of the minimums that apply in Western Australia relates to the minimum wage. The Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission is now required to recommend to the state minister the appropriate minimum weekly wage. It recently recommended that it be increased from $301.10 to $325.40. Mr Kierath, the state industrial relations minister&mdash;who has given himself the power to set minimum wages in Western Australia&mdash;rejected the industrial commission's recommendation, rejected the umpire's recommendation, and fixed the new minimum wage at $317.10. This is some 30 per cent less than the increase recommended. He claimed in parliament that his actions were justified by a report from a Professor David Plowman, whom he had employed as an industrial relations expert to provide advice. Yet what we find out subsequently is that Professor Plowman recommended that the minimum weekly wage should be no lower than $330&mdash;even higher than the minimum which the industrial commission recommended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you give the Liberal Party the power to set minimums, first, they make sure they are not enforceable and, second, when it comes to the minimum wage they will not accept the industrial commission's recommendation; they strike a lower rate. This is the same old Liberal Party that argued for $3 an hour and who argued for no protection for workers. They support individual contracts in Western Australia because that allows exploitation of workers, exploitation of the young, exploitation of the unskilled and exploitation of women&mdash;exploitation of those who have no bargaining power.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is one of a series of audit reports by the Australian National Audit Office. Mr Acting Deputy President, as you are aware, the Audit Office has been the subject of much discussion in this place, particularly about the level of resourcing it has been allocated and the extent of its independence. Undoubtedly, there is a great need for the Audit Office and I for one have been a great defender of its activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, I want to note that, clearly, this audit into the Department of Social Security regional office resourcing and benefit processing will be of benefit to the department itself. The fact is that a very large amount of money is involved in these regional offices. As this report reveals, in 1994-95 the salary and administrative costs for regional offices were about $560 million, of which the great bulk, $460 million, was salary costs alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Office found&mdash;and I just highlight a couple of their findings&mdash;that there is an appreciable scope for improving the allocation of resources across the regional office network; client services could be improved if the time of operations staff in the regional office is directed more to quality service delivery; and there are gains to be made from identifying and moving towards internal best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It makes this particular finding, which is of some concern, that client service in some offices falls well below Department of Social Security standards. Another finding, which should be highlighted, is that there is scope for improvement in the collection of information from clients and that the key performance indicators of regional offices need to be better focused on results required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One problem here is that the Audit Office was not able to independently assess&mdash;I notice a split infinitive there; so I direct that to the attention of the Auditor-General&mdash;whether regional offices are appropriately resourced as DSS could not provide the data needed by the Audit Office on the full range of work loads. I must say that does seem to be quite surprising. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only had this Auditor-General's report No. 4 of 1995-96 for some very short while. I think it is an absolutely damning report. Senator Richardson, when he was Minister for Social Security, stood in this place over and over again and told us that the Department of Social Security was trim, taut and terrific and that there were no savings to be made. When we said there were savings to be made, he accused us of wanting to cut services and benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see in this report today something in the vicinity, conservatively, of about $30 million to $80 million that could be saved by improvements in administration and best practice within the Department of Social Security. The Audit Office tells us that if the Department of Social Security just looked at best practice within their own regional offices&mdash;not the best of the regional offices, but the top quarter&mdash;and applied those practices in the worst offices, you would get savings. If you actually introduced best practice from outside, you may get even greater savings. Enormous savings are to be made just by analysing the best practice undertaken within regional offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see in the Auditor-General's report information that there are three different systems for processing benefits: family benefits, pensions and unemployment benefits. So if you get in the wrong queue and you give all the information, they say, `You are in the wrong queue, go to the next queue', and you have to give all the information again. What does that do to staff time on the other side?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think an estimate has been made that if one minute per staff member per day was saved on bad practice, it would be worth $1 million a year&mdash;one minute per day! I am not saying that the Department of Social Security staff do not work hard enough but if they worked one minute per day smarter, because they were trained a different way or the processes were redone, there would be savings&mdash;and you would get better client services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the way through this report you see the Audit Office saying not only would there be savings but there would be improvements of an order of magnitude in client services for the number of people who go in there and wait in queues, or as someone I was associated with who was applying for a benefit was told, `Come back on another day because the person who deals with that is not here.' It did not matter that the person had driven 40 kilometres to get to the Department of Social Security office&mdash;`Come back on another day.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why was there not someone there? Because there are three different systems and regional officers are trained, apparently, in only one system. So somebody deals with pensions, somebody deals with another issue and because the information technology is not adequate, up-to-date and coping with the developments in social security, staff cannot be trained or are not trained to deal with cross-benefits. When I said that the client had driven 40 kilometres to apply for a benefit, they did find somebody to deal with that client and I give credit to that regional office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But through this Auditor-General's report time and time again we see examples of savings. The Auditor-General's Office considers that there is a five per cent to 10 per cent salary saving in benefit processing times. Senator Baume just mentioned that there was $560 million of salaries. I stand to be corrected&mdash;as I said, I have only just got this report&mdash;but it is estimated that 30 per cent of salaries is spent on processing and there is an estimated five per cent to 10 per cent saving there if there is an improvement in the time spent on processing claims. That is about $5 million. All the way through this you see $5 million here, another $1 million there and $35 million here. And I wonder&mdash;there are lots of things&mdash;what all this money could be used for that is actually wasted in inefficient processes, inefficient and outdated information technology and inefficient means of processing benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that the Audit Office has highlighted is that it is unable to determine overall workloads in regional offices because the necessary information was not available and could not be extracted from the Department of Social Security. Had the information been available, some comparisons could have been made. There could have been further savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report looks at work practices and IT across regional offices. If we translated that back to the area offices, I presume there would be savings&mdash;but perhaps not of the same magnitude. Not long ago former Senator Richardson came into this chamber and said, `There are no more savings to be made. You people want to rip the heart out of social security in Australia. That is what you want to do, you heartless people.' This government has had 13 years to get it right. If this government had been more businesslike in its approach and had paid attention to what it is doing rather than spending its time focusing on the opposition, millions of dollars would have been saved in an area like social security. These savings could have either repaid some of our foreign debt or been used to provide other services. But no, we have these inefficiencies from a tired Labor government which is unable to drag itself out of its complacency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that we no longer receive press releases from the Audit Office. I suppose the news is so bad so often that the government tries to hide it. The press gallery is not going to receive a press release. Some keen journalist has to go through the red and find that the Auditor-General's report has been tabled. The press will be interested in this one. We see that millions and millions of dollars can be saved. The government cannot come and say to us that because there are savings to be made the money will have to be taken out of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government needs to have worked smarter and to have been more efficient. No wonder the Australian people are looking to an alternative government. No wonder the Australian people are fed up. We see report after report like this. We see money being lost on ANL and money being lost on Midford-Paramount. Month after month we see areas identified where there could be savings. The amounts involved are not puny. We see $5 million going on a contract to promote changes in the disability reform package to a company that was balance sheet insolvent. Every time we turn around we see another example of this government's inefficiency and tired old approach to management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look across to the other side of this chamber I think I know why. Those opposite have never managed anything. When they do try to manage something&mdash;like Stephen Loosley, who has run away&mdash;they make a failure of it. They owe millions. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This area of support for veterans' health card holders and eligible pensioners is an important one because there is no doubt that hearing disabilities are now a very significant problem for a very large number of Australians. For example, this report reveals that approximately 140,000 hearing aids were fitted during the latest year for which figures are available. That was an increase of something like 61 per cent over the previous year. These figures relate simply to the government supported program. Many other people in Australia have received hearing aids through the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that this Audit Office report demonstrates that the cost of Australian Hearing Services rehabilitation services totals $599 for monaural and $834 for binaural assessment, fitting rehabilitation hearing aids, batteries and maintenance. Under the terms of the external services contracting agreement with the private sector, accredited private contractors are paid $915 as against the $595 internally and $1,415 as against $834 internally for similar services. There is no doubt that this service provides a significant benefit to veterans' health card holders and eligible pensioners who need this service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General points out, however, that the change in hearing service eligibility rules since April 1983 has brought about a very significant increase in the number of new client programs. There has been an increase of 40 per cent to a figure of 86,900 in the year to June 1994. The number of return client programs increased by 15 per cent to 96,000. Return clients are those who have previously been fitted with hearing devices by AHS and who return for further services. This has meant that programs commenced have increased by 26 per cent to 182,900, and a further 119,223 programs were commenced during the period from 1 July 1994 to 31 May this year. AHS provided something like 92,000 in the latest year and private contractors fitted 32,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result is that taxpayers are facing a much higher bill. That is one of the reasons why it is so vital that the Auditor-General has adequate resources to undertake this kind of inquiry. The amount of money is very significant. There is no suggestion that it has been wasted. There is no suggestion that it has been inappropriately spent. But it is right and proper that there should be thorough investigation of this kind of expenditure because parliamentary appropriations have increased from $59.9 million in 1992-93 to $91.4 million in 1993-94, with the bulk of the increase being absorbed in payments to contractors. Those payments increased to $36.3 million during the period. The total appropriation for the current year has been retained at $91.4 million. I presume that would be because there would not be the same sort of sudden growth that occurred when the number of eligible pensioners was significantly increased to include many people who are part-pensioners. I commend the report to the Senate and I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having regard to the Eleventh Report of the Select Committee on Superannuation, whether witnesses who gave evidence to the select committee were subject to any penalty or injury in respect of their evidence, and whether any contempt was committed in relation to those witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA>The report referred to in the terms of reference drew attention to two complaints. The first, by Mr Kevin Lindeberg, alleged that he and his wife had been subject to discriminatory behaviour by the Queensland Professional Credit Union Board as a result of his giving evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation in Brisbane on 29 April 1993 in relation to its inquiry into the operations of the Queensland Professional Officers Association Superannuation Fund. Similarly, the superannuation committee reported that Mr Des O'Neill had written to it alleging that the QPCU had refused to accept his application for membership as a direct consequence of his giving evidence at the same hearing of the superannuation committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question before the Committee of Privileges represented one element of matters which have been raised by Mr Lindeberg and Mr O'Neill in respect of the Queensland Professional Officers Association and the Queensland Professional Credit Union. Several of the matters have been canvassed before both the superannuation committee and the two select committees on public interest whistleblowing. The duty of this committee&mdash;that is, the Senate Standing Committee on Privileges&mdash;was solely to determine whether the refusal and termination of membership was on account of the appearance by Mr Lindeberg and Mr O'Neill before the superannuation committee of this Senate. For reasons explained in our report, the committee has not so concluded, and has therefore determined not to make a finding that contempt of the Senate has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read two paragraphs which are our conclusion immediately preceding that finding:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.15<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee of Privileges has concluded that the refusal of membership of the QPCU to Mr O'Neill was a preventive measure to ensure that the notices of motion which he had submitted on behalf of himself and Mr Lindeberg were ineffectual, and that he would be unable to attend the annual general meeting of 28 October 1993 to give support to Mr Lindeberg. It has further concluded that the reprisal against Mr Lindeberg, of terminating his membership of the QPCU and that of his wife, was taken, not because Mr Lindeberg had given evidence before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, but because he wished to ensure that the matters he had raised in evidence, which by the time of the meeting had been canvassed in the Eighth Report of that Committee, were given a public airing at a meeting of affected persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.16<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the QPCU's offer to consider restoring membership is concerned, given the perception by both Mr Lindeberg and Mr O'Neill that their reputations have been harmed by the arbitrary actions of the QPCU executive, the Committee considers that such a restoration of such a membership to Mr and Mrs Lindeberg and Mr O'Neill may right a wrong and accordingly would be proper.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This year marks the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. A very successful program of commemorative events has taken place as Australia Remembers. This program has touched the hearts of Australians of all ages, but the remembrance has been a special one for the veteran community and for those with close links with that community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The veterans' affairs 1995 budget package reflects the government's response to the changing needs of the veteran community through the introduction of a range of simplified and expanded services. This bill contains amendments necessary to implement some of the budget elements. Further bills, covering the remaining budget initiatives requiring legislative amendments, will be introduced shortly. Other measures do not require legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before I turn to the matters contained in this bill, Mr President, I would like to mention some of the non-legislative budget measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June this year, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs announced an aged care policy for the veteran community, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">As time goes by: continuing the commitment</EMPHASIS>. This policy sets out the future directions for care of the veteran community for the next five to ten years. The policy also includes the outcomes of the joint ministerial task force on veterans aged care services that the minister established, in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Human Services and Health, last year to improve veterans access to aged care services. In response to the recommendations of this task force, the government is introducing a five-year program to assist ex-service organisations, where necessary, to upgrade, replace or relocate their aged care facilities. This program will be complemented by a four-year community care seeding grants program to improve the range and availability of community services in areas of demonstrated need where there is a high veteran population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another major initiative increases funding for research targeted to the health needs of the veteran community. A number of priority research areas will be identified each year to maintain the focus on veteran-related issues. These arrangements will ensure that the health areas of most concern to veterans can be researched by the best scientists available in each field.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, to mark this year of remembrance, the government has extended air travel entitlement to Australia's three surviving Victoria Cross medal recipients for the remainder of their lives. The government is also contributing to special commemorative projects, such as the joint Australia-Thailand project for a memorial park centred on Hellfire Pass and nearby features of the railway that was constructed by allied POW labour during World War II, and the project to erect a memorial on Anzac Parade in Canberra to commemorate those who lost their lives in the Korean War.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other measures announced by the government include payment of nursing home costs for Australian former prisoners of war, access to chiropractic and osteopathic services by entitled veterans, war widows and war widowers. The delivery of health care has been simplified by reducing, from four to two, the different types of treatment entitlement cards which increases the entitlement of 140,000 veterans, war widows and war widowers to services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I now wish to refer to the features of this bill. The bill makes a number of reforms to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. These reforms will allow increased responsiveness to the range of housing options now available to veterans and eligible dependants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will extend eligibility for defence service home loans to cover several different title arrangements. Assistance will be available for properties held as tenants-in-common, on a company title, or on a leasehold title. The inclusion of these property titles reflects current commercial practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to advise that this bill will extend eligibility for a defence service home loan to full-time members of World War II women's services. For fifty years, former members of the World War II women's services who did not actually serve overseas during war time have been excluded from defence service homes benefits, unlike many of the male service volunteers. In taking the initiative to redress that situation,  the government recognises the major contribution to the war effort made by thousands of female volunteers who joined the services on the same basis as their male counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many veterans and others eligible for a defence service home loan find their housing needs change as they grow older. Retirement village or granny flat accommodation becomes the preferred arrangement for many who have difficulty living independently. The bill will increase flexibility in the use of the housing loan by allowing eligible persons to assign their loan entitlement to secure entry to a retirement village managed by an organisation which has, as its prime purpose, the provision of accommodation to veterans and veterans' widows. Assignment of the loan to provide a granny flat will also be available, provided that type of accommodation is appropriate to the needs of the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a move that will be particularly welcomed by the many individuals who have sought the change, the bill will extend the option to insure under the Defence Service Homes Insurance Scheme to all persons eligible under the Defence Service Homes Act, irrespective of whether they have received a defence service home loan on their home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes other changes to the Defence service home loan arrangements to increase its flexibility, such as allowing portability of a loan with the interest rates and remaining term of the current loan, and introducing generic certificates of entitlement. The bill also provides for cancellation of payment of the loan subsidy after the death of both the eligible veteran and any surviving spouse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I now want to outline the changes the bill makes to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The bill clarifies aspects of pension eligibility provisions in relation to allotment for duty and service in an operational area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators, the legislation has been improved so that it leads a reader through the relevant provisions, and develops a clearer understanding of the relationship between those provisions. Before the Veterans' Entitlements Act commenced in 1986, the Repatriation Act 1920 set out the service requirements for both a service pension and a disability pension. This bill preserves the original intention and concepts from the Repatriation Act, that qualifying service for a service pension arose from incurring danger from hostile forces of the enemy in a theatre of war.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since World War II, qualifying service has required service in the operational area to which the veteran was allotted. The bill also confirms this as the requirement for operational service that attracts the beneficial standard of proof for disability pension claims. The bill makes it clear that members of units allotted for duty in Korea, but who served only in Japan, have operational service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also enable any excess payment of Social Security pensions and benefits received by a veteran's partner, that result from a retrospective grant or increase of disability pension, to be deducted from the lump sum arrears of disability pension. These new arrangements will result in a speedier payment of the balance of disability pension arrears.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the bill makes a number of changes to eligibility for a partner service pension. Firstly, from 1 October 1995 a partner service pension will not be granted unless the partner is 50 years or older, or is caring for a dependent child, or is the partner of a veteran who receives the special rate of disability pension for total and permanent incapacity or for total blindness. Existing partner service pensioners will not be affected. This change is consistent with the government's Working Nation policy which highlights the need to encourage work force participation. Of course, those partners who are ineligible for a partner service pension will be able to test eligibility for another income support payment, such as a carer service pension, or from Social Security a partner allowance, disability support pension or other payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the bill will enable those who qualify for a partner service pension to retain eligibility for that pension, even if the veteran loses payability of the age or invalidity service pension. Thirdly, a person, including a widow or a widower, will be eligible for a partner service pension if the person qualifies for an age pension and if their partner is, or was, a veteran with qualifying service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also limits the rate of service pension payable to a person who is a member of a couple to the partnered rate of pension, even though the other member of the couple may not be receiving a pension or benefit. Those partnered pensioners who are now receiving a higher rate of pension will not have their pension reduced as a result of this change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the bill makes a number of changes to the income support supplement. The government introduced the income support supplement from March this year. The purpose of this supplement is to allow war widows and widowers to receive their compensation and income support payment from one department, the Department of Veterans' Affairs. One of the changes will better target persons who could benefit from this single payment arrangement, by extending eligibility for the income support supplement to war widows and widowers who are partners of service or social security pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another change will be the exclusion of war widow or widower's pension when calculating bereavement payments to surviving partners of income support supplement recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, last year the government initiated major extensions of treatment and support services for veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder around Australia. Many veterans have directly benefited from specialised in-patient services and many more have received counselling and support services from the Vietnam Veterans' Counselling Service. This bill now introduces automatic eligibility for post-traumatic stress disorder treatment. Early intervention in post-traumatic stress disorder cases greatly increases the likelihood of successful treatment outcomes. Younger veterans and other veterans of all ages and all conflicts, being now assured of access to treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, will be encouraged to seek appropriate early treatment for psychiatric problems brought on by post-traumatic stress disorder.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another reform being introduced in this bill will simplify access to services by some people. The Department of Veterans' Affairs will be able to issue a Seniors Health Card to certain widows and widowers and to non-illness separated spouses of veterans.  This is not an extension of eligibility for the Seniors Health Card, as these people are otherwise eligible for a card from the Department of Social Security, but the changes will be of considerable convenience to those who may periodically lose and gain payability of a pension from the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In concluding, Mr President, I believe that this bill presents important measures that respond to the changing needs of the veteran community. I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the following matter be referred to the Employment, Education and Training References Committee for inquiry and report on or before 23 November 1995:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether the sale of Bond University, as one of a very small number of non-Government universities in Australia, to the University of Queensland, a public institution, would be in the national interest and, in particular, whether it would lead to a reduction in diversity and choice in Australian tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA>This is really quite an important matter in so far as Australian higher education is concerned at the moment. It relates to the purchase or, it would seem, likely purchase by the University of Queensland of the Bond University property on the Gold Coast, with the hope that the University of Queensland would then be able to take over the Bond University as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would be well aware, there are very few non-government higher education institutions in Australia and, in a way, Bond is unique among the very few that do exist. It is a full fee-paying institution offering undergraduate degrees to Australian students, and provides an alternative to the government system which dominates the sector. It does not mean that either is necessarily better than the other, but it does offer some choice that otherwise would not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, in its relatively short time of existence, Bond has built a community of past students and supporters who speak highly of the education product that it has delivered, and are very committed to the continuation of Bond as a separate and non-government institution. As you are also well aware, the property is controlled by Japanese banks as a result of collapses post the corporate excesses of the 1980s. They are wishing to recover some of the moneys that are owing, and they obviously have an interest in selling their asset to the highest bidder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the bidders clearly was the University of Queensland, and they were successful. Whether they were the highest bidder I gather is the subject of some debate, but in any event it seems that they were higher than the group that represented Bond University as such. The situation now exists that Bond University remains under its control and as constituted in the Queensland legislation, but the property has been purchased by a public university which intends to take it over. It says that it intends to take it over as a private, fee paying alternative rather than totally subsume it within the public system. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just be patient. We have expressed concerns about this issue. We have expressed concerns about the loss of diversity and choice by one of the very few non-government institutions being absorbed by a public institution. That is pretty clear cut. We have said that before. There is no secret in that. Because of that loss of diversity and choice, a whole lot of other issues arise. For example, who is funding the Queensland university in this purchase? What guarantees are there that it will remain as a private institution? Will there be further cost to the public in the purchase? They are all issues that I think are vitally important to the public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make a start in trying to find the answers to some of these questions the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee, under the able leadership of Senator Tierney, has been conducting an internal inquiry, a private inquiry. That is no doubt useful to the committee members, but it does not help the balance of the parliament or the public at large to become aware of the consequences of this particular move and, in particular, whether this proposed move by the Queensland university is in the national interest. It has therefore been my view that the private inquiry that the committee has been undertaking should be a public inquiry, that it should report to this Senate and that we should encourage public debate on an issue which, on the face of it, will have very serious consequences within the higher education sector in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an effort to better inform the parliament and the public, I have moved this motion and trust that the Senate will give it support. It is set within a very tight time frame. The committee would have to report by 23 November, which would give us a week of sittings within which to debate any conclusions of the committee and thus reach a parliamentary position. That position should therefore be on the public record before the time for completion of the sale of the Bond University to the Queensland university. That information will no doubt also be helpful to the Queensland government&mdash;the Labor government that has just been re-elected&mdash;which also has to have a point of view. Senator Schacht, you might also tell us the attitude of your colleagues in Queensland, because the chances are that they will have to pass legislation within Queensland. You may have to pass legislation federally as a result of this purchase, and no doubt you were briefed on that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are important issues. The debate should be on the public agenda and debated within the public. The parliament can help in that regard in this instance, and I therefore urge the Senate to adopt this reference and request the relevant committee to conduct the inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The University of Queensland was announced by KPMG as the preferred tenderer for the purchase of Bond University campus on Friday, 13 October 1995. The University of Queensland bid was accepted ahead of five other final tenderers. The reported sale price was $100 million. The purchase is subject to approval of the state government. It is also conditional on the University of Queensland being able to establish satisfactory access to finance and to gain control of Bond University Ltd, the company which operates Bond University. The University of Queensland has 60 days in which to finalise loan negotiations for the purchase and seek approval from the state Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the business Bond University is not part of the sale.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been reported in the media that the Bond University council will fight the attempt to take control of BUL through the courts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was just seeking clarification. I am just trying to help you all the way along here, Senator Hill. The Higher Education Funding Act 1988 presents no legislative impediment to a public university purchasing and operating Bond University. The public universities are autonomous institutions with access to substantial income from sources other than the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has therefore taken the view that it would be undesirable to intervene in what would be a commercial decision of a university. Furthermore, the act provides the Minister for Employment, Education and Training with no powers to prevent a public university from purchasing Bond University. Such a purchase would represent a commercial decision by a public university similar to the purchase of any other property or asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Institutions are prevented under the act from charging fees for undergraduate courses. However, an institution owning Bond University as a commercial venture would not be in breach of the act if Bond maintained a legally separate identity. The minister has made it quite clear on a number of occasions that the government would not provide any assistance for, or guarantee any loans associated with, the purchase. This position has been conveyed to interested public universities through ministerial correspondence and discussions between the Department of Employment, Education and Training and institutions at senior officer level. The Commonwealth has also made it clear that the acquisition of the Bond University operations should not lead to any diminution of the quality and range of public university higher education provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the University of Queensland, I am advised that as recently as last Friday at the annual educational profiles meeting the Vice-Chancellor gave a complete and unequivocal assurance that the purchase and operation of the Bond campus would not involve any use of public funds and that its operation would effectively be quarantined from that of the University of Queensland as a public university. Assurances were also given at that meeting that there would be no diminution of the range and quality of courses that would be offered to students attending the University of Queensland. The Commonwealth would monitor the situation through the annual educational profiles process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event that the purchase by the University of Queensland finally proceeds, the Department of Employment, Education and Training will initiate detailed discussions with the university to ensure that an effective and demonstrable barrier is built between the public and private operation of the university. This is likely to involve the annual provision of separate and independently audited statements for both its public and private operations and a requirement that there be no use of Commonwealth operating grant, research or capital funds. Apart from these specific measures, which will be developed in conjunction with the University of Queensland, the department will continue to monitor the publicly funded activities of the universities through its normal processes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regard this as a very important reference for Senate inquiry. I declare two personal interests in this matter. One is that I am a graduate of a public university, the University of Adelaide, and I am close to the three public universities in my own city: the University of South Australia, Flinders University and the University of Adelaide. I have for 17 years in the Senate been involved with university policy matters and have strong views about making sure that our public universities prosper and serve the Australian public in the best possible way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second personal interest I have is that our first son is a student at Bond University, he having openly won a nationally available scholarship. He has nearly completed a law degree at the university. His attendance there has given me the opportunity to hear a great deal about Bond. I visited there on several occasions before he became a student and have been, I would say, a strong supporter of this addition of a private university to the spectrum of offerings for undergraduate degrees in this country. I am an even greater supporter given the personal knowledge I have through meeting with many Bond students and some members of staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement just made by the government minister is very interesting. This day, 17 October, represents the first time that we have heard anything at all from this government as to its policy or as an indication of the questions that need to be determined as policy in the matter of a public university possibly buying a private university. This government has not made any public statement on this matter, even though this was an area of crucial concern to Bond University over the last several months and it has been quite public that there were three public universities&mdash;the University of Queensland, Monash University and Griffith University&mdash;making bids to possibly purchase this private university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have heard is an admission by the government that there have been ministerial correspondence and discussions at a senior bureaucratic level. That is not good enough for a matter as important as this. There needs to be public consultation about what will be the best way to preserve the assets we already have in higher education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the repercussions for this private university and any other private university, and what are the repercussions for public universities, especially for students and staff in those universities, from any of the solutions that might come forward to the question that Senator Schacht has flagged on behalf of the minister?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the decision announced by the receivers on Friday to declare the University of Queensland as a possible purchaser of Bond University, subject to three conditions, we have heard from the minister just now that there is a fourth condition. Let us get it clear. Last Friday it was announced by receivers that the University of Queensland would be the possible purchaser of Bond University. But that is subject to three declared conditions. The first is state government approval&mdash;it may get it or it may not. The second is satisfactory finance being available. That may be possible or not. It is crucial to the appropriateness of public money ever being used in this matter that that condition be very carefully met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third condition is that there be successful negotiations with Bond University Ltd. I understand very well that Bond University Ltd has made resolute decisions that they will not see any diminution in the standards of the courses that are established, the undertakings they have given students to complete degrees and the undertakings given to staff; and the objectives, the vision, the whole raison d'etre of Bond University will not be compromised by the new ownership arrangements. Bond University Ltd clearly will take those concerns to the negotiations with the potential purchaser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to strengthen Bond University Ltd's arm in ensuring all those good objectives. The fourth condition that the minister has flagged just now is that the minister, in private correspondence and at a senior bureaucratic level&mdash;not public&mdash;has said that the arrangements for the new owner's relationship with Bond University Ltd must be such that there is not a use of public funds for private purposes. How could that ever be guaranteed? I put that to the Senate because whenever any public university borrows, let us say, $100 million to purchase a private university or any private activity, it gives some guarantee to the creditor&mdash;the bank or other agency from which it is borrowing the money&mdash;that in default of the loan there will be something that is claimable, to meet the advanced credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know from all sorts of public institutions, including Aboriginal communities, that this is an enormously difficult matter to guarantee. One of the sadnesses we observe in the case of Aboriginal communities is that where land is vested in that community forever, it is not negotiable&mdash;a mortgage cannot be put on it. It is not subject to being advanced to fulfil any borrowings if they get into trouble. Therefore, a bank cannot give loans to many Aboriginal communities because they have not got a negotiable asset to forgo in the event of any difficulty arising in the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Queensland university, how can there be any guarantee of a loan, even if $100 million is borrowed to buy a private undertaking, unless there is a negotiable asset presently owned by the University of Queensland that would be forgone if there were any difficulty in purchasing that private university or any other private entity? The University of Queensland could have said that it would buy an industrial factory worth $50 million and work as the owner of that factory for the benefit of its engineering and research students. It would have an applied arm that would be directly owned by the university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it went into that sort of undertaking, it would not only need to meet its own tests for the viability of the project&mdash;that it was a profitable undertaking&mdash;but also satisfy itself as to how it would pay for the loan if anything went wrong with that commercial undertaking. I bring that to light. In the minister's words, there is this fourth condition on the proposed purchase of Bond University by the University of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer to two other matters. The implications for all public universities are vast. If Queensland university does go ahead with this, I concede that it is possible that a Senate inquiry, with public consultation, could be satisfied that this was in the national interest and was not going to diminish diversity and choice for Australian students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider the worst outcome. Let us say that this somehow or other goes ahead because the four conditions are met. Other public universities are likely to do the same thing. I predict that Monash University, Griffith University  and all manner of public universities will say that it is in their interests to set up buildings on land that they will now buy to have the XYZ private university associated and owned by them. They will present courses for certain fees as a private operation integrated with their public offerings in the main university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The repercussions of that may well be of great concern to students with regard to the fee structure and any loss of public courses to that private university adjunct of the public university and so on. I want to be satisfied about this. I believe that the staff associations of our universities need to be satisfied about it, as do the students.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not shutting any door on a proposal that is in the national interest or that meets the scrutiny of all the questions that we are now raising in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major concern is our private universities. I want to make sure that we protect the integrity and the best interests of our private universities. Let us face it: the present government has done very little to assist either of the two private universities that currently exist. A couple of others are being planned. In the days of former Minister Dawkins, in particular, doors were shut and every barrier was put in the way. The existing private universities in Australia have managed to get over those barriers and prosper nevertheless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's placing difficulties in the path of private universities has moderated in recent times. In the Senate, there has always been a lively debate that has included Senator Bell and his colleagues, Senator Tierney, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Training, you, Mr Acting Deputy President Senator Colston, as a former chairman of this committee and me as a former chairman of that committee. We have had a longstanding debate about higher education policy in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is so important that it must no longer be subject to some ministerial correspondence and discussions by senior bureaucrats. It needs to be subject to public consultation and the most careful scrutiny and debate through the Senate committee and then here in the chamber. We will then hold not only this government in its last months but a future government&mdash;my colleagues will be in government very soon&mdash;to a well-formed set of guidelines for public policy with regard to public universities and private universities and the relationship between the two of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not shut the door to any outcome. I am not prejudiced as to the results of this inquiry. As a member of that Senate standing committee and a long-serving senator with an interest in higher education policy, I implore the Senate to unanimously support this reference. We should get on with it and make a contribution to policy debate in this matter. </PARA>

It is important in practical terms that the Senate understand the workload of this committee. I will then go to the substance of why this inquiry ought not be held in the manner that has been suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year, this committee has already reported on open learning, accountability in Commonwealth-state funding relations and Austudy. It currently has four inquiries running: long-term unemployment, the Australian National Training Authority, education and correction facilities, and early childhood education. It is required to report within the next month on two of those inquiries. One was deferred today; there were three. You are proposing that by the 23rd of next month this inquiry report as well. That is ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secretariat of this committee, in my judgment, is highly professional and grossly overworked. There is already an extraordinary and ridiculous strain on resources. This was pointed out when the Liberals on this committee rammed through early in the year this range of inquiries. They were seeking to use the new Senate inquiry process to provide a platform for their own miserable political efforts in marginal seats, which has been demonstrated throughout this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, the proposal to establish an inquiry into Bond University flies in the face of good sense. The committee already has existing commitments and simply does not have the time or the resources to do this investigation justice. This committee, is required to look at these issues thoroughly and seriously. We have a strong tradition of public sector provision in this country. In higher education, that ought be preserved; that is my very strong personal belief. But the sale of Bond University and its land and buildings is not an immediate threat to that tradition. Bond University will continue to function as a private university. It would appear that it is merely changing landlords. That status quo should be maintained. Diversity in higher education is not being reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It strikes me that there are important implications, as I have said, but they require a much deeper and broader inquiry than what is being proposed by this grubby little effort. In terms of trying to pressure the committee to undertake this work, it is like squeezing blood out of a stone. It is a flagrant abuse of the committee system which will discredit the whole Senate, because this is the pattern that is emerging on this committee, as Senator Teague understands only too well. </PARA>

<PARA>This advance to the Minister for Finance relates to the months of June and July. As I note, this is now October. I understand this was first listed in our last sitting fortnight but we did not get to it. The point is that some of these applications for top up funding, as they are, were made many months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am intrigued to know why it has taken so long for these requests for advances to the Minister for Finance to be tabled here in this chamber. For example, from the Department of Finance, there is a request for $2,752,579 relating to bank fees and interest charges in respect of the Commonwealth's bank accounts held at banks in Australia and overseas. This request came from the resource policies and management branch of Finance in March 1995. It is now October. Why on earth is this being presented to the parliament at this late stage? We met in August this year to deal with the budget. In the absence of a sound explanation, I find it extraordinary that this kind of request comes to us so late. The department owes the Senate an explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the only longstanding matter which concerns me. For example, the Department of Industry, Science and Technology had a request for additional funding of $200,000-odd in order to pay a negotiated settlement, which is a final charge. I understand this relates to a long time ago. In fact, it relates to two claims against the Australian Customs Service relating to compensation to a company called Blooms and another called ALSCO arising out of a decision made by the then Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce in May 1984 to impose dumping duties on overalls exported from China. The claimants seek compensation for the duties paid under that decision together with interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was in fact a negotiated settlement. The funds have previously been provided through the advance to the Minister for Finance in February this year. At that time, it was expected the entire settlement package of $1.5 million would be paid out of the compensation and legal expenses item in their allocations. Due to factors beyond the control of the Australian Customs Service this settlement has been delayed from the previously specified date of 3 February 1995 to 3 July 1995. In the interim, additional payments of $684,585 have been incurred resulting in the need for some additional funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know the merits of this case. All I do know is that this was supposed to have been settled on 3 July 1995. By the way, it does appear on the face of it that the Australian Customs Service was wrong again. I do not think anyone in this chamber has forgotten the consequences of one extraordinarily badly handled matter in the Australian Customs Service relating to Midford. This amount should have been paid by 3 July and here we are in October having the matter brought to our attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another matter which is clearly very late. This relates to another half a million dollars being requested by the Department of Administrative Services relating to visits abroad by ministers&mdash;that is for the year ended 30 June this year. Already, $4.47 million has been spent. They need another $417,000 to lift the total to just under $5 million. Whether these trips are worth while or not, I do not know. All I do know is that it is quite wrong that accounts payable by 30 June 1995 should only be coming to our attention at this stage. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Over time, certainly in the last few years, small business has demonstrated its capacity and its importance to employment in this country. It has continued to show very strong growth. Indeed, from 1985-86 to 1993-94 there was an increase of almost 860,000 jobs in the small business area. This resulted in the shared total employment accounted for by small business rising from 39 per cent to an estimated 45 per cent. That is a very important aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report demonstrates further the government's commitment to small business. Some of the initiatives of this government are outlined in this report. In relation to the Ausindustry programs, the report states:</PARA>

<PARA>The one stop shop type approach has become very important. It states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of AusIndustry support, by the end of the decade some 15,000 additional companies will become active internationally, either through exporting, developing import replacements or supplying firms involved in international trade.</PARA>
<PARA>I think a very important aspect of that is the involvement of small business, particularly in the service area. I have some figures that quite clearly indicate that growth in the service industry area from an export point of view has been quite substantial and very important. </PARA>

I can only hope that the government's level of support for small business equals its enthusiasm for producing a very expensive and glossy document. I guess that most small businesses would hope that they are as successful in making money as the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, and the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, are in getting their pretty pictures in full colour throughout this document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Murphy outlined briefly the importance of small business. Small business provides a bigger proportion of total private sector employment than big business does. That is the figure that Senator Murphy was referring to. Something like 50 per cent of private sector employment is in small businesses. Small businesses make up 96.9 per cent of all business operations in the private non-agricultural sector. A couple of years ago something like 780,000 non-agricultural private sector businesses were operating in Australia, 756,000 of which were small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are certainly concerned whether small business is getting a fair crack of the whip. On page 76 of the report it is revealed that the gross operating surpluses of unincorporated trading enterprises contained in the national accounts in the 12 months to March 1995 were 2.8 per cent higher than the corresponding period in the previous year. This fell by one per cent in the March quarter of 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, the gross operating surplus of larger businesses, identified by corporate enterprises, grew more than twice as fast&mdash;that is, 6.9 per cent in the 12 months to March 1995. Consequently, the share of private business gross operating surplus&mdash;that is, excluding the gross operating surpluses of public and financial enterprises&mdash;accounted for by unincorporated enterprises has fallen from an average share of 41.7 per cent in the 12 months to March 1994 to 41 per cent in the corresponding period to March 1995. In other words, while big businesses are doing better small businesses are not getting their share of the benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I admit that you have to go to page 76 to find that out, but it is evident that this government has very little concern for small business. We have seen with the Austudy regulations that are presently before this chamber that the government discriminates against small businesses in an attempt&mdash;I have to say a proper attempt&mdash;to stop rorting of the Austudy system. They have concentrated their file on small business people. I think that reflects quite clearly this government's lack of concern, interest and support for small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from anything else, the way this government has sneakily increased sale tax, which small business has to collect, is quite extraordinary. There has been a 50 per cent increase in total sales tax collections since the last election as result of these sneaky increases in the sales tax rate. This is terribly complicated for small business. A study has shown that there is something like a 25 per cent collection cost for small business associated with these complicated sales tax arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see from the general compliance costs this government has directed at small business that small business carries an immense burden. That burden has been imposed by this government and involves costs of compliance and meeting such things as the sales tax requirements. It is no surprise that small business is not doing as well as big business in the so-called economic recovery. The economic recovery has helped big business, but it has done very little, on the face of it, for small business. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a matter which I believe has not received sufficient attention by either this chamber or the other place. Yet it is a matter of immediate and mounting public concern. It is the poor public standing of federal members of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most members will have seen the excellent article by Kerry Anne Walsh and Nick Richardson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 12 September and a follow up article by Nick Richardson of 26 September which dealt with public attitudes towards politicians. If you were like me, you would have been somewhat disheartened by the articles and the results of the accompanying Morgan opinion poll. The poll found, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">84 per cent of people believe Federal MPs lie at election time to win votes;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">only 24 per cent believe Federal MPs usually tell the truth;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">79 per cent believe that Federal MPs can't be trusted to keep election promises; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">91 per cent believe that Federal MPs twist the truth to suit their own arguments.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only that, but 56 per cent of voters said they had lost faith in the political system. And that is the real concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal with those findings if I may. While most of those statements are aimed at federal MPs generally, it is safe to assume that the 79 per cent who believe federal MPs can't be trusted to keep election promises are thinking exclusively about federal Labor MPs. After all, they have been the only group of federal MPs who have had the opportunity to break election promises over the past 13 years. And let's face it, they have turned the breaking of election promises into an art form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, all Australians will recall the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to provide Australians with income tax cuts. What happened to that? It was broken without so much as a beg your pardon. Politicians cannot continue to treat voters with the contempt that Mr Paul Keating and the Labor government have shown over the past 13 years and expect to be held in high regard themselves. Voters are saying enough is enough, and that is reflected in the Morgan poll results. It is reflected in the results I have already outlined and is reflected in other results as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, more electors, that is, 39 per cent, believe that federal MPs attach greater importance to their own interests than to those of their electorate, 36 per cent, or of their party, 22 per cent. Not only that, but 52 per cent of voters believe that the quality of federal politicians is worse than it was 20 years ago. Coincidentally, that corresponds with the period Mr Keating has been a member of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More specifically, if we go back 20 years looking for a reason why community attitudes have declined, we can identify one possible cause: the appointment of Mr Keating as Minister for Northern Australia in 1975. It was only a short appointment because the government was swept from office later that year; but it must have had some impact on the public imagination, because public attitudes towards federal MPs have declined ever since that time. They have shown a greater rate of decline during the Hawke and Keating years than at any other time in recent history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the solution? There are a number. Firstly, a change of government and a replacement with a government which is seen to be honest and caring. Clearly, a Howard coalition government can offer that hope. Secondly, the adoption of a code of conduct. As senators are aware, there is currently a draft before both houses of parliament. While I think we are probably heading in the right direction with it, I believe it is one area in which we should act sooner rather than later. With different state parliaments having adopted or being in the process of adopting codes of conduct, and with many of the professions having adopted codes, I do not believe that we can afford to be tardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the public have traditionally expected MPs to adhere to higher than normal standards of probity. Unfortunately, recent events at a state and federal level have shown that some MPs are not maintaining the standards expected of us. I think it is fair to argue that the Easton affair and other similar inquiries are having a negative impact on public perceptions of members of parliament, both state and federal. My concern is that, while that continues to be the case, the public opinion polls will continue to rank us well down the ladder in terms of ethics and honesty and not up at the top where we should be, given public expectations of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is highlighted by the results of another Morgan poll, which was conducted last April, which showed that community attitudes towards federal members of parliament had fallen dramatically during the Hawke and Keating years. In 1983, 19 per cent of Australians rated federal MPs very high or high in terms of ethics and honesty. That in itself is something to be concerned about, because it suggests that 81 per cent either believed federal MPs to be unethical and dishonest, or they didn't have a view. My feeling is that it would be the former rather than the latter. By April of this year that figure had fallen to 9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only good news in the poll was the fact that we still rate marginally better than newspaper journalists, at 8 per cent. The bad news is that we rank 22 out of 24 of the occupations included in the survey; the third worst, behind newspaper reporters and car salesmen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that members, individually and collectively, decided to do some image improving. I think a change of government and the prompt adoption of a code of conduct would go some way towards achieving that goal. They would certainly help to restore public faith in politicians and the political institutions we manage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to draw the attention of the Senate to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 14-15 October. The article is entitled `Meridian holders' pensions cut'. I note that Senator Patterson spoke on this issue last night. I want to refer to that part of her speech in which she said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1992 budget, this Labor government put legislation through this house which established that unrealised capital gains on shares would be treated as income for the purposes of assessing the pension. We said&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the coalition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that we would review that when in government because it was not to come into effect until 1993. Unfortunately, we were not in government to do that.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Patterson went on to detail the sins of this government on the issue and claimed the only salvation for these seriously affected pensioners would be a coalition government. I guess we could say that Senator Patterson's claims entitle her to be called Salvation Kay. However, these claims need to be further examined. When Senator Patterson said that in 1992 this Labor government put legislation through this house, et cetera, she did not say that that legislation was passed with the support of the coalition&mdash;that is, the Liberal and National parties. Perhaps it is not Salvation Kay but Patterson's curse which is the real problem for these pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>. I would like to read some of this article to the Senate because I think it puts the situation very clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five years after the collapse of the Estate Mortgage group, nearly 50,000 investors are close to receiving their first income distribution, salvaged from the assets that became the listed Meridian Investment Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But just as unitholders dare to hope they might eventually recover their lost capital, the Department of Social Security has stepped in and reduced the pensions of about 8000 former Estate Mortgage investors.</PARA>
<PARA>Some have sold their units, under pressure because they are concerned that they are going to lose some of their pension or all of it but, in doing so, they have recovered only a third of the money they lost in 1990. It is not much of a choice for these people. Let me give the Senate a little more of the background of this issue. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meridian units&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which attempted to rescue the particular loss for these people&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">split into A and B class, floated on the Australian Stock Exchange in December 1993, primarily to provide some liquidity for investors who had to sell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both unit classes are trading around $1.07 a share but would need to rise to about $3.65 for investors to recover the money they lost in 1990&mdash;disregarding the effects of inflation, which would push the benchmark up further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the DSS, noting Meridian's share price has risen by about 50 per cent in the past year, has told pensioners their allowance will be reduced as a result of the share price increase.</PARA>
<PARA>We need to get this clear. Many pensioners lost most of their savings in the collapse of Estate Mortgage. They had been hoping over the past five years that, through transferring their investment in Estate Mortgage to the Meridian group, they would eventually be able to recover some of that loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Social Security, after noting that there has been a slight increase in the share price, now wants to assess that increase as income and thereby cut the pension of these people. In fact, these pensioners still have a substantial loss but through this particular peculiar interpretation their loss is being accounted for as income in some way or other. The Department of Social Security admits that there is a problem and is prepared eventually to do something about it. But the problem I have is that, in the meantime, these pensioners are losing part of their pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other choice is that they are being forced virtually to sell their investment at a very discounted rate. While they will retain the pension, they will also retain that substantial loss. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the DSS's stance is penalising former Estate Mortgage investors waiting to get their capital back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DSS treats such increases as income, even though no distributions have been made by the trust since 1990, and assumes the investment will record a similar performance over the coming year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Global estimates about 8000 unitholders have been affected by the DSS review, with pensions being cut by up to $40 a fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Unitholders are to a certain extent trapped in the trust because, if they sell their units, they will also be selling their rights to any recovery from the litigation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, the Department of Social Security is, to a certain extent, sympathetic. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A DSS spokeswoman was last week sympathetic but firm on the plight of Estate Mortgage investors who have lost part of their pension. She said while the matter was "under review", the investors' plight would be resolved this July next year, when a new assessment system for managed investments would be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the fact the pensioners face cuts in the meantime, the new system will not completely solve the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the trusts pay no income next year&mdash;and Meridian is making no promises on the dividends&mdash;investors will still be deemed to have received income of a certain level, probably around 6 per cent, and will have their entitlements reduced accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister could waive the deeming rate in Meridian's case, but this is apparently possible only if the trusts are frozen again, leaving Meridian investors who want to keep their pension damned if they sell and damned if they don't.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought Senator Woodley's contribution got off on a very bad note with his attack on Senator Patterson. I wish to put it on record that Senator Woodley's characterisation of Senator Patterson is wholly off the mark. Senator Patterson has been working very hard on this issue for a long period of time. I can recall at least two, maybe three, contributions that she has made in this chamber on this issue in the last two years. Before the last election&mdash;before Senator Woodley came to the Senate&mdash;Senator Patterson was assiduous in following this matter as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite extraordinary for Senator Woodley to come in here and say that Senator Patterson is to blame for this. Senator Patterson has been one of the most valiant defenders of people who have been caught by this government trap. It was a government trap that was introduced before the last election to take effect just after the last election. Senator Patterson has criticised the government over this matter time and time again and has sought to get some sort of relief for the pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, I believe the attack that was made on Senator Patterson is wholly unsatisfactory and totally and utterly unsubstantiated by fact. Moreover, I should also point out that some others of us have also been involved in trying to make representations to get the situation rectified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic problem is that, in addition to the government's lack of concern over the plight of these Estate Mortgage unitholders, the value of whose units has dropped dramatically because they were based on the previous face value of the units they held in Estate Mortgage Trust, not on the value of the restructured Meridian Investment Trust at the time at which it was floated. The unitholders have the further problem in that they have been caught because it is very difficult for them to sell the units. They have been kept on a tightrope waiting for the result of litigation which, in my opinion, may take 10 years to resolve. When you are talking about millions of documents being involved in the litigation, you cannot expect it to be solved overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had the unsatisfactory conduct of the previous manager of Meridian unit trusts who extracted large amounts of money from the unitholders by telling them that nobody would do the job cheaper and that he was the key to their salvation. Then, of course, he promptly resigned and a new manager came in and did the job for a million dollars a year less. So they have been dealt with very badly all round. But I do take exception to the attack that was made by Senator Woodley on Senator Patterson. It is wholly unfair and, as I said, entirely based on a failed perception of the facts in this case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But not surprising. I will not be equally facetious back about his name but, if he chose to find out how Paterson's curse is spelt, he would find that it is spelt with one `t'; so he was wrong on that count. At no time have I said that the coalition did not go along with the legislation when it went through in 1992. If we had not done that, this government would have turned around and said to us, `You're irresponsible. Every time we go to make a saving, you won't respond.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You talk about saving. We do not have the resources in opposition. We are unlike the Democrats who are irresponsible and who can say anything and promise anything because they know they will never have to live with the consequences. They will all come running down here bleating in a minute. They will be saying, `That is terrible, you shouldn't say it,' but it is true. We could not, with the resources that we have in opposition, estimate whether the government's information about savings was correct or not. We do not have an army of staff like the ministers do. Our shadow ministers manage with one&mdash;and some of them, at a pinch, two&mdash;extra staff member. It is like a David and Goliath exercise. We do not have those resources to assess that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we said that we would review that legislation in government. It was not to come into effect until September 1993, well after when the 1993 election would have been held. As it went, the election was held in March. I took that legislation through this Senate. I was concerned about it and I expressed concern on behalf of the coalition. As for Senator Woodley blaming me, my colleagues would take corporate responsibility for that because we made that decision as a party. So to accuse me personally, I also find insulting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never said that we did not support that legislation. We said, and I said at the time, that we would review it because we had concerns about it. We could not keep that promise because we did not win that election&mdash;even though 53 per cent of Australians chose to vote for us&mdash;because of the way the seats are distributed. I believed it was my responsibility to pursue that persistently until the government did something about it, because I had made the commitment on behalf of the coalition that we would review it. The only way we could do that from opposition was to pursue the government relentlessly, and we did that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can stand here with no shame and no embarrassment, but to have Senator Woodley ridicule me in the way he did this evening is totally unacceptable. I feel offended because it was untrue, because I did all I could on behalf of the coalition to pursue the government. We tried to amend social security legislation on a number of occasions. Each time a piece of social security legislation came through we moved an amendment to have that part of the legislation repealed. I also moved a private member's bill that passed this house and which was disregarded when it went to the House of Representatives. We took every single opportunity we were given to have that legislation repealed because the more time we had to look at it, the more we saw the implications of it and we had made that commitment to review it in government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the truth be known, they really would not support the Senate having a review. I think we would have had a better review than what happened. But anyway, that wasn't to be the case. The government had its own review, pointed at ageing agendas, came up with some recommendations and the legislation is to take effect in July 1996. I believe the reason that we have that change is because we in the opposition pushed it&mdash;it was not the Democrats. I did not see the Democrats down here making amendment after amendment and I did not see the Democrats really pushing that issue. Because we pushed it, pensioners will be better off in the long run. It has just taken a long time. It was a 1992 budget and we will not see it changed until July 1996. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to deal with a most extraordinary statement by Senator Cook today. He said at question time, `We will not be introducing it'&mdash;that is, a consumption tax. `We will not be introducing a consumption tax,' said Senator Cook. I wonder what he thinks the latest three budgets have been all about. There have been massive rises in consumption tax. The biggest consumption tax of all is the Keating sales tax&mdash;sales tax was originally introduced by a Labor government&mdash;that Mr Keating has increased by 50 per cent since he said there would be no consumption taxes in the 1993 election campaign. According to the latest budget, it has increased by 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the last election, sales tax collections for the year to 30 June 1992 were $9.3 billion and this year they are budgeted to be $14 billion&mdash;a 50 per cent increase. To keep it company, there is another lovely consumption tax that this government revels in&mdash;petrol tax. Petrol tax collections were $7.2 billion before the last election and in this year's budget they are to be $10.3 billion&mdash;a 43 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have Senator Cook saying, `Oh, we wouldn't introduce a consumption tax,' when his government's fastest rising taxes, particularly since they promised not to have consumption taxes in their last election campaign, are consumption taxes&mdash;sales tax and petrol tax in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are a few others too. When you add them all together, Mr Keating's consumption taxes total about $30.7 billion in the current budget&mdash;almost $8 billion or one-third more than the dreaded consumption tax that Mr Keating opposed at the last election. Far more than Dr Hewson's consumption tax is Mr Keating's consumption tax&mdash;up 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see what this means to the ordinary family. Let us compare this sneaky, hidden Keating sales tax with the more open, honest, evident one that Dr Hewson was recommending. The Keating government has raised the sales tax rates yet again in July of this year in a secret way so that the Keating sales tax now represents an average $60 a week for a four-person family. That is the highest level ever in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Mr Keating became Treasurer 12 years ago, sales tax represented only $17 a week for a family. We keep on hearing all these comparisons with the bad old days when John Howard was Treasurer. Sales tax, the big consumption tax, was $17 a week for a family when Howard was Treasurer and is $60 a week now. This year, the Keating sales tax will rip $14,000 million from Australian consumers&mdash;that is four times as much as in Mr Howard's last year&mdash;hitting hardest, of course, the lowest income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Keating sales tax is a consumption tax, one of those consumption taxes that all of us should remember, because Paul Keating promised to oppose these in the 1993 election campaign. The Keating sales tax in the latest budget takes about $800 a year per head. It would have taken even more if the coalition had not blocked the Keating government's plan for a new $200 million tax on home building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that the petrol tax&mdash;another Keating consumption tax&mdash;has gone up 43 per cent to its highest ever level in Australia's history of $10,300 million, or almost $600 a year for every man, woman and child in Australia. So together these two Keating consumption taxes take the equivalent of more than $100 a week from a four-person family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just where do these taxes hit? These are the taxes that Senator Cook pretends do not exist&mdash;because he said, `We wouldn't introduce a consumption tax.' There has been a 46 per cent increase in the Keating sales tax on cars&mdash;not luxury cars, just ordinary cars. The $15,000 sort of car&mdash;and that is not the rich man's car, that is more the battler's car&mdash;cops a sales tax of $2,275. The sales tax on the top of the Holden range, the Australian-built Australian car, is up over $2,000 to more than $6,500-odd&mdash;$6,500 sales tax on an Australian-made car. A great incentive&mdash;isn't it?&mdash;for Australian manufacturers to make Australian cars and for Australian consumers to buy them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a 30 per cent increase since the last election on the wine and cider sales tax. It is now up to 26 per cent. There has been a 20 per cent rise in the sales tax the Keating government has imposed on everyday domestic items like refrigerators and washing machines. People do not realise they are paying it because they do not see it on the bill, but it is there. Every time they buy a washing machine, Mr Keating's hands are in their pocket taking out a sales tax that has gone up 20 per cent since he promised to oppose consumption taxes at the 1993 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are these items where the sales tax has gone up 20 per cent? Heaters, stoves, toasters, mixers, kettles, percolators, fans, utensils, cutlery, glassware, crockery, vases, furniture, carpets, drapery, beds, sheets and blankets, lighting, baths, hot water systems, shower fittings, toilets, septics and pump outs, matches, maps and street directories, sewing and knitting machines; and foods like biscuits, snack foods, flavoured milk, fruit and vegetable juices, cordials, ice cream and confectionery. Yes, they hit the kids too, don't they? The Keating sales tax has gone up 20 per cent on flavoured milk, ice creams and those sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a big increase of 10 per cent to a 22 per cent Keating sales tax on hygiene and health items like toothpaste. You have to pay 22 per cent sales tax when you buy some toothpaste, or toilet paper. Toilet paper is apparently a luxury. You have to pay 22 per cent to Paul Keating every time you buy some toilet paper. As well as some sunscreens, there is a 22 per cent Keating sales tax on soaps, detergents, disinfectants, insecticides, shaving items, cosmetics, hair brushes, deodorants, transportation like commercial vehicles, bikes, caravans, oils, spare parts and batteries; business items like office equipment and machines, air conditioning and so on; stationery including recycled paper; personal items like sunglasses, wallets, handbags, umbrellas, toys, games, sporting equipment; and household items like lawn mowers, hoses and sprinklers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But you have to pay a 32 per cent Keating sales tax on TVs and VCRs, radios, tape recorders, record and CD players. I wonder whether young Australians who spend so much of their savings on these items realise that every time they buy a CD player they are paying 32 per cent of the wholesale price to Mr Keating in sales tax&mdash;to the man who said he would not have a consumption tax. What hypocrisy! What incredible front by Senator Cook who avoids paying sales tax on shaving equipment because he prefers to have a beard and so avoids paying all this money to Mr Keating in 22 per cent sales tax on those items. He is the man who says we will not have a consumption tax.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

But I take the same sort of exception to your remark, Senator O'Chee, as I think Senator Patterson took to earlier remarks. It is a matter of concern that there may be exceptions from time to time to the rules that are there to get some kind of equity and fairness in how people are dealt with in finance, vis a vis the pension. This is an example which under the present legislation cannot be dealt with. For a balance in the deliberations and comments here this evening, I am happy to say on the record that Minister Baldwin is looking at this matter. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The Commonwealth entered into an agreement with Plywood &amp; Plastic Pty Ltd ("Plywood"), the former owner of the Ravenshoe Sawmill in June 1988 to provide financial assistance to enable the restructuring of the sawmill following World Heritage Listing of the wet tropics of North Queensland. In December 1992, the Commonwealth commenced proceedings in the Federal Court against Plywood, National Associated Plywood Pty Ltd (in liquidation)("National") and Mr Hugh Ferguson Macdonald (a director of Plywood &amp; National) for alleged contraventions of the Trade Practices Act (1974). Plywood was placed in receivership in April 1990 and has since ceased trading. National was placed in liquidation in October 1990. Accordingly, any judgment entered against either company is not likely to be satisfied. This claim by the Commonwealth relates to the recovery of $968,841 of approximately $7.6 million paid in financial assistance provided in the form of annual operating subsidies and a loan to Plywood in respect of the Ravenshoe Sawmill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any disclosure by the AGS of the terms of settlement beyond that which was agreed to by the Commonwealth and the Third Respondent, and now the subject of a Court order, would not only breach the terms upon which these proceedings were settled, but may also be a contempt of court and compromise the Commonwealth's credibility as a litigant.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government is aware that veterinary steroids are used illegally by body builders. It is difficult to quantify the exact numbers of people abusing steroids and, in particular, those who are illegally using animal steroids as body building agents but the issue is being addressed as part of a comprehensive steroids strategy. A question on use of steroids was included for the first time in the 1995 National Drug Strategy Household Survey. The results of the survey indicated that less than 1% of the population had used steroids in the last 12 months. The survey did not attempt to distinguish the type of steroids used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All anabolic substances, whether they be designated for animal or human use, entering Australia are subject to import controls. People wishing to import steroids must seek permission from my Department which takes steps to minimise the risk that those imports are diverted to the illegal market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee (NDPSC) has recommended controls on the availability of anabolic steroids such that they be available only on prescription (Schedule 4), and the States should impose additional regulations which would make it illegal to possess these drugs without authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An exception has been made for testosterone esters which have a specific therapeutic use for the treatment of pizzle rot in sheep.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Controlling the supply of steroids is a major focus of the National Anabolic Substances Strategy which was endorsed by the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy in June 1995. The Government is working with State and Territory governments, as well as non-Government groups including veterinary associations, to implement the National Strategy and reduce the harm to the Australian community caused by abuse of anabolic substances including steroids.</PARA>
