<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Inappropriate non-appropriation, and I would also like to call it misappropriation in this case. I will not go back over that. I also touched on the diesel fuel slug that the government will bring in, but that is a debate for another day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another indication of the lack of non-appropriation or misappropriation or whatever we would like to call it is the case of the ABC VLW short wave transmitter that used to cover an area the size of New South Wales in the Pilbara, east Gascoyne, west Gascoyne and part of the Murchison area in Western Australia. That was shut off without notice by this government some 12 months ago because the short wave transmitter in that area had come to the end of its useful life after 30 years. It was simply a matter of providing about $2 million for a new transmitter, which I am sure would last for the next 30 years, to permit radio transmission in those remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who have not been to those areas would not believe that there are households, in fact hundreds of people out there&mdash;not just the 20 or 30 people this government has said would be affected by cutting off and taking away the basic radio facilities out there&mdash;on cattle stations in the area, as mining tenants, in mining exploration groups or just as tourists who happen to be going through. Short wave is the only way to deliver radio transmission in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told by this government that it will put in an extra AM transmitter in, I believe, Dalwallinu and perhaps in Meekatharra. People who know about radio communications in those vast areas&mdash;and we are talking about an area bigger than the size of New South Wales&mdash;know that an AM transmitter would not reach anywhere near far enough. Of course, FM transmitters only transmit in small towns; they could not go beyond that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have written to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), I have phoned the minister and I have sent submissions to the minister, but we have had no reaction whatsoever to our request to get these basic facilities back into these areas. It is an utterly ridiculous situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also been told by the government that these isolated stations can put an earth station in their backyard to pick up the satellite to receive basic services such as television and ABC radio. What was not mentioned was that this costs at least $3,000 and some of these remote stations have them anyway. Everyone gets the ABC for 8c a day, we were told, so why should these people in remote areas not have those basic facilities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, these earth stations have to be powered by AC power. There is no electricity connected from the mains in those remote areas. That means, of course, that you have to run the generator during the day if you want to listen to the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS> at lunchtime. It is totally ridiculous and I believe that this government should be condemned for not putting in the measly $2 million to replace a transmitter that is 30 years old and which services a vast number of people in those areas who are actually producing the wealth of this country. The Pilbara of Western Australia alone provides around 15 per cent of Australia's export income. A small number of people in a vast area are producing so much for Australia but they are ignored when it comes to these basic services. I believe the government stands condemned; there is time yet to redress the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should also be doing something towards providing finance for a much needed new phase National Highway to connect the goldfields of Western Australia to the iron ore Pilbara region of Western Australia. I will talk about that in this place another day to let the government know what its responsibilities should be there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity in debate on these appropriation bills to make some remarks about defence, with particular reference to the review of the land force that is currently taking place and the implications this may hold for the Army reserve. This review, which is being undertaken by a panel of military and civil Defence officers, was signalled in last year's landmark Defence white paper. In the section dealing with land operations, the white paper states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A review of the land force to be completed by late 1995 will establish what further adjustments to its structures are necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review will address a range of issues including the number and readiness of infantry units, the balance between the regulars and the reserves and the resource implications for further change.</PARA>
<PARA>A long-held view has existed in the defence department that the Army land command reserve component, comprising eight brigades, including one ready reserve brigade, is too large and should be reduced to two or three brigades. The Army's reserve personnel strength of around 22,000 general reserves, 2,462 ready reserves and 3,608 reserves without a training obligation, all of which comprise 60 per cent of the Army's combat force, periodically incites calls from the department to decrease reserve numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a tragedy for the Army, as well as being against the national interest, if the land force review recommended lessening the importance of the reserves. If it did that, it would have the effect of dimming, if not extinguishing, the national focus on the Army reserve commitment which is achieved through every state being a home to a reserve brigade, or at least sharing one, in the case of the smaller states of Tasmania and South Australia. Such a recommendation would also be at odds with the white paper's assertions that `additional emphasis will be given to the role of defence personnel' and `individual training standards for reserves will be similar to those of regulars, and reserve units will be better equipped and prepared'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly urge the government to ensure that the land force review is not used by the defence department as an impetus to promote any reduction in reserve personnel numbers. Since the formation at federation of the Australian military forces, the home defence army, which was the result of the unification of volunteer military and naval forces and the army reserve, has provided an essential link between the professional fighting force and the wider community. If current and future generations of Australians are to continue to appreciate the need for a defence force, supported by their tax dollar, this link between the professional defence force and the community should not be weakened in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fiscal imperatives have driven army land command to undertake a review of the location of reserve depots across Australia. This program of depot review and rationalisation is a result of the increasing demands on army to become more cost efficient, combined with a relocation of resources to the north. While the focus of the depot review is on the uneconomic use of facilities, those where only a small number of reservists parade&mdash;not on overall reserve numbers&mdash;I am concerned that despite the clear direction of the white paper towards greater utilisation of reserves in the future, this program of depot review taking place in a climate of rationalisation would encourage defence bureaucrats to say, `Hang on, let's not fiddle at the edges with small economy drives; let's do what we always sought to do, take the broad-brush approach and dissolve some of those reserve brigades.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any such recommendation should be rejected out of hand by Senator Robert Ray. The review of depot locations will consider such factors as training numbers, future viability and the importance to the local community before any further steps are taken. Depots found to be uneconomic will either be closed or consolidated with those of neighbouring units and transformed into multi-user depots where several platoons will come together to train and parade, and share facilities and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unit location of specific depots under review is not currently publicly available. With the strategic focus now trained north, and following the 1991 force structure review leading to the extensive relocation of forces to northern Australia, it is difficult to imagine that the Townsville-based 11th Brigade with around 30 units in North Queensland&mdash;many undertaking on the ground surveillance and early warning functions&mdash;would be affected. A lot of them are in the Torres Strait Islands and are staffed by Islanders. Some of the depots are in Weipa and some of the other Aboriginal communities. I would be loathe to see any of those close because Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people enjoy their military training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, for Queensland's other general reserve brigade, Brisbane-based 7th Brigade, it could well be a different matter. The 7th Brigade maintains units in Yandina, Maryborough, Gympie, Gatton, Bundaberg, Toowoomba, Laws, Meandarra, Warwick, Stanthorpe, Goondiwindi, Dalby, Roma and Wondai. With the white paper's assertion that the location of some of the depots reflects demographic characteristics which existed during and after the Second World War, it does not require great genius to conclude that depots in small country centres would be among those under review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last couple of weeks I was out at Goondiwindi and I was approach by several supporters of the 25th Battalion who expressed their concern about the possible closure of No. 3 platoon depot. The personnel strength of No. 3 platoon in Goondiwindi reflects the cyclical and seasonal variations that govern rural and regional Australia. While during parts of the year only a couple of reservists might parade at Goondiwindi, at other times, between plantings and harvesting, there may consistently be more people free to meet their training obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The army is mindful of the distances some reservists in country areas must travel to train. If distances preclude them from parading regularly, the army extends special status conditions that allow them to train at specified periods at their own convenience. While it is the duty of the commanding officer to report up the military chain and make representations on behalf of his unit to keep their depot open, in view of the fact that the reserve has always been regionally based, I urge the government to take into account the seasonal fluctuations of the regions before making any decisions. We just heard from Senator Panizza that some radio station facilities have been withdrawn from regional and rural Western Australia. I am concerned that the same thing may happen in the defence department in regional and rural Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As rural and regional Australians know only too well from bitter experience, once something is lost and once a service is taken away, it is gone forever. Many reserve units have a long entrenched history in country Australia and provide one of the focal points of community life. Willing country Australians should not be excluded from making their contribution to Australia's defence at a local level. To seek budgetary saving through the rationalisation of the reserves as some defence bureaucrats advocate would be a completely false and misguided saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 10 years, defence funding has continually declined as a proportion of GDP. This year's budget saw defence allocated $9.9 billion, which is two per cent of GDP. That is down from 2.1 per cent last year and wel down from 2.6 per cent of GDP in 1982-83. The government's across-the-board running cost cuts to all portfolios saw defence receive a one per cent cut in value of around $48 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government thinks defence should endure further cuts, I point to the $56.4 million allocated in this year's budget for the Russell defence offices redevelopment to see whether any savings could be made at that defence installation. The diarchic nature of defence administration and the resultant cost involved in running the Australian Defence Force headquarters and a departmental headquarters could also stand some scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week in Brisbane saw the annual chief of general staff exercise. This high-powered military conference was attended by senior defence officers of the three services and their overseas counterparts from 20 participating countries, defence bureaucrats and academics. The theme of the CGS exercise was the role of armies in nation building. Given the great role played by both the regulars and the reservists in securing this nation, particularly considering this commemorative year when Australia remembers the valiant war efforts of service men and women in Europe and the Pacific, any move to reduce reserve numbers would be inappropriate and utterly misguided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the army continues to discharge its contribution to the ADF's twin mission of representing a credible force that is self-reliant in the region as well as meeting its United Nations peacekeeping and humanitarian obligations in an increasingly fiscally stringent economic climate, there is no alternative other than for the reserves to shoulder their share of the defence burden. Indeed, the white paper foreshadows this development with a statement that reserve elements no longer exist solely to assist the rapid expansion of the permanent forces during mobilisation for war. I will quote from it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead, reserves now have specific roles in defending Australia in short-warning conflict, both as individuals and formed units.</PARA>
<PARA>I urge the government to adopt the white paper's unequivocal direction of greater utilisation of the reserves and to dismiss out of hand any clamourings for the cutbacks in reserve numbers that may emanate from the department following the land force review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to speak on the appropriation bills to review Labor's 13th budget. It is the 13th time a Labor Treasurer has stood before Australians and told them how well off they are. It is the 13th time Labor has tried to dupe Australians with overblown rhetoric. Thirteen years ago our foreign debt stood at $23 billion. Today it is $160 billion, and growing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's budgeted current account deficit stands at a staggering $27 billion, and unemployment is just coming off postwar record highs. Our current account, as a percentage of GDP, is the largest in the OECD, bar Mexico. What a shameful statistic for such a resource rich nation. The current account is now the principal constraint on achieving sustainable economic growth. Until we cure it, we are locked into the boom-bust cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Messrs Keating and Willis sat down with their union mates to formulate this budget, their main aim was to win the next election&mdash;by fair means or foul. To frame a responsible budget, good for all Australians, did not come into it. I stress `for all Australians', because there are so many who are not getting a fair go these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business people, timber workers, average mums and dads, farmers and battlers have been left behind as Labor continues to pursue its cosy relationship with the ACTU. It does not matter whether you happen to be a cattleman in Casino, a canegrower in Clarence, a baker in Bathurst, a butcher in Ballina or a timber worker in Tumut. No matter how you earn your living&mdash;that is assuming you are lucky enough to have a job these days&mdash;the fact is that country people, regional dwellers, all over New South Wales have once again been forgotten by this uncaring, uncountry Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the drought, agriculture, forestry and fishing outlays in the budget still account for only 1.5 per cent of total budget expenditure. In the budget papers the government claims $1,989 million is spent on these sectors of the economy, but in truth $703 million is already contributed directly by farmers in levies and charges themselves. While the government claims it will spend $519 million on drought aid over the years 1994-95 to 1997-98, it is projecting only $137 million on drought expenditure through the rural adjustment scheme for the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we should have seen in the budget was a more rapid introduction of micro-economic reform and infrastructure competition; removal of the restrictions on job creation created in the government's inappropriate industrial relations laws; the facilitation of business investment by encouraging savings, not increasing company tax; and a commitment to low inflation and low interest rates, because a one per cent rise in interest rates costs farmers alone about $150 million. Above all, this budget should have seen an overall commitment to productivity and to national savings, both of which are essential for economic recovery. It is unrealistic to expect that business investment will increase 13 per cent when the government has slugged companies with a tax rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major study of 2,100 companies undertaken by Kelly Services shows that there will be a massive increase in job shedding and lower levels of recruitment during the remainder of 1995. The survey found that the jobs growth for the quarter ending 30 June would be the lowest level of increase for five years since the depths of Mr Keating's recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year we got the easy options budget&mdash;the fudge-it budget. Labor has fudged the hard spending decisions, cashed in public assets to the tune of $5 billion and put its hands in our pockets for more tax revenue. Taking account of asset sales, special dividends from government enterprises, loan repayments and a range of other financial fiddles, the outcome of the budget is not a surplus&mdash;it is a large deficit. The real deficit is $8.2 billion, and this is to be found deep and hidden in the government's own budget papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has a long and sorry history of slippages in its asset sales timetables. Qantas is, perhaps, the best example we have seen of this. It has appeared on the budget papers for the last four years. There is no reason to believe that Labor will achieve its asset sales targets for 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of the family silver is breathtaking in its cynicism. The asset sales policy is not driven by a concern for efficiency in public enterprises but is simply a squalid scramble for funds to pay for the government's bankrupt economic policies. As I have said, the imperative is for Mr Keating to win the next election at any cost. He knows that the Australian people more than ever demand fiscal responsibility. This is especially so after his record of false hope. This is Labor's last shot in the locker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw at the last election the promises the Prime Minister made and we have seen over the last two years how he has gone back on his commitments. It seems to be a highly contagious disease amongst Labor Party leaders. We have already seen that Premier Carr has been infected with the same bug in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As clever as he thinks he is, the Prime Minister has not reduced the risk of high and rising interest rates in real terms and our exchange rate remains very vulnerable. The Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, said just the other week that there is no certainty in the timing and direction of future interest rate changes. Tax rises will add $2.4 billion to Commonwealth revenue in 1995-96. That equates to a rise of 8.9 per cent in real terms. The rise in the Medicare rate will do nothing to reverse the trend of people opting out of private health cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are on the verge of health disaster. Mr Keating's treatment of the Medicare levy as an additional source of revenue will move us a step closer. Only 35 per cent of the population now has private health cover. The figure was 60 per cent when Labor came to power and the present figure compares very unfavourably with the 40 per cent crisis point that the former health minister, ex-Senator Richardson, referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be remembered that every one per cent fall represents an extra $100 million burden on our public health system. The public system has to extend even to the Prime Minister, who cannot be convinced to join a health fund. What an example the leader of this country has set. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new 12 per cent sales tax on building hardware will further stifle the housing industry. It is estimated that it will add at least $1,000 to the cost of the average home. I welcome the support of the Australian Democrats for the coalition's rejection of this tax in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that Labor is intent on taxing out of existence the great Australian dream of owning a house. Again, Premier Carr in New South Wales is playing his part by increasing royalties on timber by 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is intent on destroying the powerhouse of our economy&mdash;small business. The now infamous statement that Mr Keating made two days after the budget shows his blatant disregard for this vital sector. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If they're feeling the pinch, they ought to say, `Small business is not for me.' Because it's never going to get any better. I mean, this is as good as it ever gets.</PARA>
<PARA>The budget raised the company tax for all incorporated small businesses from 33 per cent to 36 per cent. This will hit small business cash flows, discourage investment and add to the barriers preventing job growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget maintains the provisional tax uplift factor at eight per cent for 1995-96. This is 1.5 times the budget's own forecast for the underlying rate of inflation. The opposition has attempted unsuccessfully to amend this to six per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many small businesses will now have to remit PAYE tax twice monthly, adding to the endless burden of paperwork. Many subcontractors will lose their independent status and be forced into the PAYE tax system. Sadly, the government is unable to understand the massive contribution that small business makes to creating economic growth and job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conversely, in government the coalition will have a fairer capital gains tax system which preserves incentives for small business; it will reduce the paperwork and red tape burden from which small business suffers; it will improve the industrial climate at the work place level and change the absurd Brereton unfair dismissal provisions; and, above all, it will provide a climate of encouragement for small business. For every Australian&mdash;superstitious or not&mdash;Labor's 13th budget is unlucky. Let us hope that it is the last budget that Mr Keating and his government have a chance to bring down. </PARA>

In the last 12 years of this government infrastructure spending, particularly in regional Australia, has gone backwards. If government ministers got out to regional Australia they would be told in the clearest of terms that road funding has gone backwards, that rail funding has gone backwards, that ports are in very much need of upgrading, that telecommunications are practically non-existent in regional Australia and that nothing has been spent on water storage since the Fraser government put some money into the Burdekin Dam.</PARA></TALK.START>

Nothing has been spent on infrastructure anywhere in Australia, nothing in regional Australia. That shows this government's interest in that. </PARA>

The last budget attacked viciously the tourism industry. It attacked small business. It attacked anyone who was making a decent go of things in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my contribution to this debate on the appropriation bills I will step back somewhat, as one often does in a second reading speech, and look more at the philosophy and what actually drives the formation of budgets by this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to look particularly at several issues. One is the failure of the government to link policy with revenue raising. Another is the way in which this budget does not fully reveal the full extent of government expenditure. In other words, the budget is not a document of revelation but one which hides much of what the government has in mind even in terms of quite large spending. Then I want to deal with a couple of specific areas in which, I think for very sound reasons, the government has not addressed problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn firstly to the failure of the government to look at the way in which the raising of revenue can be used as a policy instrument. This budget repeats this most potent mistake which has been in every previous budget&mdash;that is, the failure to link policy with revenue raising. Stupidly, it seeks to keep these two important elements separate from each other: revenue is revenue, and policy is policy. It fails to recognise that this approach is totally inconsistent&mdash;I stress `inconsistent'&mdash;with its belief in market forces. It argues that market forces do and should determine what people buy and, more broadly, how they should behave as a consequence of their decisions to purchase or not purchase goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underlying this notion is that every citizen competes to maximise his or her material wellbeing. That being so, the choices that people make will be determined to a significant degree by the relative price of a range of similar goods and services. For instance, if paper made from recycled fibre is 50 per cent more expensive than similar paper made from virgin fibre, the government's market view would indicate that the vast majority of people will make rational decisions and will not buy the recycled product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet this government tries to convince us that it is committed to maximising the use of recycled paper, and it has even set aside some $5 million, I believe, in this budget to convince Australians to act against their best material self-interest and buy the more expensive recycled product. Thus there is a gaping inconsistency in the government's own thinking&mdash;an inconsistency between the philosophy which guides much of its economic thinking, and the thinking which ostensibly, it says, drives much of its policy process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rational economics on a society-wide scale also relies on purchasing choices being based on the price of the good or service reflecting the full cost. Surely the government is aware of the environmental costs of logging in old-growth forests, to say nothing of the legal and administrative costs associated with this activity. The government has been involved in enormous legal costs recently concerning challenges to woodchip licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where do the costs of paper made from virgin fibre appear? The answer is that most of them do not appear. How might one reflect these in the price which the consumer pays? The only reasonable way for these to appear is through the imposition of a tax proportionate to these costs. Again, the government has been quite inconsistent in the way it argues an economic rationalist philosophy, on the one hand, and yet, on the other hand, denies that that leads it in directions contrary to those that it claims to be its policy directions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In similar fashion, the tax in this budget on cars should bear some relation to the greater or lesser cost which the purchase and the use of cars impose on the environment and on the non-transport sectors in the community. The so-called externalities should be internalised&mdash;perhaps more in an economic rationalist world, the world of this government, than in the economics of the environmental movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several years ago, when the government chose to decrease the sales tax on cars, I moved an amendment that the decrease should be proportional to the energy efficiency of the car on a class by class basis. The government failed to observe its own market philosophy and imposed a uniform reduction. Similarly, in this budget the government is seeking to increase the sales tax on cars and should make this increase relate to those externalities which would not otherwise appear in the price of a car. Almost certainly, the government has not even begun to think rigorously and to apply rigorously its own economic logic, and it will ignore in both these instances the use of tax as an instrument of policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this budget, the government also seeks to increase the sales tax on certain building materials. I will interpolate at this point to answer Senator Ian Macdonald's snide comment earlier. It was the opposition when in government in 1981 that sought to impose such a tax, and it was opposed by the Democrats&mdash;and the Democrats are the only party that has been consistent in this regard. Again, this is an across-the-board increase. There is no relation to policy whatsoever, other than that this seems to be a good area in which to grab more revenue. This will increase the price of a house and of house repairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is price elasticity in house purchasing, market theory says that this measure will shift sales away from houses to other things. To some extent, this may be what we are already seeing. Is this what the government wants? I think that is the question the government should be asking. If the government wants to make that shift in terms of purchasing, then this is the way to go. If that is not what the government wants, then this is not the way to go. Again, I make the point that the government should be linking revenue raising with its policy. It may be that this is indeed what the government wants, but I believe that is not the reason for this increase. I do not believe the government has even begun to think in these terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the production of various building materials there are externalities which relate to environmental impacts. Timber can be endlessly renewed if it is grown sustainably, while metals are non-renewable resources. Exploitation of the latter imposes costs on future generations as well as this one. The energy costs of refining and processing of different metals vary enormously. Aluminium requires very large quantities of energy in its smelting. Thus the use of aluminium contributes very significantly to greenhouse gas emissions as well as general air pollution. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just listen to what I am asking, Senator. Where do these environmental costs appear in the price of aluminium? Why does the government not follow through with its so-called commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by levying a tax on materials such as metals proportionate to the carbon emissions which their smelting releases? Why did the government not bite the bullet and impose a sensible carbon tax rather than this silly and unjustifiable across-the-board tax on building materials, irrespective of their contribution to environmental damage?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preferred option of the Australian Democrats is to go much further with this arrangement and to hypothecate or direct taxes into specific targets. In this way, both taxing and spending would become part of the implementation of policy. For example, we have long argued that a carbon tax should not be used as a revenue raising measure but that the money collected through this tax should be used very specifically to encourage the use of the alternative non-fossil fuel based technologies. A large fund to help with the purchase price of solar hot water services would be one use of such taxes. We are not saying that the tax should just disappear into general revenue; it should go back into the community to encourage and deliberately shift the whole industrial base in the direction which the government's policy says that it should be shifted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People need hot water. In this way, they can have their hot water without the accompanying greenhouse gas emissions associated with the burning of fossil fuel to make the electricity to make the water hot. Stand-alone renewable power supplies in remote areas such as western New South Wales would be another example. Enormous economic savings could be generated through that mechanism. When suggestions such as this have been made in the past, the government has argued that it is not prepared to hypothecate taxes to specific purposes. Yet in this budget the government is imposing a tax on airport users to cover very specifically the amelioration of airport noise at Sydney airport. The government is totally inconsistent. It uses whatever assertion it wishes to substitute for argument. In addition, we have seen taxes on alcohol and tobacco used in part as policy instruments for many years. So the government's argument that it is not prepared to hypothecate or raise taxes in relation to policy is inconsistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area I want to pick up on is the failure to show all the expenditures in this budget, including some quite large ones. Within a few days of the budget being brought down, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was in Adelaide pork-barrelling the South Australian electorate. Specifically, he promised $130 million to realign the south-eastern freeway down the hills face into Adelaide. As one very interested in increasing road safety by getting as much freight off roads and onto rail, I had been lobbying the government very hard for just $5 million for the upgrade and standardisation of the Wolseley to Mount Gambier line. This line has been isolated by the standardisation of the Melbourne to Adelaide line. The total cost of upgrading this 220 kilometres of line is $8 1/2 million, of which only $5 million was required from the federal Department of Transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On budget night I found a very specific line item in the budget&mdash;$5 million for the upgrading of grain lines in South Australia. I thought that this may be what I had been seeking. But no, this was for the upgrade of the line to Pinnaroo, which is important, but there was nothing in the budget for the Mt Gambier line, which would take over 200,000 tonnes of freight off road each year and put it on to rail. How can the government be so specific in its budget papers and show an amount of $5 million for the upgrade of a specific rail line but fail to show $130 million for expenditure on 8 1/2 kilometres of road?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely. I agree with you on this occasion, Senator Macdonald. Clearly, the budget is not the document in which this government reveals its spending plans to the Australian people. It is not the document in which it comes clean with the electorate over important resource allocation. The budget is a document of deception where the government hides as much of its wheelings and dealings as it chooses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shortly after this trip to Adelaide, the Prime Minister was exalting the opening of the standard gauge line between Adelaide and Melbourne. He did not mention that the last time the part of this main intercapital line through the Adelaide Hills was realigned was in the early 1920s, that the standardisation of the line has taken place on the old and totally inadequate alignment, that realignment of this line would take as much as two hours off the travel time between the two capitals and would cost a great deal less than the $130 million for the 8 1/2 kilometres of six-lane freeway through the same area. It is extremely doubtful whether turning the 10 1/2 kilometres of winding downhill road into 8 1/2 kilometres of much steeper road will make the road any safer for heavy transport, especially as there is a very sharp bend which will still remain right at the bottom of the slope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the Prime Minister hide $130 million from the budget? How can this money find its way to road while so little has been spent and is being spent on rail? Is the government really committed to transport energy efficiency as part of its ESD policy? Again, the inconsistency between the rhetoric and the reality is glaring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the question of expenditure on science. In this budget, as in previous budgets, the government has failed to adequately address the need for more government funding for science, especially basic and strategic research which is not funded from private sources. This is not surprising given the government's failure to understand the proper role of science in a modern industrial society. Science in Australia will continue to become more derivative, to depend more heavily on basic science conducted in other countries and the contribution which Australia makes to the advancement of science will continue to decline. I developed this theme in more detail in an urgency debate in the last sitting week so I did not intend to stress the point here. But I could not let a speech on the budget and the way in which the government chooses to allocate money go by without making that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to spend a few moments on the environment because the failure to spend on the environment is linked to some extent with the failure to spend on science. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) was very careful in his answers to questions on this point in the estimates committee hearings, continuing to claim that the spending in his department&mdash;I stress the words `in his department'&mdash;is increased in this budget. Questions about the cutbacks on the spending on environment in other portfolios were ignored as not within his jurisdiction. The fact is that there has been a massive cut in environmental spending under other ministers and the increase claimed by the government is nothing like the real change at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some extent, comparisons with last year raise the question: what spending is required on the environment in Australia if we are to move this country towards ecologically sustainable development? The amount required is a massive increase on the present paltry amount. We have not turned around the problems of soil loss and salinisation, we still have hundreds of species on the threatened species list, and we will continue to lose more species because of the failure of this government to pass adequate, comprehensive legislation to nationally protect our wildlife and to provide enough money to establish the data on which protection must be based. Just one recent indication of this is found in the failure to find the cause of the recent pilchard deaths. Recently we have had a number of questions about the failure of the government to establish the basic data, and that is precisely why it is floundering in identifying the cause of those deaths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also failed to stop the rape of our old-growth forests, having failed to spend enough on plantations which could replace timber and chips for houses and paper. Coastal degradation continues apace, the $55 million in this budget being quite inadequate to redress the enormous damage which has accumulated over the years. Most of the money is being spent on improving the aesthetic appearance of beaches and foreshores, and none will be used to tackle the really major problems of sewage and stormwater run-off which is causing such havoc in our marine inshore environments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allocation in the budget is tiny compared with the $8 billion needed to clean up just Sydney's sewage outfall alone. Similar amounts are needed in most cities such as Perth which faces a serious ground water pollution problem due to the extensive use of septic tanks. These are not state problems; they are national problems. The percentage of GDP flowing through the federal coffers is about five times the combined amount going through all state governments and local governments, pointing to the difficulty faced by these other levels of government in tackling these major problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a poor budget. It fails to advance any principle of policy; it seeks merely to raise revenue where it thinks it can get away with it; and it fails to spend nearly enough on some very important key areas such as science and its related research, and the environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to make some comments on the appropriation bills we now have before us. I particularly wish to deal with one aspect of the budget; that is, the overall increase in taxation which will be collected in the coming financial year. As I understand it, this is the largest tax collection increase in the history of this Commonwealth, in all its 93 years. Some $14 billion extra tax collection will occur. It is to be found at page 21 of the budget papers; it goes from $103 billion to $117 billion in round figures, an increase of $14 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, with regard to the management of the budget, we see that even to balance the budget with those additional increases some $8 billion has to be included through the collection of what I call budget fiddles&mdash;the sale of Qantas and the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Those two items, the sale of Qantas and the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, bring in $5.3 billion in round figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting where the bulk of this increase comes from. The first group that is hit by the increased tax collection this year is commonly known as the ordinary man-in-the-street taxpayer, the PAYE taxpayer. An extra $6.1 billion will be collected from the pockets of PAYE taxpayers. That does not include partnerships, trusts and cases where the taxation system flows down to a situation whereby income tax is also paid in a similar, although not quite the same, form. It affects the PAYE taxpayer; the wage earner in this country. The government will pick up some $6.1 billion of that $14 billion increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the customs tax we see that it will increase by $110 million. We see that company tax will increase by $2.29 billion in the first year and, over the next four years&mdash;and this is one of the tricks, perhaps, that this Labor government has moved towards: in its budgets it puts taxation increases into the future so that they do not show up in the budget before us at a particular time&mdash;we will see that $2.29 billion figure rise to some $4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales tax will increase by some $2.58 billion. Once again, when we look at sales tax, we find a similar situation to that which exists with company tax. With sales tax we are also seeing flowing through into this budget decisions which were made in the Dawkins budget. This budget cannot be analysed in isolation from what was done previously and what is planned for the future. It is one of those slick little tricks whereby the government thinks that it can get away with presenting things in a way that I would not describe as fair and reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 12 per cent increase in sales tax on building materials which has had so much publicity will cover what I would call the necessities of the home&mdash;the kitchen, the bathroom, the laundry and the toilet, the very basic things in a home. This is in a situation of a decline of 32 per cent in new dwelling finance approvals in the last 12 months. Of course, in my state of Western Australia the figure is significantly higher. It has been well documented by a number of builders in the industry that for a four-bedroom home costing between $150,000 and $200,000, which is a fairly typical price for a new home in Perth, Western Australia, the increase in sales tax will be some $2,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must also add to the equation the increased cost of building a house caused by the removal of the diesel fuel rebate on the digging or mining of clay for house bricks. Today I have been given estimates that the removal of the diesel fuel rebate will mean another $1,500 to $2,000 for a double brick home costing $150,000 to $200,000. It seems that this government, through this budget, is determined to place the dream of owning your own home out of reach of young people and those who do not own their own home. It is something that I view very seriously. I do not know why this government, with all its rhetoric, would want to attack people who want to renovate their homes or build their first home. I believe that putting up costs in this manner is unfair and inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we work through such things as the fuel excise or the rebate on off-road operations, I am sure we will find a host of other areas which will be affected. I have no doubt that the impact of the increased sales tax and the removal of the diesel fuel rebate will have significant effects on home building. Included in that will be the off-road transport costs and private road costs. In Western Australia, in particular, many of the mining companies in fact supply and build under contract the very roads on which they drive under a state agreement. Of course, this government, being the type of government it is, is determined to squeeze every last drop it can out of these businesses through the increase in the fuel excise&mdash;once again, quite unjustly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also look at the impact of this budget on sales tax on vehicles. It will raise some $1.5 billion over the four years of additional revenue. The impact of the changes made in the last budget will fall very much on the people in this community who can least afford it, the people in this community who have little opportunity to dodge, walk around or use some system to minimise their tax burden. I have no problem with people operating to minimise their tax under the system but the method that has been used here will directly hit the people I just spoke about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing I want to deal with in the time that has been allocated to me is the increase in the company tax rate from 33 per cent to 36 per cent this year. It is no wonder that people are considering their options&mdash;whether to invest in Australia or offshore, particularly in Asia. Once again I refer to medium-sized Western Australian companies, a number of which I have talked to in recent times, which are now putting their investment dollars into Asia purely and simply because they have no confidence that when they wake up tomorrow, the rules they are operating under will be the same as today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I re-emphasise that the tax take increase in this budget of $14 billion is the largest tax take increase in the history of this nation. It goes from $103 billion to $117 billion. Included in that are customs tax, up $110 million; fringe benefits tax, up $120 million; dividend and interest from mining, up $90 million; company tax up; resource rent tax, up $70 million; and PAYE tax, up $6.1 billion. I conclude my remarks by saying it is absolutely despicable that, in terms of an increase in the tax take of that magnitude, the government has to rely on the sale of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, putting the fiddle across that it is balancing the budget, when the money from those sales should have been used to reduce this nation's debt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are today debating Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2), arising from the budget. The 1995 budget is, the government claims, a tough budget. It certainly is tough, but only in parts. It is tough on small business and the corporate sector which will cop the brunt of the $2.4 billion of new taxes. It is excessively tough on the community services sector, particularly on the health, education, welfare and employment programs. It is also tough on the Senate's capacity to review the business of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, being an election budget, it is very loose on a range of areas where it should have been much tougher. This budget contains a tightening of about $3 billion, $2.4 billion of that being on the tax side of the budget. Excluding assets sales and net advances to the states, outlays rise by $4.4 billion in this budget, a rise in real terms of about 0.5 per cent. Yet this rise disguises large cuts to substantial elements of the social safety net. There is a transfer in this budget from the battlers, the true believers&mdash;low income earning Australians&mdash;to a wide range of powerful lobby groups which, I suppose, government pollsters are saying the government needs to win the next election. I want to look at some of the worst changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will begin with housing assistance. Public housing funding will fall by $44 million in real terms. That will compound the 40 per cent fall in public housing starts in the country over the past three years at a time when public housing waiting lists have blown out by about 37,000 applicants to now over 230,000 on the list nationally. The low income earners who cannot get a housing commission house but who are relying on rental for their housing are left worst off. Rental assistance will be cut by $6 million, leaving 365,000 households worse off. If they decide to save to buy a house, Labor would have forced a sales tax impost on building, adding $600 to $1,000 to the cost of a new home up front and over $1,800 to $3,000 to its cost over the life of a mortgage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now look at sole parent families. From 1 July 1995, sales tax on a range of goods will rise by one per cent, adding to the cost of living. But compensation for this does not flow until September 1996 for sole parents, and then only at a rate of $1 per week. Sole parent families are one of the poorest segments of our community. It is a segment which the social safety net is clearly failing to assist. Yet this budget contains little or nothing for them, and the almost nothing that it does contain is delayed for 15 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of higher education, we have our annual attempt by DEET to extract more and more money from Austudy and HECS. Each time, it chips away at fairness and equity. The total savings eked out this year will be $135 million in the full year. That money will be taken straight out of the pockets of students and new graduates. So much for encouraging a clever country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also having to look at the government's proposed changes to eligibility for child-care assistance. These changes limit access by what are called priority or category 4 non-working parents&mdash;that is, sole parents at home&mdash;to 12 hours of assisted care per week only. But the largest and most insidious cut has been in grants to the community sector under the title of indexation rationalisations. Tucked away in the budget is this significant measure, which very few people seem to be talking about; that is, the changes to indexation arrangements for certain Commonwealth outlays and for specific purpose payments to the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the changes, indexation for wage costs will be based on the industrial relations safety net adjustment. Indexation for non-wage costs will be based on the Treasury measure of underlying inflation. What that means in practice is that the government will save more than $2 billion over the next four years. The government does not like to refer to this as a cut. I heard someone the other day refer to it not as a real cut but as a cut in aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have great difficulty with this. Whatever the government likes to call it, the Democrats see it as nothing other than quite a significant cut. When $2 billion is taken out of the forward estimates and one then runs around saying that all the relevant funding agreements will be renegotiated to make sure that that target is met, the services at the sharp end of the deal will have great difficulty seeing it in a positive light. What is more, these organisations are basically being told that they will have to wear this reduction irrespective of their individual circumstances, irrespective of whether they are already pared to the bone, irrespective of whether they are as efficient as they can possibly get and irrespective of whether they already have enterprise bargaining, which has traded off wage increases against productivity gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the point that the two yardsticks being used&mdash;the industrial relations safety net adjustment and the Treasury measure of underlying inflation&mdash;are acknowledged as being low. I have great difficulty seeing this as a legitimate measure. It smacks of a nasty little ploy that is part of the overall tactic of dragging the budget into surplus by whatever means available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one sits down and goes through the various portfolios, one can see that a number of areas are significantly affected by these new arrangements. In the health portfolio, for example, virtually no programs will remain unchanged or untouched. I will provide a couple of examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nearly $80 million is coming out of the hospitals, insurance and other health services program, including a reduction of more than $30 million in hospital funding grant expenditure. The home and community care for the aged program loses $133 million. It is all very well for the government to say that services operating under these programs will just have to wear this as a cut in their aspirations and become more efficient, but that is simply not going to be possible for many services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, I get angry at this notion that a cut in expenditure or a cut in the number of workers somehow automatically results in increased efficiency. That notion might have some currency if we are selling hamburgers or tins of paint, but it does not necessarily ring true when one is delivering health services or, in particular, is caring for the elderly or people with disabilities. It can be dressed up in all the jargon one likes, but at the end of the day these indexation changes represent a significant reduction in funding to those areas of public and community services which can least afford to wear it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the issue of the reduction in funding to the Senate so that it can perform its legislative functions. The Senate is the last bastion with the power to review, assess and hold accountable the increasingly arrogant and secretive government. As a former Auditor-General, John Taylor, said in a recent speech, the government likes to attack the Senate, politically and financially, because it is independent, because it is not a rubber stamp, nor a rotten borough, and, when it wants to be, can be very effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The powerhouse of the Senate is its committee structure, and it is here that the government has struck, with a 37 per cent cut in funding to standing committees. That means fewer resources for scrutinising and analysing bills and fewer opportunities for people to have some say in what this government is doing. It is an outright attack from the executive on parliament and an attack that this parliament must resist. We are not talking big dollars here; we are talking, I understand, of an aggregate cut of less than $3 million. That is the cost of the economic round table of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for the next three years, and that must be seen in the total budget context&mdash;a budget of $131 billion. It is surely a small price to pay for a higher level of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Friday we saw the Prime Minister in full flight accusing the Senate of acting `irresponsibly and unreasonably' in refusing to back his plan to extend sales tax to building materials. The Prime Minister publicly advised the Senate to think about its position and not overplay its hand. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should maintain its position as a house of review but should not be there trying to knock bits and pieces off the Government's Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>Several editorials thundered their approval, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph-Mirror</EMPHASIS> in particular, claiming that the Senate was underworked. We all must write a few notes to them about the hours that we actually work. I think 60 to 80 hours a week would probably be average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what the papers are basically saying is that they are quite happy for a government to be elected with a majority in one house, even if, say, only 45 per cent, in this government's case, actually voted for that government as a first preference or, in the case of Bob Hawke's government, only 39 per cent, but governments can then do what they like&mdash;basically unfettered, they can run without any hesitation over the other also democratically elected house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We disagree with this basic line of reasoning. We believe the Senate is a legitimate house of review. It has a role to keep the government accountable when its legislative proposals overreach a threshold test of fairness. That is recognised by the current Treasurer, Ralph Willis, who, in 1981, urged the Senate to vote against the last bill to tax building materials `because they are not in the best interests of this country'. He seems to have forgotten all about that now. In 1967, former Labor Attorney-General and High Court judge Lionel Murphy said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no tradition in the ALP that we will not oppose in the Senate any tax or money bill or what might be described as a financial measure.</PARA>
<PARA>The current Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, defended his decision to vote against those housing bills on the basis that the tax bills are not supply bills. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is not unacceptable in principle for this Senate to oppose the passage of such bills, bills in respect of which the Government not only lacks an explicit mandate but also in respect to which, given its pre-election statements, it has been profoundly dishonest and hypocritical.</PARA>
<PARA>What were this government's pre-election statements regarding the taxation of building? On 4 November 1992 in the other place, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is not about taxing the building industry. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And, in an open letter to builders later that year, he reiterated his opposition to higher indirect taxes on building. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that there is no drastic changes of policy which would choke off economic activity.</PARA>
<PARA>As we see now, we have a very different stance from Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate has a vital role in maintaining Australian democracy. The people of Australia need to know that excesses of the arrogance of this government and like governments are being held in check. The Democrats have shown that what power we have in this place must be exercised responsibly and carefully.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan. Minister, you frequently mention that exports are becoming increasingly diversified and that high value added manufactures and services are becoming an important export earner for Australia. In this morning's newspaper I noticed a report that Telstra has won a major telecommunications contract in Indonesia. I ask: what is the export performance of the telecommunications industry? Will the major contract won by Telstra result in export opportunities for our telecommunications equipment industry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1420" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question reflects the very traditional long-term Labor occupation called jobs. It is one with which we should properly be concerned. It is another indication of our success in generating jobs and exports. Like every other Australian&mdash;certainly every other person on the government side of the chamber&mdash;I am very pleased to see that Telstra has won a major contract in Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telstra and its joint venture partners, as a result of this victory, will invest about $1 billion dollars over the next three to four years and install 400,000 new telephone lines. Telstra, like many other Australian companies, has targeted Indonesia as a major priority and this is its first major contract. Senator Carr is very right to draw attention to the wider implications of that victory. Mr Lee will be talking about its implications for Telstra, but it has important wider implications because the telecommunications industry as a whole will get important opportunities for this and so will other parts of Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the specifics of Senator Carr's question, the telecommunications industry last year exported about $1.2 billion, which is a lot of exports in high value added manufacturing, the fastest growing area of our exports. The industry has estimated that it can achieve $2 billion in equipment and services exports by 1997&mdash;a significant contribution to our exports and the generation of very many jobs. So this is something that flows from the strength of Australia's telecommunications network and its recognition as high quality from the fact that we are a world leader in rural communications, and these characteristics provide a solid basis for supplying telecommunications equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that people who seem not to be interested in this answer appreciate the magnitude of the demand. The World Bank has estimated that in Asia between now and the end of the decade switching and transmission projects alone will be worth up to $170 billion. So it is an enormous market and there will be opportunities for competitive Australian telecommunications equipment suppliers, particularly to work with Indonesian partners and Telstra, to supply this new major project. The bid forms only one part of Indonesia's telecommunications development plans and those suppliers are looking beyond Telstra&mdash;which will be of particular value to them, but they are looking beyond that to supply into other new contracts let from other telecommunications projects in Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major investments such as Telstra also strengthen other parts of the commercial ties between our two countries and lead to potential trade spin-offs not only for telecommunications equipment suppliers but also for other support industries, such as accountancy and legal services. Each time an investment like this occurs it leads to new job opportunities and new export opportunities and strengthens the internationalisation of our economy and the capacity of our economy to generate more jobs.</PARA>

And it is never smart in those situations to fire all your shots at once.' That was John Howard in Cairns.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate Senator Colston on his continuing interest in industry policy. I am pleased to be able to confirm that the outlook for business investment in 1994-95 and 1995-96 is particularly strong for Australia. Investment data to date, including further upward revisions to business investment in the December quarter of the national accounts and investment expectations recorded in the ABS private new capital expenditure survey, the CAPEX survey, have confirmed the strong performance of business investment that we are experiencing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the recovery in business investment occurred earlier than previously thought, with business investment in the year 1992-93 and the year 1993-94 revised up by a total of around $6.2 billion since the last budget. Total business investment is forecast to increase by 18 per cent in year average terms in 1994-95 and by 13 per cent in 1995-96. According to the ABS capital expenditure survey, new private capital expenditure rose by 3.1 per cent in the March quarter 1995 to be 28 per cent higher than a year earlier, manufacturing sector investment rose by 42 per cent over the year and services investment rose by 14 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's import figures show that capital goods imports continue to add to the capital base of our economy and expand therefore our supply capacity. The record growth in plant and equipment investment that we are currently seeing&mdash;23 per cent growth is forecast for 1994-95&mdash;is expected to be sustained by continuing strength in investment fundamentals, that is, fundamental factors conducive to strong investment such as high levels of capacity utilisation, continued corporate profit growth, low debt levels, high levels of retained earnings, low borrowing costs and low underlying inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of inflation, I did note some comments coming out of the CEDA conference last week by Professor Bob Gregory to the effect that productivity growth was really only one per cent a year and that wage pressures would lead to inflation above the Reserve Bank's objective of two per cent to three per cent underlying inflation over the course of the cycle. I would like to put on record that this is not consistent with our current performance, nor is there any basis for fears of a wages break-out. National account figures indicate that in the four years since March 1991 real GDP per hour worked increased by 8.3 per cent or two per cent per year. In the non-farm sector productivity growth on this measure was even higher at 13.4 per cent, that is, a little over three per cent a year. In fact, it was 4.1 per cent in trend terms through the year to the March quarter 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no evidence that this growth is slowing down. In fact, given the government's continuing micro-economic reform program, measures taken by private firms to achieve world's best practice and the enterprise bargaining process which delivers productivity based wage outcomes, there is every reason to believe that a continuing rate of productivity growth of around two per cent per year remains achievable for some time into the future. The NAB business survey has demonstrated that this view is shared by the private sector. Respondents expect strong growth in private sector productivity of around two per cent for 1995-96 and around 2.2 per cent per year over the medium term.</PARA>

The important thing that Secretary Perry said today, as reported on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>, is that the United States is observing the moratorium and is planning to continue to observe it. It is very important that we note that. It happens in democracies&mdash;it has even been known to happen in Australia&mdash;that governments have a difference of opinion from time to time, and some of the different views leak out into the media before the official decision is announced by the government.

Under the test ban treaty, it has been accepted that there needs to be the capacity for laboratory experiments and simulations, and I understand that that is the context of the consideration within the United States.</PARA>

He was referring to the longstanding debate on the scope of the CTBT, currently under negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament. The position I took yesterday stands: we are absolutely opposed to nuclear testing by any state. We were disturbed by those reports, and we welcome the firm assurance by Secretary Perry that the US is not considering lifting its longstanding moratorium on nuclear testing. I can assure you that we have acted promptly to ensure that the United States is aware of our views on this.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the recycled economic question from the opposition, full of worst interpretations, talking down the economy and sabotaging the very strong levels of economic growth that Australia is experiencing. This current year we are looking forward to achieving a 4 1/2 per cent level of economic growth and a 3 3/4 per cent growth next financial year. That is strong growth in Australian terms and that is leading to a reduction in unemployment, and a significant one at that. It is leading to a massive program of job creation as well, and a significant one at that. It has led to an underlying rate of inflation of 1.9 per cent, something that the opposition has never been able to achieve in its period in office. It has led to a huge influx of foreign investment and a huge purchase of capital goods by Australian industry in order to expand its capacity so that the economy can continue to grow without the constraints on capacity which will have a deleterious effect on inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Figures were referred to in the introduction to this question. The merchandise import figures ought to be seen in the context of looking at both the imports and the exports; this is just the imports side of the equation. They also ought to be seen in the context of looking at goods and services; this is just the goods side of the equation. I counsel opposition senators to wait until 29 June when the balance of payments figures come out because they will be a better snapshot of where the balance of payments figures are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see from these figures is an import performance stronger than the market expected. That is true, but the range of market expectations is so wide as to suggest a high level of volatility in these figures. Notwithstanding all that and given the strong economic growth in the Australian economy, it is not surprising, given the internationalised nature of our economy, that there should be a higher level of imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to look at the composition of these imports. The strongest growth in the month was on capital goods. We are importing more capacity to produce more goods in Australia, and that is a good thing. The next strongest is in intermediate goods&mdash;goods imported into the Australian economy to be improved and modified here. That is also a strong indicator. The third and last strongest growth is in consumption goods, which shows that demand in the Australian economy is still quite high and reflects strong investment and strong consumer demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, these figures on merchandise imports referred to as the platform upon which the rest of this rhetoric has been launched indicate that we are expanding our productive capacity and we are pushing out the production constraints on the economy. That means that inflation expectations have been dampened by the publication of these figures. It also ought to be said that the trend these figures show is consistent with the budget forecast. In the budget we forecast a current account deficit of $27 billion for 1994-95 and 1995-96. These figures are in line with that. Regardless of the little weight we place on them, we can at least make that deduction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht. I refer the minister to the statement made by the Treasurer in his budget speech in relation to excise on light fuel oils. Given that the major users of light fuel oils are rail operators and coastal shipping, which are seen as relatively efficient users of fuel from an environmental perspective, how can the minister justify the Treasurer's claim that substitution of light fuel oil for diesel is taking place at some cost to the environment? When will these proposed changes to excise on light fuel take effect, and is it true that these changes will initially be effected by gazettal? Given the problems faced by the tourist industry with respect to forward bookings, does the minister not concede that any changes to excise or taxation that affect that industry should be phased in?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1426" SPEAKER="Schacht Sen The Hon C.C." NAMEID="4J4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="SMALL BUSINESS, CUSTOMS AND CONSTRUCTION" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that in the government's budget there was an announcement that the excise rate for what is colloquially called light fuel oil would be raised from the present rate of around 6c a litre to the normal diesel fuel rate of 32c a litre. The reason for doing so was that when light fuel oil&mdash;which actually is heavier than diesel fuel oil but lighter than shipping oil or bunker oil&mdash;was first brought in with an excise of 6c, it was never envisaged that it would be used in substitution for diesel fuel in normal trucks, boats, et cetera. However, over recent years, as people realised&mdash;particularly oil companies and major users&mdash;that they could make adaptations to their diesel engines with filters so that they could use the light fuel oil and pay only 6c rather than 32c, there has been a growing market for people to come in and substitute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true, apparently, that rail is one of the major users. There are other users, and Senator Margetts has mentioned some marine operators and tourist operators&mdash;and that is true. It is estimated by Customs, which administers the excise, that already we were losing $100 million a year in revenue through the substitution of light fuel oil for diesel oil. It was never the policy intention of this government, or of the previous government, to allow the substitution of light fuel oil for what was always considered technically to be diesel oil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had evidence that in recent years some oil companies have been promoting the substitution of a light fuel oil product and were approaching normal trucking companies in Australia, saying, `If you adapt your diesel engine on an interstate truck you will be able to use light fuel oil and save yourself 26c a litre'. If that had taken hold as a major substitution in the interstate trucking business in Australia, it is estimated that within three of four years we would have lost over $1 billion a year in excise on diesel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say, Senator Margetts, that I am advised that if all the interstate trucks in Australia used light fuel oil&mdash;and it is called light fuel oil although it is a heavier polluting fuel than normal diesel&mdash;because it is 26c a litre cheaper, it would have an adverse effect on the environment. I am sure the WA Greens would not be supportive of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the government took the view that, unless it took measures now to stop the substitution, it would grow at such a rate that the revenue in excise would be substantially wrecked, and that would have a major implication for the budget. An amount of $100 million this year would have meant a reduction of nearly 15 per cent in the government surplus announced in the budget; $1 billion in three or four year's time would put us substantially back into deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I have to say to you, Senator Margetts, that although there will be people in the community who have been using the light fuel oil as a substitute and who are not happy about the decision of the government, the government is very firm that this measure has to be supported by the parliament. Otherwise we will end up with a number of consequences which will basically mean that taxes will have to be raised somewhere else to make up for a possible loss in three or four years of $1 billion.</PARA>

The government of the day has up to one year to introduce the legislation into parliament. Of course, if the Senate wants to act further in the unprecedented way of rejecting those measures, obviously the government of the day will have to deal with that at the time. I would have to say that if you want to encourage the Senate to reject the change on light fuel oil, I hope you will propose how Australian taxpayers in two or three year's time will raise the up to $1 billion in lost revenue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. A coalition of eight peak consumer and welfare organisations yesterday described your government's superannuation policy as `unfair', `inefficient', `short-sighted' and `not cost-effective or equitable'. What response does your government have to this damning attack on its policy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I respond to the question, might I say that because of this government's move on superannuation, superannuation now is the right of all Australians. When the opposition was in power, superannuation was the right only of those in government service and white collar jobs. In superannuation we have extended one of the greatest social reforms this country has seen. The criticisms of those welfare groups was criticism not of the idea of the scheme but of some of the details of its implementation, with which I will now deal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been surprised by reports that our retirement incomes policy is bad for low income earners. Claims that the scheme will mean that many retirees, especially women, will have inadequate protection from poverty are clearly inaccurate claims. They fail to take into account that our retirement incomes policy has two key elements: the provision of an adequate age pension for those in greatest need, and the enhancement and spread of superannuation. Together they aim to provide an improved standard of living for older people in retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our savings for our future plan builds on more than a decade of reform in retirement incomes by this government to achieve fair and sustainable outcomes for older Australians within the context of an ageing population. Unlike the opposition, which has no spokesperson, let alone a policy, we have a coherent retirement incomes policy framework, with the cornerstone remaining the provision of an adequate age pension. Since 1983 the age pension has increased in real terms by 12 per cent. That is in sharp contrast to the situation under the coalition, when pensions fell in real terms by 2.3 per cent. Unlike the opposition, we have a longstanding commitment to provide a pension equal to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. We have also maintained twice yearly indexation of pensions&mdash;something the Leader of the Opposition got rid of in his first budget as Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government will continue to provide the strong safety net for those in greatest need while encouraging better retirement incomes through its superannuation provisions. Superannuation has been transformed from its early role under the opposition of a tax advantaged form of saving offered only to a minority, to a benefit enjoyed by nearly 90 per cent of Australian employees. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Saving for our future</EMPHASIS>, the government announced measures to introduce employee contributions and to match these dollar for dollar with government contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim that low income people will be forced to give up a large amount of wages for little or no benefit in retirement ignores the fact that the employee contributions of three per cent will be phased in over a three-year period and met from prospective wage increases. Our decision to pay the second round of One Nation tax cuts as superannuation contributions directly benefits low to middle income earners, because the government contribution will be means tested and subject to a cap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our superannuation initiatives will result in low income groups unequivocally being better off in retirement. There seems to be little understanding of the fact that the entitlement to the age pension will only ever be reduced by 50c in the dollar for each additional dollar of private income above $2,340 per annum for a single person and above $4,056 for a couple. Older people will always enjoy a better retirement with some private income supplemented by their age pension. With the greatest respect to that coalition of worthy organisations, I do not think they have understood the significance of these reforms. Even if they argue, as they may, that they are right, they would not in any sense want to embrace the alternative, the opposition, which would return them to an even worse situation in terms of their security in retirement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>I asked a question today of Senator Schacht in relation to light fuel oil and there are parts of the question which were not answered. One of those matters concerns what mechanism is available if the Senate fails to agree on a gazetted tax. The minister did not come clean; he did not say whether it would be written into legislation.

The first is that it fully expects the legislation to pass. Without this assurance, there is no ethical basis for imposing a tax prior to passage of law. The second, which materially justifies the practice, is that there is a real danger that foreknowledge of a tax can allow a market to be manipulated or allow some party to make huge windfall gains.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case it is likely&mdash;or certainly possible&mdash;that the tax will be rejected by the Senate. There is no ethical basis for taxing in this way. It is also not likely that anyone can take action in a way that manipulates a market. In any case, the tax was announced over a month ago. It is yet to be imposed. There is no justification for early imposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is only a case of government wanting money this year, the proper course was to introduce legislation immediately after the budget and pass it prior to the commencement of the financial year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why this bill is unlikely to be passed, or may well be contentious, is that its primary effect is to tax railroads and coastal shipping. In other words, it is a transfer of money from the states to the federal government. The minister made some comment about the fact that this will avoid people using this kind of light oil in trucks instead of diesel. It is quite easy for that to be taken into consideration and for exemptions to be made for railroads and coastal shipping. It can be made clear that it is not an exemption for road transport. That does not apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will greatly reduce any advantage that rail transport may have received. This will be to the detriment of any effort to stimulate the use of rail for freight and to undo the effect of government neglect of rail infrastructure. It will also be detrimental to efforts to meet our greenhouse targets in the transport sector. It will be detrimental economically. As many people in both Houses of this place have noted, the vast bulk of primary products&mdash;both mining and agricultural&mdash;are transported by rail. This massive tax rise will be passed on by states to primary industry, thus reducing its competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For shipping the impact is even more dramatic. Any ship can be deemed international by virtue of stopping at even one foreign port. If it is international it can buy all fuel free of tax. This applies to fuel oil and marine diesel. For coastal shipping, there is already a huge tax-imposed disadvantage to its competitiveness. This tax would greatly amplify it. What government is effectively doing is killing coastal shipping. I do not know why the government hates coastal shipping, but it clearly does. Maybe it thinks Stateships should all become international freight haulers. Who can tell?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are substantial indirect effects for primary industry&mdash;mainly export industry&mdash;in this tax. It will add substantially to their cost. Coastal shipping may be affected, but rail will not, and it will pass on the cost to farmers. Since light fuel oil is mainly used in trains and on ships, the main direct effect on the private ship sector is for marine tourist operators. Fishing will not be affected because of the diesel rebate already received for direct expenditure on fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Marine tourism operators face the situation that many tourism industries do, with substantial forward bookings. These bookings can be a year or more in advance and it is not practical to substantially increase price. For this reason, tourism industries are very badly affected by the immediate imposition of government generated cost increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, there is nothing either good or fair about this fuel tax. There is almost no reason to support it. I believe it would be unlikely to be supported in this place. This is why, in our estimation, the government is taking a backdoor of taxing without authority in this place. It is also a neat test for the practice in other contexts, such as we saw with wine or the sales tax hikes in 1993. It is tax by deception, it is tax by gazettes and it is certainly not a practice that any government should take deliberately in this place. </PARA>

The views taken by Senator Schacht in his response to Senator Margetts distort what Senator Margetts said. In her interjection, she said that there can be exemptions. From my understanding of what Senator Margetts said, she did not mean exemptions on trucks. What she referred to in her original question was the total unfairness in applying this sort of excise&mdash;an extra 26c a litre&mdash;to those small business people who operate tourist boats. That was the main thrust of the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to ask: why does it apply in the first place? You can argue that light fuel oil is more pollutant&mdash;as did Senator Collins by interjection&mdash;than diesel fuel, and no-one would disagree with that. But then it raises the question: why do you impose on a vessel that will never go down a main highway but will simply be used for tourist operations an increase in excise of 26c a litre? That is the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Margetts pointed out&mdash;this is where Senator Schacht has no understanding because he has no idea of what small business is about&mdash;the charges that are made by the tourist operators in many cases are paid in advance. They have no option. For one fairly big tourist operator in the Port Douglas area, it is going to cost an extra half a million dollars a year. If you want to calculate that per passenger, it is $2.50, which they cannot claim back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht mentioned that, if this were allowed to occur&mdash;and all that Senator Margetts said was, `Let us have an exemption for those specific areas'&mdash;this would cause rotting of the revenue. What he meant was rotting of the government revenue. It did not cross his little mind that he might be rotting the revenue of those private sector operators, the small business people. This was a shot out of the blue to them. It is grossly unfair that they should have to absorb that&mdash;of course, they cannot, so they must reduce their cost. Senator Macdonald said that the only way they can reduce their cost is to reduce the number of people employed by them, which adds to the ever increasing numbers available for work in the work force who have not got jobs. </PARA>

Yet Senator Cook gets up and says that it is the right of all Australians to belong to a superannuation fund. That is simply not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook referred to the comments made by a coalition of eight peak consumer and welfare organisations. None of the main organisations in that area are represented amongst those eight. They are the eight peak bodies, which include the Australian Council of Social Services, the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, the Australian Council on the Ageing, the Older Women's Network and the Women's Electoral Lobby. In the past all of those groups have been sympathetic to the government's actions. Without exception, they criticised the government's superannuation policy as unfair, inefficient, short-sighted and not cost-effective or equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jenny Mack, the director of the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations, speaks for the vast majority of Australians when she says, `We agree with the coalition approach; it provides a much fairer system on retirement savings.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook then went on and said how wonderful it was that this government has introduced employee contributions, phased in over a long period of time. In lieu of the tax cuts, the government is delivering the tax cuts and those tax cuts would be by way of superannuation contributions for the benefit of all Australians. If Senator Cook can find one self-funded retiree who is very happy to forgo tax cuts in order  that that money can contribute to a superannuation fund, I challenge him to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Self-funded retirees will not receive the promised tax cuts, the l-a-w tax cuts that they were promised prior to the last election. They will receive no benefit; as a matter of fact they are penalised. Self-funded retirees are also penalised in many other ways, such as with the tax-free threshold. Self-funded retirees have nothing to thank this government for because they are to receive absolutely nothing from the tax cuts that will be given in the form of superannuation contributions by this government, phased in over a long period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Cook gets up and talks about this government's superannuation policy and the wonderful things it is doing for Australians, we need to remember just how slow the government has been to react to those people who have been disadvantaged by this policy. I am referring to those people in the casual work force, those people with intermittent work patterns, invariably women. In past times women have certainly suffered from these policies far more than their male counterparts have, although I must say that the situation is changing and, with the casualisation of the work force, we are seeing many more males being placed in the situation women have been placed in for quite a period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook gets up in this chamber and tells us that everything in the garden is lovely with regard to the government's attitude towards superannuation and the great innovations that the government has made over its time in government, but he would do well to speak to those consumer and welfare organisations. In particular, I would suggest that he should go and speak with Jenny Mack. In the past she has supported many government policies but in this case she says that she agrees with the coalition approach because it provides a much fairer system for retirement savings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee on Public Works, I present report No. 10 of 1995 relating to the proposed Maralinga rehabilitation project, South Australia, and move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>Given recent events and proposed French nuclear tests in the South Pacific, the report which I have just tabled is of timely relevance. At some time scientists will have to undertake a clean-up of Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific. Between 1953 and 1963 Great Britain conducted several programs of nuclear warhead development trials on the Monte Bello Islands and at Maralinga and Emu, South Australia. Today this would not happen, but at that time it was thought there would be no long term damage&mdash;how wrong this has proven to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maralinga is 270 kilometres north-west of Ceduna; Emu a further 190 kilometres north-east of Maralinga. Detonations of nine nuclear weapons and hundreds of minor trials were carried out, which dispersed radioactive materials. Former test sites are contaminated to various levels with plutonium and other artificially produced isotopes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1969 Britain undertook a program of clean-up works called Operation Brumby. The 1985 royal commission into British nuclear tests in Australia concluded that the clean-up was inadequate, based on wrong assumptions and left the area in a more difficult state for any further clean-up. Again, mistakes were made that now have to be rectified. It will be a costly exercise for the Australian taxpayer. The royal commission recommended that action should be taken to reduce radioactive contamination to a level suitable for unrestricted habitation by the traditional Aboriginal owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of rehabilitation options and comparative costs was developed by a technical advisory group. The preferred option, option 6(c), was used by the government as the basis of negotiations with Great Britain for a substantial contribution to the cost of rehabilitation works. An agreement was reached in December 1993 for an ex gratia payment of #20 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a very important part of its inquiry, the committee inspected the former test sites on the Monte Bello Islands off the coast of Western Australia as well as the Maralinga test and trials areas. With us on our inspections were experts from Australia and Britain who had been involved in radioactive decontamination worldwide. We also had the benefit of advice from Mr Bruce Church, the former assistant manager of environment, safety and health on a Nevada test site and currently consultant to the US government on radioactive decontamination matters. To the fullest extent possible, we were well equipped in our deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found that there is a need for remedial action to be undertaken at Maralinga to reduce the radiological hazards at the test sites sufficiently to enable Aboriginal traditional land use and transit of the test site area; to reduce and possibly eliminate the need for control and surveillance of the sites; and to remove potential Commonwealth liabilities arising from site contamination. It was quite interesting that in some areas we were able to walk around and pick up pieces of used uranium. We were told that it was not radioactive. We also found quite large areas contaminated with plutonium that were radioactive and were dangerous if inhaled. We were also told that if some specks of plutonium, which may be inhaled in dust, were ingested into lungs, it may cause cancer in about 30 years. That situation existed on some of these sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Operation Brumby, they moved in with disc ploughs and tractors and ploughed up the whole lot up in an effort to retain the dust from the fallout of plutonium. All it did was bury it and still leave the problem there. As the dust comes through and people move through, it makes the likelihood of people ingesting small specks of plutonium a major danger. The top few inches of soil will be scraped off and buried. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $104.4 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A notable feature of the rehabilitation will involve subjecting the burial pits at Taranaki to in situ vitrification. The contents of the pits will be subject to enormous quantities of electricity, which will literally melt the soil and the contents and fuse them into something resembling glass. We saw samples of this where it had been done in the US. This is new technology. It is proposed to conduct trials before the decision to go ahead is made. The committee has therefore recommended that an independent audit of the trials of material containing plutonium should be undertaken by experts not associated with this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the results of the review indicate that the in situ vitrification process provides encapsulation and the mixing of material to prescribed standards, the process can be extended to the full-scale treatment of burial pits at Taranaki. If the results of the in situ vitrification trials are inconclusive or do not provide results to prescribed standards, the further direction of the project should be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plutonium contaminated soil at Taranaki, Wewak and two other former trial sites will be disposed of in deep trenches adjacent to the contaminated areas. We were assured that numerous other pits contained only nominally contaminated debris and soil. These pits will be treated by a variety of methods ranging from re-contouring to total exhumation, the latter requiring full health physics control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remainder of the pits are to be treated to the extent of tidying up the surface by the removal and re-burial of exposed debris or compaction of the debris and restoration of the area. Soil importation will be required at some pits to restore the surface to its natural level. The project involved is expensive, but we cannot walk away; we have to try to restore the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some discussion about the best way of undertaking the remediation works. A number of groups, such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, submitted that it might be more appropriate if all the contaminated soil and other rubbish was stored above ground. However, the committee concluded that, based on the evidence, the burial of contaminated soil and other debris appears to be the more appropriate solution compared with above-ground storage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project will require a very strict regime of measures designed to protect the workers undertaking the rehabilitation. The report describes in some detail these measures. The committee has concluded that, based on the evidence presented, these measures appear to be adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maralinga is an example to the world that tests carried out for whatever reason have a cost to health. Financially, the taxpayer will eventually have to pay. It is a lesson from which others can learn. We are not experts, but we have thought long and hard about this project. We received advice from experts in Australia and overseas. We inspected the sites and, on the basis of the evidence, have recommended that the proposed rehabilitation should proceed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speeches read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bills will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects to give effect to certain announcements in the 1995-96 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Company tax rate change</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1995 will increase the general rate of company tax from 33 per cent to 36 per cent for taxable income of the 1995-96 and subsequent income years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increased rate will apply to most companies, including non-resident companies, that are taxable in Australia. The new rate will also apply to public trading trusts, corporate unit trusts and limited partnerships that are taxed as companies. The non-statutory fund income of nonmutual life assurance companies will also be subject to tax at the increased rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change in the rate of tax will not apply to certain classes of companies or incomes that are taxed at special rates of tax. The new tax rate will not apply to the statutory fund income or the superannuation business of life assurance companies or to pooled development fund income. It will also not apply to the trustees of superannuation funds, approved deposit funds or pooled superannuation trusts or to registered organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concessional tax rates that apply to recognised credit unions for the income years up to and including 1996-97 are also not affected by the rate change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change in the company tax rate will affect the operation of the franking accounts of companies. Changes to deal with the franking accounts matters will be provided for in an amendment bill to be introduced later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change in the company tax rate will provide revenue gains in the order of $320 million in 1995-96, $1,570 million in 1996-97, $940 million in 1997-98 and $1,140 million in 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Taxation of friendly societies and other registered organisations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1995-96 budget the government announced a review of the taxing arrangements that apply to the life insurance business of friendly societies and life assurance companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is concerned that the review not interfere with the conduct of life insurance business. Accordingly the trustee rates that applied during the 1994-95 income year to the eligible insurance business of life assurance companies (39 per cent) and friendly societies and other registered organisations (33 per cent) will be maintained until the 1997-98 year of income while the review is undertaken. The tax rates that apply to the life insurance business of life assurance companies and friendly societies will be aligned as an outcome of the review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, amendments in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill will freeze the rate of tax imposed on the eligible insurance business of friendly societies and other registered organisations at 33 per cent for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 years of income. The rebate applying to taxable bonuses paid on life insurance policies issued by friendly societies will increase to 3 from I July 1995 as scheduled and will be maintained at that level for the year beginning I July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost to the revenue of the measures is expected to be $11 million in 1995-96, $45 million in 1996-97 and $22 million in 1997-98. There is expected to be a revenue gain of $4 million in 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tax-advantaged computer programs</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sales tax law contains a concession for goods containing computer programs on reprogrammable microchips. The concession was introduced in September 1992 through a Senate amendment. In effect, the exemption removed from the taxable value of goods the value of any computer program embodied in a re-programmable microchip. This meant that a tax benefit could be obtained merely by putting computer programs on re-programmable microchips instead of non-re-programmable chips The government strongly opposed the introduction of this measure, reflecting the range of drawbacks with it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exemption has allowed some taxpayers to claim large reductions in their sales tax liability, and, overall, it is estimated to he costing the Budget some $150 million per annum. Greater losses are anticipated as manufacturers switch to tax advantaged computer programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from the fiscal costs, the exemption has caused a range of other problems, including the misallocation of resources by manufacturers using the more expensive re-programmable microchips solely to get a tax exemption. There have been major problems for taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office in assessing the value of tax-advantaged computer programs. These have resulted in some manufacturers gaining unfair competitive advantages and, given the difficulties with valuing foreign sourced computer programs, it is likely that some Australian manufacturers have been disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 is being amended to remove the concession in respect of computer programs contained on non-permanent microchips. This will arrest the significant loss of sales tax revenue arising from the imprecise nature of the exemption, remove anomalies that result in difficulties for taxpayers and promote equity in the market place. The treatment of computer programs will be restored to what it was before the introduction of the 1992 amendment. There will continue to be a reduction in taxable value for certain programs on microchips in cartridges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will take effect from budget night. The gain to revenue from the measures is likely to be $10 million for 1994-95, $150 million for 1995-96, $160 million for 1996-97 $170 million for 1997-98 and $185 million for 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sales tax refunds</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sales tax law provides that refunds of sales tax can only be obtained where conditions in the sales tax law are satisfied. These measures provide a level of certainty for both taxpayers and the government in the treatment of claims for overpaid tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, common law court challenges are seeking to bypass the specified conditions and extend the refund periods beyond the three year limit in the sales tax law. If successful, these challenges could result in `windfall' gains to taxpayers of millions of dollars in cases where the tax was not borne by the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Measures in these bills will prevent the extension of the refund period and the possibility of windfalls for certain taxpayers. These measures will take effect from budget night. It has not been possible to quantify the financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Consequential changes</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995 also makes changes consequential on the increase in the rate of sales tax applying to non-luxury passenger motor vehicles and on the increase in the company tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Provisional Tax Uplift Factor</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill amends the definition of provisional tax uplift factor so that the factor is 8 per cent for the 1995-96 year of income and 10 per cent for the later years of income unless the Parliament provides otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full details of the amendments in these bills are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bills will modify the sales tax law to give effect to certain announcements in the 1995-96 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Passenger motor vehicles</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bills will increase the rate of sales tax applying to non-luxury passenger motor vehicles from 16 per cent to 21 per cent. The rate of sales tax applying to the portion of the value of luxury passenger motor vehicles below the luxury threshold will also be increased in line with the rate for non-luxury passenger motor vehicles. These changes will take effect from Budget night.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sales tax applying to non-luxury passenger motor vehicles was reduced from the general rate as an anti-cyclical measure in the 1992 One Nation Statement. Strong growth in the economy has removed any need for the concessional rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gain to revenue of these measures is likely to be $18 million for 1994-95, $330 million for 1995-96, $355 million for 1996-97, $380 million for 1997-98 and $405 million for 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Safes, musical instruments and ornaments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bills make clear that safes, musical instruments including pianos and other keyboards and ornaments in the nature of bric-a-brac are not entitled to the concessional rate of sales tax applicable to household furniture. These changes will take effect from Budget night.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The modifications are necessary following recent disputes where taxpayers have claimed that these goods, which have long been considered taxable at the general rate, should be treated as furniture and therefore subject to the concessional rate of 11 per cent. The Government considers it necessary to legislate to ensure that these goods continue to be taxed at the general rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These modifications will prevent the potential for revenue leakage rather than directly increasing revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Model aircraft</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sales tax law provides an exemption from sales tax for aircraft. A recent court decision has resulted in this exemption being extended to model aircraft capable of flight. This is at odds with the longstanding policy on the treatment of model aircraft. The bills will ensure that all model aircraft are again taxed at the general rate of sales tax, along with other toys. This modification will take effect from Budget night. It has not been possible to quantify the gain to the revenue for this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Scaffolding components, wall and floor tiles, shelving systems</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bills will reverse the effect of recent court decisions, which have expanded the scope of sales tax exemptions for building materials beyond what was originally intended, with regard to scaffolding components, wall and floor safes and shelving systems. That is, the bills will ensure that these goods, which had long been accepted as being subject to sales tax, will not be eligible for sales tax exemptions. These changes will take effect from Budget night. These modifications will prevent the potential for revenue leakage rather than directly increasing revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Building materials</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bills will make certain categories of currently exempt building materials taxable at the concessional rate, which will be 12 per cent when the modification comes into effect on 1 July 1995. This measure will apply the 12 per cent rate to a wide range of building materials used in the completion of buildings, including goods such as wall and floor tiles, plaster, taps and nozzles, timber floor coverings, paints, putties, fillers, wallpaper, builders hardware and some items of prefabricated joinery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gain to the revenue of the measures is likely to be $215 million for 1995-96, $245 million for 1996-97, $265 million for 1997-98 and $290 million for 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recycled paper</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certain goods made from recycled paper are exempt from sales tax provided the goods are made entirely from recycled paper. The Government considers that this sales tax exemption is inefficient and likely to impede efficient industry development. The bills therefore remove the sales tax exemption for goods made from recycled paper. This modification will take effect from 1 November 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gain to revenue of these measures is likely to be $7 million for 1995-96, $13 million for 1996-97, $14 million for 1997-98 and $15 million for 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Motor vehicle for certain disabled persons</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing sales tax law exempts motor vehicles (up to the luxury threshold) for certain disabled people for travel to and from gainful employment. The exemption is available to persons who have a certificate from the Secretary of the Department of Human Services and Health certifying that they have lost the use of one or both of their legs to such an extent that they are unable to use public transport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will extend the scope of the exemption so that it will be available to persons who have lost the use of any limb to such an extent that they are unable to use public transport. This will cover persons who have lost the use of their arms, as well as persons who have lost the use of their legs.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 to reflect amendments made to the Social Security Act 1991 introduced last year or currently before the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 1 January 1995 the Government introduced the Youth Training Initiative as part of Working Nation. Under the Youth Training Initiative, young unemployed people under 18 now have access to case management, labour market programs and a new income support scheme, the Youth Training Allowance, which will over time completely replace Job Search Allowance for young unemployed people under 18.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Youth Training Allowance aligns benefits for unemployed young people more closely with assistance available under AUSTUDY, particularly in relation to the parental means test and the away from home rate. In other respects, however, the general conditions remain the same as for Job Search Allowance. The policy responsibility for Youth Training Allowance has been allocated to the Department of Employment, Education and Training to reflect the greater emphasis on integrating income support into a process leading to employment or employment-related outcomes. However, the delivery of the Youth Training Allowance is similar to payment of Job Search Allowance with the Department of Social Security being the paying agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that the legislation for the Youth Training Allowance and the Job Search Allowance have the same provisions in areas where a common approach is intended. The present bill seeks to amend the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 to incorporate recent and pending amendments to the Social Security Act 1991. These comprise changes made last year to the Social Security Act 1991 and changes proposed by two bills now before the Parliament, the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 1 of this bill relates to the waiting period for clients who have substantial liquid assets. This amendment changes the treatment of liquid assets to allow one-off payments of non-house related debts and proceeds of the sale of the person's home that will be applied to the purchase of another home to be deducted from a person's liquid assets. Disregarding these amounts would make the application of the liquid assets test fairer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 2 of the bill applies to youth training allowance clients, or their partners, who receive periodic compensation payments. The amendments modify the compensation provisions in line with the new income test introduced in the Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 3 of the bill ensures that two or more lump sum compensation payments made in respect of one disease, injury or condition sustained in one compensable event are treated as one lump sum compensation payment for the purposes of the compensation recovery provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 4 of the bill will make sure that the often time-consuming process of assessing qualification can be bypassed if the person's prospective payment would have been precluded in any event by the application of the compensation recovery provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of that Schedule would also ensure that payments of certain types of pensions, benefits or allowances which were paid to a person's partner under the Social Security Act 1991, but which have been superseded by other types of pensions, benefits and allowances, can be recovered under the compensation recovery provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 4 would also simplify the compensation recovery rules in sections 229 and 233 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current legislation, there is a clear distinction between qualification for and payability of Youth Training Allowance. In general, Youth Training Allowance is no longer payable after a person loses qualification for it. However, the existing debt recovery provisions do not make this clear. Schedule 5 of the bill makes changes to section 261 of the act, one of the main debt creation provisions in the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. (Parts of a similar provision in the Social Security Act 1991, section 1223, has, in its current form, proved difficult to administer.) Reliance on the concept of payability in the creation of debts has been replaced by reference to receipt of payments. Section 261 has been recast in order to make it more readily understood and easier to apply. There are related amendments in Schedule 6.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments made by Schedule 6 will firstly simplify the cancellation and debt creation provisions of the act by providing that once a client loses his or her qualification for Youth Training Allowance, any further overpayments are recoverable, except as provided for by the automatic termination provisions where the recipient complies with his/her notification qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 6 will also create a period of grace in relation to rate reductions for a person who is receiving Youth Training Allowance. Where a change of circumstances occurs and DSS is properly notified, Youth Training Allowance continues to be payable to the person, without reduction, until the end of the notification period and then becomes payable at the reduced rate. This is consistent with an amendment introduced in the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments contained in Schedule 6 will also ensure that where a person with an earnings credit balance fails to notify income from employment that would operate to reduce his or her rate of Youth Training Allowance, the rate is to be reduced from the first day of the period in which the person's income exceeds the free area (after taking into account any earnings balance). It will also ensure consistency with other provisions that provide for rate reduction from the day after the change occurred, rather than from the following payday. This amendment is in line with provisions contained in the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current provisions allow the Secretary to disclose client information to the Secretary of another Department of the Commonwealth or to the head of an authority of the Commonwealth for the purposes of that Department or authority. Schedule 7 of the bill removes the provision under the act preventing the Secretary from delegating the disclosure power so that staff of the Department will be able to perform the disclosure function in place of the Secretary and will allow the Secretary to disclose information not only to a Secretary of a Commonwealth Department of head of a Commonwealth authority, but also to an officer of that Department or authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been confusion about whether or not a decision made personally by the Minister in relation to determining an exemption from the deeming provisions, that is, that loans or classes of low interest loans are not subject to an assumed loan rate, is a reviewable decision. Schedule 8 of the bill clarifies that such a decision is not subject to review, either internally or by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 9 of the bill clarifies that the Secretary may waive a part, not merely the whole, of the waiting or deferment period that occurs after a client starts a vocational training course. In addition, the bill provides that a client undertaking post-secondary courses will not need to serve an education leavers waiting period to the extent that they have already served it in a 12 month period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current rules allow payment of Youth Training Allowance to continue for up to 3 weeks after a person commences an AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY approved course of longer than 6 months' duration pending determination of the person's claim for a student assistance payment. Schedule 10 of the bill allows for the payment to continue for the full 3 weeks and for the provision to apply regardless of the duration of the course. It also provides for relief from the activity test in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the factors taken into account in working out the effect of the parental means test on the rate of Youth Training Allowance is the valuation of fringe benefits. One of the five types of fringe benefits valued under the act is the loan benefit. If an employer makes a loan to an employee it may be regarded as a loan fringe benefit. Schedule 11 of the bill introduces a mechanism for setting interest rates based on current market rates in order to assess the value of a loan fringe benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 11 would also remove a technical difficulty which has been discovered in the application of the loan fringe benefit provisions of the parental income test. That test is relevant to calculating the rate at which a person receives youth training allowance. For these provisions to operate properly a yearly notional interest rate should have been prescribed by regulation. No regulation was made. If a regulation had been made the rates would have been the same as the rates inserted by Schedule 11. The need for a regulation in the future has been removed by the other amendments to be made by Schedule 11. Any possible anomalies in the manner in which the loan fringe benefit provisions have been currently applied are to be removed by these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are very few young people affected by the loan fringe benefit provisions of the parental income test. If any of them received youth training allowance at a higher rate than is provided for by these amendments, no repayment will be required. If any of them would have been entitled to a higher rate, but did not receive it, the amendments permit any shortfall to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act enables the Secretary to require a person to provide a statement to the Department about a matter that might affect payment of Youth Training Allowance to the person. Where a person complies and, as a result, payment is affected, the general rate increase, reduction or cancellation provisions may apply. Schedule 12 of the bill provides that, in these circumstances, the date of effect of the determination to vary, cancel or suspend payment is the day of the event or change in circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Secretary is able to decide if a person has failed to enter into an activity agreement where the person has been required to enter into such an agreement. Part 1 of Schedule 13 clarifies that a person can be taken to have failed to negotiate an activity agreement if the Secretary is satisfied that the person is unreasonably delaying entering into the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2 of Schedule 13 will enable the Secretary to require a recipient of youth training allowance to attend a place nominated by the Secretary for a particular purpose; for example, to attend a course information session at a place other than a Department of Social Security or Commonwealth Employment Service office. It will also provide that a person will be taken to have been notified of this requirement if the notice is sent, in addition to other existing methods of notification, to the person's last known post office box.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 3 of Schedule 13 provides that only clients who have been approved to participate in labour market programs approved by the Secretary will be entitled to the training supplement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 4 of Schedule 13 provides that the Secretary can send notices to a person's last known postal address. Currently the provision covers sending a notice only to a physical address.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will have no or negligible financial impact.</PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, Local Government is close to the communities it services and has a wide range of representational, executive and community service functions which impact on the quality of life of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local Government plays an important role in achieving a range of national priorities in the areas of micro-economic reform, urban reform, regional economic development, environment and social justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of the importance of Local Government, the Commonwealth currently provides in excess of $1 billion in grants to Local Government. These grants are untied, allowing them to be spent by individual local councils in accordance with the priorities they determine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill provides for the continuation of these untied grants to local councils and for continuation of their annual escalation formula.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also includes important reforms in relation to the transparency and accountability for these grants, including outcomes achieved by local governing bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should emphasise that the bill does not impose conditions on the way in which local governing bodies can spend their grants. Rather it requires that information on the distribution of Commonwealth grants and the performance of recipient local governing bodies be available for scrutiny by this Parliament and the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for these reforms arises out of studies undertaken as part of the Australian Urban and Regional Development Review and extensive consultation and discussion with State Governments, the Australian and State Local Government Associations and individual local governing bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Untied Commonwealth funding to Local Government has been provided under various acts since 1974. Although the actual arrangements have been subject to various amendments since that time, all Commonwealth Governments, no matter what their political persuasion, have recognised its importance to Local Government and agreed to the funding continuing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing act there are two components to the untied funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is a general grant component which represents around two thirds of the total financial assistance grants. This funding is allocated between the States and the Northern Territory on a per capita basis with the intra-state distribution being undertaken primarily on a horizontal equalisation basis; that is, the funding is provided on a basis that ensures that each local governing body in the State or Territory is able to function by reasonable effort, at a standard not lower than the average standard of other local governing bodies in the State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second component, making up the remaining untied funding, relates to identified local road funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to 1991, funding for local roads was delivered under tied arrangements. In 1991, this Government amended the existing Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 to give effect to the 1990 Special Premiers' Conference decision to untie local roads funds and pay these via general purpose grants. These funds are allocated amongst the States/Territory on an historical funding basis with intra-state distribution being on a roads needs basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill maintains all these features of the existing act, but removes the provision in the current act  which would see local road funds being absorbed into the general grants with effect from 1995/96. The bill gives effect to the Premiers' Conference decision of 11 April 1995 to continue to distribute local road funding on the basis of historical shares rather than having them absorbed into local government general grants and distributed on a per capita basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Absorption of local road funding into the general grants would result in a change in distribution amongst States resulting in significant funding reductions to Western Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and Queensland and would also lead to changes in the  intra-state distribution of these funds in all States which would disadvantage rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continued separate identification of local road funds has had strong support from local governments and from all State Local Government Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Escalation of  local government funding is determined by the Treasurer, in consultation with the responsible Minister, having regard to the level of assistance grants and special revenue assistance paid to the States each year. This linkage means that the escalation factor for local government financial assistance grants takes account of inflation and population growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the development of national principles, applicable to all States and the Northern Territory, governing the intra-state distribution of grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National principles, in lieu of bilateral principles, provide a more nationally consistent and transparent basis for allocating funds to local governing bodies. Application of common principles should ensure, subject to the particular methodologies of the State and Territory Grants Commissions, that similar councils receive similar grants, at least in relative terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National principles will be determined after consultations with the States and Territories and the Australian Local Government Association, with a view to reaching a common view on their content. Where there are disagreements the Commonwealth has undertaken to seek the views of the Local Government Ministers' Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allocations among local governing bodies will continue to be made by Local Government Grants Commissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains major enhancements to the accountability arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister will be required to present an annual national report to Parliament, replacing the current requirement which only requires presentation of the various State/Territory recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new national report will include information on the grants to individual councils and categories of councils. It will report on State Grants Commission methodologies in relation to both equalisation and local roads grants, on achievement of horizontal equalisation amongst councils and on council efficiency and effectiveness. The report will also provide information on the operation of the act in relation to service delivery to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure that honourable Senators will welcome the opportunity to be kept informed about the funds  paid to local governments in their electorates,  and recognise that local government efficiency and effectiveness and service delivery to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are important and legitimate national priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reporting on services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities will not be a simple task. The Commonwealth does not hold most of the information and we will need to work hard and cooperatively to ensure data are comparable and meaningful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard the Commonwealth is pleased to note that Local Government shares the national objective of ensuring that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have equitable access to services. The Commonwealth particularly welcomes the resolutions of the Local Government Ministers' Conference (including the Australian Local Government Association) in April this year concerning services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will consult widely and fully with Local Government and States in developing data.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the act to be reviewed prior to 30 June 2001 and establishes particular issues that such a review must examine. The aim is to ensure the act is delivering the intended reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing this bill I have also taken the opportunity to address a number of administrative matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The moneys under this bill are appropriated to the Department of Housing and Regional Development and paid by that Department to the States. This replaces the current provision under which the Treasury makes the payments and is in line with the principle that the Department administering the legislation should look after the funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payments to the Australian Capital Territory are included for the first time in line with the requirement to treat the act in the same manner as all other States and the Northern Territory. Previous local government funding to the act was by way of an analogous payment estimated using the same factors as were applicable to other States. This change does not affect the grant outcomes for the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for an earlier announcement of the estimated funding levels for the coming financial year. This has been done to facilitate announcement of funding in a May, rather than August Budget. The change responds to requests from some States for an earlier announcement to allow for individual council distributions to be included in council rate setting assessments for the coming year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to allow for early announcement, an estimated entitlement for local government funding is determined at the time of the Commonwealth Budget based on the estimated growth in the State general purpose funding. Once estimates have been produced for budget purposes and conveyed to State governments, no further adjustments will occur until the year following the year of payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adjustments of these estimates would be done when providing estimates for the next year's Budget with the final entitlement being established when the last payment is determined for State general payments, that is, by the end of June in any year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This change has necessitated altering the formulas included in the bill but the final funding to local government is still the same as it would have been under the current legislation. The advantage is that local government will know much earlier the level of funding they can expect for the coming year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transitional provisions are included to ensure that the changes to the new legislation will create as little disruption as possible to council distributions. Distributions for 1995/96 will occur as if the current legislation was still in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides that the Minister may determine, if necessary and on a State by State basis, phase-in arrangements to take account of the impact on councils of the new national principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to honourable Senators.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK INDUSTRY BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Meat and Live-stock Industry Bill 1995 and associated bills is to provide a statutory framework that will take the meat and livestock industry towards the next decade and beyond on a much stronger, coherent and commercially driven basis. The new arrangements provide industry with much greater responsibility for its own affairs, moves it towards a less government regulated environment and with statutory structures that are appropriate to the future commercial and consumer challenges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current legislation has been in place since 1984 and has been successful in transforming industry from a production driven system to one which pays closer attention to consumer requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the assistance of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) and the Meat Research Corporation (MRC), industry has: put in place the means to convey market signals back to producers and computer driven marketing technology; focused on the expanding opportunities that have prevailed in north Asia; expanded the lot feed cattle industry to produce to exacting export market specifications; and recognised the importance of quality assurance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the pace of change has been slow and there is still considerable way to go in addressing increasing consumer expectations on food safety, becoming more cost competitive in meat processing and developing and implementing quality assurance systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry must take the leadership role on these issues and be responsible for the outcomes. Commercial judgment and responsibility is needed to meet the competitive challenges that lie ahead. I am confident that industry has the necessary leadership capability and that the new structures in this legislation will play an appropriate part in driving change and development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There should be no commercial role, and I stress commercial role, for government in future arrangements. The role for government agencies is to facilitate industry development and to ensure the services it provides are cost effective and responsive to industry needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me be clear here, that this new direction in no way diminishes the important and active role which federal and state governments must play in ensuring health safety for consumers both here in Australia and in our overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation is therefore necessary to assist industry move forward to its goal of becoming more internationally competitive and better able to respond to the more exacting consumer requirements now being demanded throughout the world. The new structure will better equip industry to make decisions and develop strategies that will allow it to take advantage of the expanded opportunities following the successfully conclusion to the Uruguay GATT round.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new structural arrangements also assist industry through strategic planning to position itself better for the increased competition that is expected to come from foot and mouth free South American suppliers in the not too distant future. Domestic issues such as quality assurance, food safety and brand promotion will also benefit from a strategic approach under the new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new statutory arrangements have resulted from extensive consultation with industry during and following the industry commission inquiry into meat processing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the industry commission inquiry, a consultative process undertaken by the former chairman of the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council (AMLIPC), Mr Bob McCarthy, generated a large measure of consensus within the industry on the need for reform as well as momentum and commitment to change throughout the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements developed from the consultations and now embodied in the legislation, have the full support of the key levy paying sectors of industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As implied earlier, the principle behind the reforms is to phase the government out of the statutory arrangements, through a staged approach of transferring greater responsibility for industry decision making to the industry itself, and eventually moving to a non-statutory environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation builds on the meat and livestock industry reforms introduced by the government in 1984, which sought to transfer the industry policy development function from the AMLC to the industry, through the AMLIPC. The AMLC and MRC were intended to concentrate on program development and delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For various reasons, this structure has not delivered as intended. The AMLIPC has not had industry support or ownership and the AMLIPC was perceived as a wing of government. Issues were not addressed on a strategic and continuing policy development basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, the AMLC has continued to be the focal point of industry policy development, which has lead to a general feeling of impotence within the industry on their ability to control their own destiny. Industry decisions have been perceived to have been made on a reactive basis, rather than within the framework of a coherent strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation aims to overcome these shortcomings by restructuring the policy body and giving it teeth. The new Meat Industry Council (MIC) has the clear responsibility for developing the vision and strategic directions for the industry and for formulating broad industry policy. The AMLC and MRC will be required to develop their corporate plans within the strategic framework developed by the MIC, and have the corporate plans approved by the MIC before seeking the minister's approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly the MIC will be funded from a separate component of the industry levies and charges but this will not involve any levy increase on industry under current levy arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The MIC will operated with a small staff and budget and staff will be managed by a highly qualified chief executive officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The MIC will be responsible for:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">developing the vision and strategic directions for the industry;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">formulating broad industry policy;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">approving the strategic plans of the AMLC and MRC;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">developing motions to be put to industry annual general meetings and special general meetings to provide funding for the MIC, the AMLC and MRC;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">evaluating the performance of industry programs;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">developing proposals for industry self-regulation; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">developing a united industry approach to issues affecting the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation provides a sunset to the statutory structures at 30 June 1998, with a review by government and industry to commence no later than 1 July 1997. This has a two-fold purpose: to allow a staged management of the evolution of the arrangements, in light of concerns that the industry may need to develop further professionalism in some areas before taking on full responsibility; and to provide an incentive to ensure industry makes the MIC work, and to provide some certainty of movement towards the desired end-point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An interim council, operating under the existing AMLIPC legislation, has already met under chairman designate Robin Bligh and commenced the important task of developing the council's agenda and a strategic plan for the future. It has been very important that the council commence its operations on an interim basis before legislation is enacted to ensure that the momentum for change is not lost and that strategic planning commence to guide the corporations' activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interim MIC mirrors the legislation and consists of industry leaders nominated by the industry organisations as agreed with the peak industry levy paying bodies. In addition to the twelve producers, processors and exporters nominated by the Cattle Council of Australia, Sheepmeats Council of Australia, Australian Meat Council and Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia, have been added a representative of the Australian Lot Feeders' Association, the Australian Livestock Exporters' Association, the Australian Supermarket Institute Limited, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and a government member.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional organisations reflect their importance in the meat and livestock industry and they will no doubt add to the quality of the decision making by that body. Although the chairpersons of the AMLC and MRC will not be members of the MIC, as appropriate, they can be invited to attend council meetings as observers. The industry bodies involved will be called upon shortly to confirm or amend their nominations to be appointed formally to the MIC by the Minister Senator Collins.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The composition of the MIC is quite large but this provides industry `ownership' and the confidence that their views are being represented in the important strategic planning and policy developments for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the MIC will be part-time and appointed for up to three years at a time, although organisations may request replacement of one or more of their representatives at any time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no provision for deputies of members to ensure that continuity is given importance and that members and organisations take their responsibilities seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation also provides for remuneration of members of the MIC&mdash;not to cover loss of income specifically but to further encourage members' commitment to the council. Such remuneration will be determined by the remuneration tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the MIC to work effectively there must be a clear acceptance by industry organisations and all members of council of their leadership role for the wider industry and not specific sectoral interests. It is also very important for representatives of council being able to take decisions for industry with authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government expects that the MIC will not be involved in the day-to-day program management of the corporations. Although the MIC will have a broad control over the AMLC and MRC budgets, it will not have a mandate to involve itself in program delivery, nor will it be involved in a line-by-line examination of the corporations' budgets. The council will set the strategic directions against which programs will be developed, approve the strategic plans of the corporations and recommend appropriate levy rates to fund those plans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The MIC is tasked with working with the government and industry to develop the next steps to move to a non-statutory environment, developing directions for industry self-regulation and assisting the AMLC to develop timetables for the commercialisation of programs, which will be best managed in a commercial environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The council has an important role in the evaluation of industry programs managed by the corporations. Given the difficulties involved in quantifying the benefits of marketing and research activities, and in circumstances where there is little information available to levy payers and government to judge the performance of the AMLC and MRC, it will be an important role for the council to provide independent information to levy payers on the effectiveness of programs against predetermined performance criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such evaluation measures should be objective indicators which are monitored and reported on a regular basis. Council can also provide detailed case studies on the costs and benefits of specific programs of each organisation&mdash;or monitor the progress of the AMLC and MRC in fulfilling predetermined deadlines such as the commercialisation of programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall an evaluation role will increase the transparency of the AMLC's and MRC's operations as well as placing pressure on both organisations to continually improve performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The MIC will be responsible for providing funding to the peak industry councils for consultations with the AMLC and MRC, unlike the present arrangement, where the corporations provide such funding. It is appropriate that in determining the overall levels of funding, that industry also be responsible for determining consultation funding. However, the MIC and recipient bodies will be required to meet the government's guidelines concerning consultation funding and the recipient bodies will also be required to provide the minister with audited financial statements in relation to the funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry has been concerned for some time about the cost and substance of annual general meetings (AGMs) of the corporations. It is however necessary for the purposes of accountability to both the government and levy payers that AGMs continue. In the corporate world there is direct accountability to shareholders by private companies through an AGM process. As there will now be a staged move towards a non-statutory environment, it is important that such accountability mechanisms are not removed which would subsequently need to be reintroduced in a corporate environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the legislation a new approach will take place at future AGMs. The MIC will be required to convene an annual industry conference, open to all registered levy and charge payers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it will be a `forward looking' process and will enable industry to consider the broad strategic directions for industry and provide a forum for discussion of important industry issues, unlike the current AGMs which by their very nature are retrospective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AGMs will, however, be a smaller subset of the conference. The MIC will convene an industry annual general meeting (AGM) of the three statutory bodies to formally present their annual reports, vote on any levy and charge motions put forward by the council, and vote on any no confidence motions put forward by levy and charge payers. This is necessary to provide accountability to the wider industry shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All levy motions will be put forward by the council. Under the current arrangements the AMLC and MRC put forward their own motions to separate annual general meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a provision for the MIC to convene a special general meeting to consider a change in levy rates for the MIC, AMLC and MRC to meet special circumstances. This is not intended to be a regularly used power, but should be a safeguard to allow the industry to raise funds quickly to deal with an urgent industry management problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The MIC will also be required to produce an annual report to parliament which must include the results of evaluations undertaken of AMLC and MRC programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the industry consultations there has been clear industry support for the thrust of the IC recommendations dealing with the commercialisation of some AMLC programs. Industry had in mind particularly the Computer Assisted Livestock Marketing (CALM) and Aus-meat programs, but there may be other programs which industry might determine can better operate in a commercial environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new legislation assists with the commercialisation of schemes such as the CALM program and Aus-meat, (a product description and quality assurance program) under the strategic guidance of the MIC. The legislation allows AMLC, in cooperation with another organisation, to facilitate the marketing of goods other than meat and livestock. This will allow other species to participate in CALM to improve its commercial viability and allow AMLC to entice private equity into this program. However, eligible schemes will need to be prescribed, and details of the scope of their operations will need to be set out in the AMLC's corporate plan, which requires ministerial approval and the agreement of the MIC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMLC's legislation will also be extended to cover by-products of the meat and livestock industry. This is a power which the MRC already has under its legislation. Given the need for industry to become more competitive, it is important that every opportunity be taken by industry to add value. In this regard, it will be up to the MIC to develop a strategy for adding value in the by-products and co-products areas, where there is considerable scope for further improvement. The legislation provides the MIC with the option, if it so chooses, of using the AMLC, as well as the MRC, as the program delivery mechanism under any agreed industry strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are some functions and powers which are removed from the AMLC legislation and these include:  the funding of industry bodies for consultation purposes, which will be transferred to the MIC as mentioned earlier; the power to trade in meat and livestock; and the power to set conditions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on the shipping of meat and livestock from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry supports the removal of AMLC shipping and trading powers. These provisions are against the thrust of government's deregulatory reform, are not currently in use or likely to be used in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The MIC will examine the AMLC licensing powers and the implications for Aus-meat and quota controls. In the interim, the AMLC will continue to administer export quota schemes where they become necessary on the basis determined by the MIC under the strategic planning process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMLC legislation is being amended to ensure that the MIC has a full range of options that it can consider when developing the policy framework for quota administration. The legislation includes provisions that will permit the allocation of quota free of charge or by auction, sale by tender or private sale. It is important that the MIC is not constrained in its analysis of options by legislation that predicates only one option&mdash;and that is the status quo of allocation of quota free of charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Board membership for both the AMLC and MRC will be reduced from eleven to seven members to reflect their more sharply focused program management role. The boards will consist of: a chairperson, chosen and appointed by the minister; a managing director, chosen and appointed by the corporation; a government member, chosen and appointed by the minister; and four other members, appointed by the minister from a list provided by the selection committee, and nominated against a set of skills-based selection criteria. All members, apart from the managing director, will be part-time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The membership of the AMLC and MRC (except the chairs and managing directors) are to become vacant on the commencement of the amendments to the legislation. This is necessary administratively given the legislative requirement that qualifications and experience must collectively be achieved by the selection process. In addition, the legislative sunset provision prevents the phase-in of new board members appointed for a normal three year period as the terms of current board members expire.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although current board appointments will continue until 30 June 1995, I want to take this opportunity to thank the current board members for their work up to that period and place on record that this necessary action is no reflection on their performance. There is no doubt that the selection committee which will be convened shortly to commence the selection process for the new boards will give full consideration to current board members should they make themselves available for selection. I also want to take this opportunity to thank the chairs of the AMLC, John Kerin and of the MRC, Robin Bligh, for their stewardship of the corporations at what has been an unsettling period for industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMLC board members will need to collectively possess qualifications and experience in the following fields of activity: live-stock production; the processing and export of meat; business management; finance and industrial relations; the promotion of products; and the international marketing of products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MRC board members will need to possess qualifications and experience in the following fields of activity: live-stock production; the processing and export of meat; business management and finance; administration of research and development; commercialisation of the results of research and development; and conservation and management of natural resources and environmental and ecological matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The criteria for board selections for the corporations encompass qualifications and experience that are necessary for effective decision taking and effective delivery of MIC strategies. Effective delivery of MIC strategies also requires that AMLC and MRC board members possess an ability to understand strategic plans and how programs can be developed to achieve those plans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An opportunity has also been taken in the legislation to streamline selection committee arrangements. Whilst it is accepted that previous selection committees have done an excellent job with their selections, there is now no real need for a seven person selection committee to represent industry, particularly since the strategic planning, policy development and industry funding decisions are to be taken by the MIC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the success of future arrangements, it is very important that broad strategic planning and policy decisions are taken in the MIC and not in the corporation boards&mdash;and that the boards are skills based for their program delivery role. For the success of future arrangements, it is very important that broad strategic planning and policy decisions are taken in the MIC and not in the corporation boards&mdash;and that the boards are skills based for their program delivery role. The selection committee is therefore reduced from seven members to four and moves away from the specific representative approach under current legislation. The new legislation provides for a four person selection committee with an independent chair appointed by the minister and three members on the nomination of the MIC, which the minister would also appoint.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be necessary to convene a selection committee as soon as possible and before the new legislation is in place on 1 July 1995 to begin the task of selecting members for the AMLC and MRC boards. It is appropriate that this be undertaken on the basis which is to be followed under the new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two other issues identified by the IC inquiry into meat processing which impact on the meat and livestock industry and its ability to become more competitive&mdash;industrial relations and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. These two issues are being pursued by the government under separate processes and are not the subject of the reforms under this legislation. I propose therefore to only make a few observations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable members would be aware that in regard to both matters progress is being made. The Industrial Relations Act provides an effective framework for progressing industrial relations issues and the parties to it are commencing to use it with more frequency. To date some thirty four enterprise agreements have been certified by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. A national industry consultative council has now been established under the auspices of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and will facilitate and encourage the parties to work together in resolving industrial relations difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has been reforming the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service over the past two years and is firmly committed to continuing this process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislative changes are about industry facing up to and being responsible for their own actions through self regulation. But the government has no intention of walking away from the industry as it pursues this course. Industry and government can and will work together in a cooperative relationship to meet the commercial challenges ahead&mdash;one that recognises the importance of an industry leadership role and of commercial judgment and responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry has the necessary leadership capability and will have the benefit of the new statutory arrangements to drive the changes that are required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK (QUOTAS) AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990 to provide the new Meat Industry Council (MIC) with a range of options that it can consider when developing the policy framework for quota administration. This is achieved by extending the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation's (AMLC) powers to implement a quota scheme to those markets that impose quota tariffs on imports of Australian meat and live-stock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMLC may, at present, impose a quota system for those markets where quotas are imposed on the import of Australian meat and livestock. In line with industry's enhanced decision-making role and the move to deregulation, it is intended that the MIC will be able to contract out quota administration from the AMLC under the Meat and Livestock Industry Act 1995 and this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation includes provisions that will permit the allocation of quota free of charge or by auction, sale by tender or private sale. This will allow industry, via the corporation, to recoup part of the price premium that can, at times, result when import restrictions are invoked by importing countries. It is important that the MIC is not constrained in its analysis of options by legislation that predicates only one option&mdash;and that is the status quo of allocation of quota free of charge. Under the current AMLC Act, the AMLC is already empowered to sell quota for livesheep and lambs, although this power has not been used to date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill forms part of a legislative package designed to give industry a greater role and responsibility in deciding its own affairs and move it to a less regulated environment. It is envisaged that the statutory authorities under this legislative package will revert to a non-statutory status, but having provided a framework within which the industry can effectively operate over the longer term.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I may just respond on three things. In the past we have passed the appropriation bills before the estimates processes have been completed but, nevertheless, that is not a normally desirable process. The government would prefer to pass them today. If they are to be adjourned then, when they come back, if you have points of complaint to make about the progress of estimates committees and answers, et cetera, they will be taken into account at that stage. They should not be put as a requirement now up front in an adjournment motion. I think it is a fair point to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they are brought back, which presumably will be Monday or Tuesday, you can then make the point and seek explanations as to why the estimates report or answer is not in et cetera. Under this motion, if they are not in by Tuesday or even Wednesday, we do not get to bring them back because there is that part of the motion that precludes us doing so. It does not even allow for a reasonable discussion when they are brought back. It seems to me more sensible to not make it conditional, because you still get a second shot at the title. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 [1995]. It is indicative of the appalling mismanagement of this Labor government that this legislation has been listed on the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for debate for over two months. It was expected to be debated well before the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now seeing consequences of that budget, intended and otherwise, which have the potential to make export market development grants more difficult to access. This is notwithstanding the budget forecast for 1995-96 of a current account deficit of some $27 billion. If we are not to leave the next generation a true banana republic, exports must be increased, as must import replacement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of import replacement is one for further debate but it was interesting to note the answers that Senator Cook gave in question time today. As he has done time and time again, he excused the most incredible current account deficit by saying that we are adding to our capital imports. I think he used the words `adding to our capital stock'. He does not attempt to answer the question of why we are importing that capital stock instead of making it ourselves, but that is another matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export market development grant scheme has been in operation for over 20 years. It is an export incentive scheme operated by Austrade, the principal feature of which is to provide an incentive for firms to promote their products in overseas markets. This incentive makes grants which are payable on 50 per cent of eligible expenditure on overseas promotions. A minimum expenditure of $30,000 is required and the maximum grant in any one year&mdash;up until the recent budget&mdash;was $250,000. It has been reduced in this budget to $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These grants are added to taxable income. Thus a profitable company returns 33 per cent&mdash;or did; it will now return 36 per cent because of the increase in company tax in the recent budget&mdash;of a grant to the government. So where a company is profitable, it will receive a grant where it expends more than $30,000, but 33 per cent of that grant of $15,000 up to $200,000 will be paid back to the government by way of company tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a tourism perspective, this bill has a number of significant features. The scheme is to be extended for four years beyond its present 1994-95 expiry date. Single service tourist operators will, for the first time since 1985, be eligible to receive grants but only at half the rate applicable to other exporters. You have to ask why this great industry is being singled out for treatment that does not apply to other exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill excludes as eligible expenditure the cost of tourism samples. This shows a complete lack of understanding of the industry and I will say more about that later. The bill does not allow as eligible expenditure costs incurred by joint ventures and consortia. That discriminates against small business operators, particularly those in regional areas which band together for specific events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology concluded that not only is it inequitable to have one sector of the tourism industry ineligible for assistance through the export market development grant scheme, but it is also inequitable that exporters of manufactured goods and other service exporters are eligible for assistance while other exporters are not. The committee recommended that tourism be given full access to the scheme and, importantly, that this access should not be contingent on any corresponding decrease in funds to the Australian Tourist Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response to the recommendations, as announced in the budget, was to allow access to the scheme by all tourism operators but only at the rate of 25 per cent of eligible expenditure&mdash;half the rate applicable to other participants. Naturally, the industry is annoyed that the government continues to treat its members as second-class citizens. The government has no hesitation, when it suits, in putting out all sorts of press releases on tourism. We have seen them from the Minister for Tourism, Michael Lee. The Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, has talked about the great value of the tourism industry and, in a media release on 2 March, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Growth&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in exports&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was driven primarily by the strong performance of travel services exports which have become Australia's highest performing service export, recording real growth of over 12 per cent a year over the last decade.</PARA>
<PARA>The tourist industry, which is getting close to earning $12 billion a year in foreign currency, brings in more than the cumulative export earnings from iron ore, wheat, alumina, aluminium, sugar and petroleum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry has the capacity for further substantial expansion as a result of increasing market activity expenditure by overseas visitors being distributed among a wide range of industries, not just tourism. The benefits of tourism are spread throughout the country because tourists leave their money behind in regions. This is a wonderful way of re-distributing income without the pain of the Labor Party's method of doing so. It is estimated that, on average, for every 17 overseas visitors, one Australian job is created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is denied other key facilities under this scheme. It is not permitted to form joint ventures or consortia&mdash;rather, that is permitted but is not worthwhile when applying for export market development grants&mdash;nor is it allowed to include the cost of providing samples as part of eligible promotional expenditure. This should and must be corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism is one of the most fiercely competitive industries in the world with all countries attempting to maximise the number of people visiting and keeping them within their boundaries for the maximum period of time. As with any other export industry&mdash;in fact any industry&mdash;the key factors are a good product, competitive costs, good service and promotion. Each of these factors is of critical importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our own tourism industry has done an incredible job. Tourism growth did not just happen; it has come about as a result of intensive marketing by theme parks, resorts, hotels, tourism authorities, airlines and inbound tour operators&mdash;I might say ably assisted in the early 1980s by the action of the then Queensland government which saw the potential and gave every assistance to those industries to get them off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By its very nature it is an expensive exercise. It is, however, the classic example of money having to be spent to be earned. Studies have indicated that there is a 32 to one ratio of returns to expenditure: that is, for every $1 spent on tourism promotion, $32 comes back into Australia. There are not too many industries&mdash;if any&mdash;that can match that sort of ratio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one who was involved in an export industry for many years, I can relate to the work involved. Whilst on the surface this particular industry may appear glamorous, it is in reality very tough work. Obtaining new markets for any product is difficult. Anyone who pretends otherwise has not been in it. Having attained those markets, they must be regularly serviced and this means continual follow-up and innumerable courtesy calls on buyers. Without that follow-up there will inevitably be market failure. You must have follow-up and you must continue to give service. I do not simply mean service to the tourists themselves; I mean service to the people overseas who put together the packages to send people to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, the tourism industry in Australia attracts over three million international tourists and brings in between $11 billion and $12 billion in foreign exchange. It is estimated that each foreign tourist contributes by way of indirect taxes&mdash;fuel excise, wholesale sales tax and all the taxes that we know about that hit us in this country&mdash;around $400 to government revenue. This amounts to a total of $1.2 billion each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry employs directly and indirectly around 500,000 Australians. Depending upon how one measures who is employed in the tourism industry, that figure could well approach one million Australians. I can give an example. I have a son-in-law who has a business on the Gold Coast. He would not consider himself to be part of the tourism industry, but he would not have the business if it was not for the tourism industry. He employs something like 90 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that inbound tourism is not only an export industry but also one in which foreign currency is brought into Australia without the necessity of sending out goods, whether they be manufactured, mined or grown. It could be termed an economically sustainable industry. With any other export something has to happen&mdash;something has to be mined, something has to be grown, or something has to be value added. The goods are sent out of the country and in return for those goods we receive foreign currency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry brings people to Australia. They look at our rainforests; they visit the reef; they stay in our hotels; and they leave their money behind in the region visited.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite right, Senator Ray&mdash;casinos. The money is left in the region. Why is this industry being discriminated against by this government? The government is treating the industry as a second-class earner of foreign exchange. It is one of our most valuable earners of foreign income. It is irresponsible for a government, which has created a current account deficit of some $27 billion this year, to walk away from an opportunity to wind back that deficit. A responsible approach would allow us to employ more Australians&mdash;particularly young Australians. As I mentioned earlier, one more Australian can be employed for every 17 tourists coming to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From an equitable point of view inbound tourism must be treated on the same basis as any other export industry. In the committee stage I will be moving amendments on behalf of the coalition to correct this clear discrimination against one of our few remaining industries which is labour intensive and which has so much potential for growth. No-one can assume that this growth will happen automatically. Tourism is one of the most competitive industries in the world. It is competitive between countries; it is competitive within countries; it is competitive between states; and it is competitive within regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will move that export market development grants to tourism are to be the same as those offered to all other exporters. That is equitable. What the government is proposing is a minor step forward, but it is not equitable. Under the previous system the tourism industry was allowed to claim the full export market development grant but only if operators had multiple tourism facilities. A single tourism operator was not entitled to claim the export market development grant. From that point of view this legislation is an improvement, but it remains totally inequitable in comparison with other industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under our amendments samples will be allowed as an eligible cost in determining grants when traditional export sample products are sent to buyers. In any other industry market samples are part of the cost of doing business. These samples are sent or taken overseas and are part of the cost when calculating how much has been spent on export market development grants. With tourism we cannot send the sample overseas. We have to bring the buyer to the sample. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, someone who has a resort must bring potential buyers in to look at the resort so that they can program it. That is a difficult task because we are competing with a lot of other countries in the world. We are not the only people with sandy beaches; we are not the only people with coral reefs; and we are not the only people with golf courses. People have to be shown what we have to offer. They have to be shown the standard of accommodation and the standard of service. There is no other option. That is what we mean by sampling within the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism joint ventures and consortia should be permitted to apply for grants. This is of particular relevance to the regional areas. This may go some way to covering the amendment that I know Senator Spindler is going to move. Everyone is aware that the promotion of tourism is not cheap. Joint ventures and consortia would enable operators&mdash;whether they be resorts or whatever&mdash;to get together and market a particular region as a region. This is not permitted under the government's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment would enable that to happen. It would be in the interests of regions that do not currently have a great influx of overseas tourists. It would also be a lot cheaper than some of the government sponsored programs which are really only a matter of handing out money to very happy and grateful consultants. Our amendments are in accordance with the tourism industry's beliefs and aspirations which were voiced by the Tourism Council of Australia in the section on the EMDG scheme in its pre-budget submission for the 1995-96 budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will not be until all tourism operators are given full and equitable access under the scheme, in a manner consistent with all other eligible applicants, that the industry will consider that effective reform has been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition's legislative approach to the tourism industry will be consistent in its drive to recognise tourism as a major resource industry in the same league as agriculture, mining and manufacturing&mdash;it is no different. In fact, it may be even claimed by people like Senator Coulter that it has benefits, because you do not have to go through the process of value adding and doing all the other things that you may not like before you get the foreign currency into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the biggest single earner of export income in Australia. It is a major export industry. These aspirations are in the tradition of the coalition of protecting the interests of small business, because 80 per cent of people in the tourism industry are in small business, and increasing real employment opportunities&mdash;not phoney job schemes, but real employment opportunities which are sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The part-time Minister for Tourism is big on rhetoric, with warm fuzzy statements that he issues frequently at tourism functions and he claims credit for what is essentially industry success. When the chips are down, however, he has shown over and over again that he then deserts the very industry he claims to represent. Mr Costello is right. This particular minister does need adult supervision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. There are three main purposes of this bill: first, to extend the export market development grant scheme&mdash;called the EMDG scheme&mdash;until 1998-99; second, to allow single service tourism operators partial access to the scheme; and, third, to limit grants under the scheme to $250,000 per company group. The Australian Democrats are supporters of the EMDG scheme. We welcome the recognition inherent in this scheme that government has a role to play in helping small to medium businesses establish themselves as exporters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Price Waterhouse evaluation of the scheme which was released last year emphasises how valuable the EMDG scheme is to Australian business. The main findings were that, firstly, EMDG claimants increase their spending on export marketing promotion even in anticipation of a grant, and this results in increased exports; and, secondly, grant payments of $156 million resulted in additional marketing expenditure of $147 million and incremental exports of $1.4 billion. It is estimated that 42 per cent of the cost of the scheme is returned to the government in tax on the grants themselves and on profits from the additional exports generated. That is not counting sales tax on additional inputs required by exporters in expanding their businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business sector constantly tells us how valuable the scheme is and the number of businesses accessing the scheme continues to grow year on year. It must be very difficult for the government and for the coalition to continue to espouse their `hands-off, free market outcomes are the only efficient outcomes' attitude to other areas of trade and industry policy when this just about only interventionist scheme has been so outstandingly successful. All our major trading partners consistently and overtly assist their strategically important industries. I do not believe that the government's rejection of a policy approach based on pragmatic intervention and the fact that we have had a monthly current account deficit of over $2 billion for now six successive months is coincidental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the Democrats support the EMDG scheme, we welcome the bill and the extension of the scheme until 1998-99. We do, however, have some concerns about the EMDG scheme itself, about some of the changes proposed in the bill and about the process which led to the legislative formulation of these changes. The first and most important concern is that the scheme is in danger of losing sight of the fact that its main focus is small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, against the strong opposition of the Australian Democrats, this chamber passed legislation which restricted use of the joint venture mechanism in the EMDG scheme by limiting joint ventures to only five grants under the scheme. The big individual players are entitled to up to eight grants. Joint ventures and consortia are the mechanisms by which businesses too small to access grants themselves could come together to meet the expenditure threshold. That decision therefore was a retrograde step, in the view of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best example is the expenditure threshold itself, which requires firms to specify the amount of money before they qualify for grants under the scheme. I believe it is anti-small business. Over the last few years the expenditure threshold has been progressively increased from $5,000 to $10,000 in 1988 and eventually to its current level of $30,000 in 1990&mdash;over strong opposition to the Australian Democrats. In addition, the first $15,000 of expenditure was made ineligible for rebate. If the scheme is aimed at small business, why does the government keep making it harder for small business to use it? It is like setting up an office designed to assist people in wheelchairs and then putting the office at the top of six flights of stairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats believe that, if a small business spends $15,000, that is a significant amount of money and it shows a commitment to exporting. I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment to reduce the expenditure threshold for the EMDG scheme from $30,000 to $15,000, where it was before. I am looking forward to the support of the coalition parties for that amendment, but I am told by Senator Parer&mdash;and he indicated this in his speech&mdash;that that is unlikely. So much for the commitment of the coalition to small business!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is that, as we would expect from a government that is almost ashamed about the success of such an interventionist scheme, the proposed changes to the scheme with regard to tourism do not go far enough. The Australian Democrats called for full inclusion in the EMDG scheme for single service tourism operators well before the May 1994 budget. Immediately after the white paper we asked the obvious question: why are these tourism operators being treated like second-class exporters? The government has been repeatedly putting out reports emphasising how important services exports were to Australia's future. The government calls it the silent revolution in services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism exports are by far the largest single contribution to the exports of that sector. So why is the government being half-hearted about giving this industry our support? I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment to grant single service tourism operators full access to the scheme&mdash;grants of 50c in the dollar for eligible expenditure, as all other industries enjoy, instead of the miserly 25c in the dollar proposed in this bill. We have reached that conclusion quite independently of the thoughts of the coalition on it. While the coalition may well get the jump in the order of things in this chamber to move this amendment, this is a Democrat amendment and I will be moving it if I can. That is not to say that we did not have some concerns about the environmental impact of the tourism industry, and that is certainly an issue that has concerned us for some time. The argument has been put, and there is some validity to it, that the travel in large numbers across large distances will add to greenhouse emissions on a global scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we believe it is important that we decide as a nation how we treat tourists, where we channel them, how we transmit to them the benefits of ecologically sustainable tourism, how we share our knowledge in these particular areas and how we derive not only financial benefits but also cultural and social benefits from contact with people from other countries. So, on balance, the Australian Democrats have decided that this particular equalisation measure for the tourism industry is justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third concern about the EMDG scheme is that it is far too complicated. The legislation itself reads as if it were written by public servants for public servants so that only public servants can make sense of it. Confronted with such a mess, a small business manager is virtually compelled to hire either a lawyer or a consultant to help him deal with the scheme. Immediate legislative and administrative simplification is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Related to this concern, since this bill was tabled a number of representations have been made by various industry groups who are upset by some of the proposed changes. There have been complaints from the Australian Book Publishers Association, Lithocraft Graphics, the Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation, Pacific Magazines and Printing and the Export Incentives Consultants Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been letters in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> from companies such as Weldon International. Coopers and Lybrand were openly critical of proposed changes in another article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, while the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Commercial News</EMPHASIS> also ran a story suggesting that some of the amendments in this bill are ill-thought out and could cost Australia exports and jobs. For an organisation supposedly servicing the business sector, Austrade certainly manages to put a lot of clients off base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this indicates a lack of industry consultation by Austrade prior to the drafting of the bill. While some of the changes were foreshadowed by the government in last year's white paper and the Price Waterhouse evaluation, this is not the same as active industry consultation. Certainly when so many changes are to be made in one bill to a scheme as complicated as EMDG, I believe Austrade has a responsibility to get out there and talk to the people who are going to be affected. If this had been done, a number of the other concerns I have about this bill could have been resolved months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the reason behind the restriction of grants to $250,000 per company group. Indeed, in principle I support the idea that this will prevent larger exporters from capturing a disproportionate share of available grants. However, it has become apparent that some groups have been hurt by this change. This has been made clear in some of the representations I mentioned. There is little evidence that any attempt has been made to address the apparently legitimate concerns contained in these representations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt the system is susceptible to being rorted in some cases. If a company is part of a group it might mean that if one company in the group has used up all its grants, the `next' export promotion could be undertaken by a subsidiary as a way of getting around the grant limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, other factors in this particular situation need to be taken into account. The definition of company `group' is defined as per sections 46 and 50 of the Corporations Law. Section 50 of the Corporations Law refers to situations where companies are related to each other. The Australian Book Publishers Association argues that this is not quite the same as being part of a group. They argue that `group' implies an administrative connection as well as financial. They also argue that being part of a group does not necessarily mean financing or team benefits, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;as an example, there are certain members of the Association which claim export grants and are related in terms of the Corporations Act. Rather than deriving team benefits, these companies have products designed for the export market and are actually in international competition with each other. Operating individually, the future viability of these companies is dependent upon the international success they can achieve. As a result, substantial sums have been expended upon travel, book fairs, relocation of staff to overseas promotional positions and the appointment of marketing representatives in various locations.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Book Publishers Association has raised a number of concerns which are worthy of consideration. I will be asking the minister to have a close look at how this particular provision operates and the extent to which it disadvantages particular members of a `group' in terms of the submissions made by the Book Publishers Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also quietly attempts to sneak through a few unforeshadowed increases in Austrade's power. The proposed changes to section 39 of the act make it a lot easier to convict people for attempted fraud against the EMDG scheme. Instead of requiring Austrade to prove that a person deliberately lied in their grant application, Austrade only has to prove that the person could have been reasonably expected to know that the information supplied was wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this amendment, although we will not make any attempt to amend it, is concerning from the civil liberties point of view. I have written to the minister asking him to obtain advice from the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) as to the consequences for individuals of this particular amendment. I have received a reply stating that this particular section does not stand alone, that it has been introduced in sections 85ZKA and ZKB of the Crimes Act and that the Social Security Act also has a provision for reckless misstatement. On the basis of that advice but with considerable concern, we will allow this provision to pass. But, again, I will ask the minister to monitor the effects of that and the Australian Democrats certainly will monitor it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other section of some concern is section 19 of the act in part 13. These amendments change the circumstances under which Austrade can credit a grant applicant with the EMDG claims history of a previous applicant. Currently, Austrade has a discretion to impute a previous applicant's claims history where the commission feels that there is an attempt to rort the system by reconstituting a defunct enterprise. Once again, we feel that this is a provision which could be misused and could result in unfairly prejudicing companies or individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, on investigation and in correspondence with the Attorney-General through the minister, we are advised that these matters are to be placed before the House in the form of regulations which the Senate will be in a position to disallow. On that basis, at this stage we are not taking any action about the provisions in this section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats believe that the EMDG scheme should be extended to services generally. I understand that Austrade is reviewing the coverage in this particular industry and the case for extended coverage and will be reporting shortly. That report was originally due in December 1994. It is now overdue and I look forward to receiving that report on how the scheme should be amended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of services will clearly generate additional export income for Australia, and it is clear that, in obtaining that income, the competition for the supply of the services will be strong with overseas suppliers. The potential increase in export income, as it is in tourism, will be significant. We must be conscious of the fact that exports through tourism and other services are a significant generator of employment in Australia, and it is the responsibility of this government to ensure that all measures are taken to intervene in the economy to achieve economic and social objectives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The export market development grants scheme came into being in 1975. Today, the legislation before the Senate, the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994, seeks to extend the scheme to 1999. The coalition embraces the scheme now, and did so in the past, because of the assistance it gives to small and medium sized businesses to seek and develop export markets and because it promotes an export culture in the business community. I agree with the remarks that Senator Spindler made concerning the emphasis needed to be given to small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme gives recipients financial incentives in the form of taxable grants which represent a practical reimbursement of promotional expenditure incurred in the pursuit of export markets. The grants reimburse 50 per cent of eligible expenditure incurred above $15,000, subject to a minimum expenditure of $30,000 and a maximum grant now of $200,000 per annum. Before the 1995 budget, the maximum was $250,000 per annum. The other change in the budget is the requirement now of an export pre-qualification test for new grant recipients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme has a wide level of awareness and usage by business. I should qualify my remarks by saying that the scheme would not be so appropriate in the right economic environment. By that, I mean the removal of the heavy burden of tax under which our export industries suffer and which saps their competitiveness. Exporters simply would not need this financial hand if taxes such as payroll tax, wholesale sales tax and fuel excise were waived. These taxes are impediments to a successful export culture and make Australia unique in prejudicing its exporters in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The priority must be to get the indirect tax burden off businesses that are competing against foreign competitors which, unlike Australian exporters, do not have one hand tied behind their backs. Exports are essential to tackle our continuing current account deficit and to lift our gross domestic product, which will benefit all Australians through an increased standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is an island nation. It is low in population but has a high level of technology and natural material resources, and it must export successfully or perish. With Australia spending over $70 million a day more than it earns, the export market development grants scheme is small fry in what should be a total effort to improve our current account. I have seen figures which suggest that, for every dollar spent in the export market development, the return to Australian exports is in excess of $100. Given our inequitable tax system, the EMDG scheme has been very beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a real problem: Australia successfully exports mining and primary produce&mdash;we have a natural advantage in those industries which allows them to compete&mdash;but, for general manufacturing industries, with the exception of niche and high technology manufacturing, I do not believe that our exporters can survive the burdens that we impose upon them. The reasons are simple: the tax lead, which I spoke of a minute ago, in their saddle bags and the size of our domestic population; in addition, the advantages offered by our competitors overseas to help set up factories with soft loans, free land, tax holidays and work practices and wages. For better or for worse, that makes our lifestyle look like the indulgence of Christopher Skase in comparison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EMDG scheme is small fry when you consider our current account problems. To hide behind a tariff wall is not fashionable and, ultimately, not economic. It is worth being reminded that we would not have the manufacturing base we now have&mdash;again, for better or for worse&mdash;if we had had a government in the 1950s and 1960s that had not been determined to develop past our natural advantage in primary production and in mining. The only way now for our economy to go is in continued economic reform, and that applies on the waterfront, in transport, in work practices and in our overall tax approach. That must be in addition to our overall commitment to import substitution. We must get off the import drip and develop a culture of paying our way, and that applies to every section and every age in the community. The export market development grants scheme provides help. We support it, and always have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 1994 evaluation of the EMDG scheme found that the scheme causes claimants to increase their spending on export marketing promotion in response to grants and that the additional promotion expenditure results in more exports. It also found that the scheme has some effect in encouraging firms to accelerate their planned development of new markets and in reducing the perceived commercial and financial risks associated with the export activity. In 1993-94, $195 million worth of EMDGs were paid to 3,277 claimants, compared with 2,473 claims with a value of $181 million in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw on personal knowledge of one exporter in my area of the north of New South Wales, Robert Hoddle Pty Ltd. This company is a model for the sort of export culture that we need to develop and encourage in any way we can. Operating from Gunnedah in New South Wales, it is an example of a decentralised export earner that is competing in an intensely competitive market in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This company began exporting chilled lamb to the Middle East at the beginning of 1994. In the first 12 months, it sent more than 17,000 lambs, offal and lamb cuts to six different countries. The company turnover was just over $1 million for its first financial year. It was unable to apply for an export market development grant because it had spent just under the minimum threshold of $30,000. It could have reached that threshold if the owner had travelled business class instead of economy class on his three visits to the Middle East. His wife's trip was not claimable, as they travelled at the same time. She is a director of the company, and it was through her contacts in the Middle East that the business was able to be commenced in this difficult market in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a small business, a husband and wife partnership, who else would travel? As the principal of the business indicated to me, if he had taken his truck driver and they had both gone business class, he would now have the EMDG scheme in the bank. This is not very satisfactory and shows a lack of understanding of the way small business operates. They attempted to apply for an EMDG in June this year, rolling together the first two years of operation to reach the threshold&mdash;and this is allowed under the present legislation&mdash;but it turned out to be of no assistance. The threshold of $15,000 for the first year was doubled to $30,000, it being a two-year period, and, instead of getting the budgeted return of about $8,000, having spent just over $30,000 on appropriate expenditure in the first 18 months, he got back virtually nothing. He was expecting to get about $8,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another exporter has raised the prospect of the potential for corruption within the scheme. This exporter was recently contacted by an agent who suggested that a man in a particular overseas country would engineer a scam. If the exporter paid this man $100,000, of which he would return $98,000, he would provide a bogus receipt for a year's consulting work in developing markets in this country. The Australian exporter's application would apparently then be treated as an EMDG potential claim for $100,000. This is clearly corrupt and wrong but obviously difficult to police. This is particularly so when you consider the number of new Australian residents who have families and relations still in the countries of their birth. The possibility of setting up a false expenditure trail seems endless. Whilst I acknowledge Austrade's attempts to fairly audit all EMDG claims, I have serious doubts about the audit trail of some cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the EMDG scheme, in absence of significant tax reforms that I have mentioned, is working well in providing assistance to fledgling exporters but there are still areas that need to be tightened up. To properly target government assistance is always difficult. There is a recognition by the coalition that this scheme is useful. I note from Senator Spindler's comments that the Democrats propose to move to reduce the threshold of the EMDG scheme from $30,000 to $15,000. This is superficially attractive, but there is the requirement of being a bona fide claimant. It makes it more difficult apropos of my comments about the scheme being available to rollover for the first two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On balance, the coalition believes that, as administrative costs to run the scheme are taken out of the total appropriation for the EMDG scheme, to reduce it to $15,000 would threaten to cancel out the scheme's benefits. Additionally, we support the $30,000 threshold to encourage firms to spend realistic amounts on export development, subject of course to the problems of doubling the threshold or rollover in the first two years of expenditure. Our commitment to small business is not based only on the EMDG scheme; it is much broader than that. In terms of the problems that small business face with capital gains tax, we need a much more equitable approach for the building of business, particularly the development of small business. In the interests of the program, it has been indicated that I wind up my comments. Accordingly, we support the EMDG scheme. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray knows how to approach the coalition and talk turkey on these matters, but Senator Faulkner does not. This bill is one of the best examples yet. We have been suffering $2 billion deficits month in and month out. This country cannot remember the last time we had a trade deficit less than $2 billion. I would have thought this bill would have brought a little more urgency than it has. I support the amendments of Senator Parer in regard to the tourist industry. Those amendments are supported by the Democrats. We will be moving amendments to this legislation to give far more partial and equitable access by the tourist industry to the export management development scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like my colleagues, I would like to outline the benefits of the export development grants scheme. The scheme provides taxable cash grants of up to $250,000 per annum and is based primarily on expenditure incurred by an Australian person or company seeking to create or expand exports of their products in overseas markets. The major amendments proposed by this bill give effect to the recommendations of the 1994 evaluation of the scheme undertaken by the government. This scheme is worth while. It can help make up for some of the trade problems in this country that have been manifested month in and month out by $2.3 billion deficits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put that into context, Australia's total exports to GDP ratio are below 18 per cent, compared with an average of 30 per cent for the OECD countries and New Zealand. Today our foreign debt is $160 billion or 37 per cent of GDP. As each month goes by, as each deficit piles up, that foreign debt increases. Our current account deficit is projected to blow out to over $26 billion, as predicted in the last budget brought down in May. That figure is over six per cent of GDP. As has been said many times&mdash;and it deserves to be reiterated&mdash;only one other country has that sort of problem, and that is Mexico. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Equally disturbing are the ABS figures for April which show that in original terms exports fell by some eight per cent or $502 million. That has become the trend month in, month out. Rural exports in April fell by over 10 per cent, wool was down and cereals were down. Non-rural exports in April, to follow the trend each month, were down some seven per cent or $329 million. Metals and ore exports were down, machinery exports were down, other mineral fuels were down and all other manufacturing products were down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A close study of the figures indicates that we ought to be very concerned that the trend is showing that our export figures have not turned around for one single month. What is worse, these figures reflect a decline in Australia's competitiveness and our international market share. For all the efforts and boasting that this government subjects upon us to export into Asia, the true figures show that for every Asian country that we export into we are losing market share. Australia's share of the Asian APEC imports has fallen from 4.1 per cent to 3.1 per cent. Australia's share of the Japanese imports&mdash;our major trading partner&mdash;has fallen from 5.75 per cent to five per cent. That is between 1985 and 1993. During the last eight years, when the real push into Asia was said to have occurred, we lost market share. Australia's share of Thailand's imports has fallen from 1.65 per cent to 1.1 per cent between 1985 and 1993. So our market share has fallen in just about every market we export to. In the Middle East we have fallen from 1.8 per cent to 1.1 per cent. In the United States, once a very strong trading partner of ours, we have fallen from one per cent to 0.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern is so great that the government has acted upon this fall and instigated an inquiry into the matter in regard to our trade deficit with the United States. A report from the United States shows that Australia suffers the world's fastest growing trade deficit with the US. While Japan, China and most of the world's other major trading nations enjoy a growing surplus with the United States, Australia is the reverse. That comes at a worrying time because Japan and the United States are desperately locked into a pending trade war. That should be very concerning for Australia as we are surely to suffer some of the fall-out if that occurred. This pending trade war between Japan and America comes at a time when one of the success stories of Australia's recent economic performance&mdash;elaborately transformed manufactured goods&mdash;has taken a dive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. Let me begin by saying a few words in tribute to my predecessor, former Senator Stephen Loosley. It is ironic that it was in his mother's kitchen, in December 1975, that I decided I wanted to serve the Labor Party in parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had been scrutineering in the old federal seat of St George. It was one of the darkest hours for the Australian Labor Party. We scrutineered up until Christmas Eve, if memory serves me, and we went down by only 56 votes in an electorate of 52,000. We returned to Steve's parents' house and, over a cup of tea, I made my decision. I might also say, Mr President, that I remember asking Steve what he thought the cure was for the economic ills that plagued the country in 1975. He replied that he believed in some form of state capitalism! We have both come a long way since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stephen Loosley is a loss to the parliament. I think all  sides of politics recognised his ability, particularly in the field of foreign affairs. Few politicians in the world can claim to be on first name terms with the Vice President of the United States. Nevertheless, in going at a time of his choosing and finding a rewarding position entirely of his own making, Stephen has made himself available, in due course, to work with the government on foreign affairs in a more specialist capacity. I am sure I join with all senators in hoping that that opportunity comes before too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is traditional, I want to thank some of the many people who have helped me on my way here today. The two people to whom I owe most in life are my ex-wife, Frances Cowell, and my step-daughter, Ophelia Cowell. Frances stood by me through the worst things that have ever happened to me in my 42 years, and she has never wavered in her support. The transition from a self-centred single life to one of marriage, career and family is never easy, particularly if you are ambitious. It takes all the energy and confidence of youth, plus a durable faith in yourself. I do not know how people do it without a partner. Frances shared all my disappointments and my successes, and I am glad to say that, even though we have gone our separate ways, we are still close friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ophelia is my living, walking conscience. Every politician has to have a fair dose of cynicism and expediency simply to survive. Fortunately for me, in Ophelia I have someone close to me who gently reminds me that cynicism and expediency are not appealing virtues in people. Her unwillingness to judge, her clear perception of right and wrong and her ability to be angry but still abhor violence always bring me back to the true standards for my political behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I cannot forget the rest of my immediate family: my father, who gave me the skills to survive in a less than perfect world; and my mother, who taught me that kindness, forgiveness and compassion can be manly virtues. Unfortunately, my mother did not live long enough to see me here today. I would also like to thank my sister, Sara Smith, who is the only person in the world who believes that I can do no wrong. Fortunately, her husband Norm is a dyed-in-the-wool Labor supporter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one person who stands out, to whom I owe more than anyone else in politics, and that is John Della Bosca. We have known each other for about 20 years now, and we were friends before we were colleagues. John is living proof that the right wing of the New South Wales Labor Party will go on forever. When John Ducker retired from politics, I thought we would never see his like again. To my amazement, Graham Richardson arose. Later, when Graham was making another of his pleas that he would retire from politics, which none of us ever believed, I wondered where we would ever find another person with that strategic flair and acute political judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet our tribe always produces someone who is prepared to work harder and suffer more stress than God ever intended, someone who will put up with poor pay for enormous responsibility and who also happens to be brilliant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that in the recent state election in New South Wales, when Labor won against the odds and against the polls and against the press, the world has finally seen just what John Della Bosca can do. For my part, he has not changed in 20 years. He still looks shambolic, he still has trouble returning phone calls and he is still the most loyal friend I have in politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other person who has profoundly affected my political life is the Prime Minister, Paul Keating. He is the best boss I have ever had. He does not need me to write his place in history because it is already there. When historians survey the scope and depth of his achievement, from deregulation of the Australian economy to the creation of Australia's future through APEC, it will be truly astounding that one person could do so much in only 12 years of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the nine months that I worked for him, I saw the profound and fundamental change to the labor market programs, the social security system and regional assistance that was Working Nation. I saw the landmark recognition of the arts community and Creative Nation, which has secured the future for the arts community in the growing technological age. More than that, I saw the preparatory building blocks of APEC. Any one of those achievements would do an ordinary politician's career proud, yet I saw it all in only nine months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I fear that history will be kinder to Paul Keating than his contemporaries. I have been one of the fortunate few who have seen the private Paul Keating. He speaks softly. He is a man very slow to anger and very quick to praise. He is absolutely loyal to his staff, who become almost like family. A senior public servant who has served several prime ministers now once said to me that the one thing that impressed her was that all of Paul Keating's former staff always spoke of Paul in the fondest and most loyal terms. I think that says it all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paul Keating also taught me a very important lesson. If you want to achieve change, you have to be prepared to kick and punch and bang the table. You have to make people so frightened that they dare not fail to do what you ask. The weight of inertia, the resistance to change in Canberra, is absolutely unbelievable. If I had not seen it myself, I would not believe how quickly any change just runs into the mud. It always seems easier for people to do it tomorrow or do nothing at all, despite the efforts of many hardworking and committed public servants in this city. It takes incredible strength of will and character to pick this country up with your bare arms and stagger forward, to put it down again even a few steps further on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael Lee has been a friend too long for me to think of him as a boss, but I was still impressed by his diligence and his quick judgment when I finally came to work for him. Michael is one of those rare and valuable people who are there when you really need them. I am afraid that he has done far more for me than I have done for him. Fortunately, I share Graham Richardson's judgment that Michael bears the stamp of future leadership, so I trust that I will have plenty of opportunity in the future to redress the balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are too many other people to mention. There are old friends going back 25 years, like Phil Davey and Chris Atkins. There are new friends like Shirley Smith. I cannot thank them all individually, but I am humble in the knowledge that no-one ever gets into this great parliament on their own efforts alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I would like now to turn to the beliefs which have led me here today. I can sum up my philosophy in one simple statement&mdash;`We are all in the same boat.' It is a very simple idea and it is simply said. I believe you cannot rip off someone else and not expect to be ripped off yourself somewhere down the track. What goes around, comes around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I say we are all in the same boat, I believe that complicated, exquisitely worked out political theories all came crashing down with the Berlin Wall. The carefully integrated logic that was communism produced some equally elegant theories in opposition to it, but at the end of the day the human race has proven too independent and too adaptable for such theories. Nevertheless, there are still fundamental truths to guide politicians and governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People still want freedom. Every individual wants to be respected in his or her own right and I believe there are still political ideas to which we can aspire. Indeed, as my friend and teacher, Elaine Thomson, points out, when the Australian Labor Party first came into being, it infuriated the likes of Vladimir Lenin in Europe. It was not a party worked out with a pen and paper. It was not the result of a lengthy theoretical argument. It was a party born of the hard lessons learnt by trade unionists in the difficult struggle with their opponents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can say we are all in the same boat in any number of different ways. If you care about the environment, you talk about spaceship earth hurtling through space with nowhere to put out the garbage. If you believe, as I do, that my state, New South Wales, is indeed the premier state and that the Blues should naturally win every State of Origin football match, it is the same idea. If you care about community relations and you want to call Coogee Beach, where I live, a village, it amounts to the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is natural for human beings to live together. We are not hermits and we cannot live like hermits. Civil society is the natural form of social organisation all over the globe and wherever people live together there is government. The existence of government is as natural as the existence of society itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me emphasise my view, Mr President, by stating clearly what I do not believe. I do not believe that society is made up of individuals, like a sack of potatoes&mdash;to borrow a phrase from Karl Marx&mdash;where the potatoes have nothing else in common but the sack. I do not believe in some atomistic world where people all exist independently of each other and that somehow, if you leave them alone, it will all work out all right. To abandon society to its own ends is to abdicate the fundamental responsibility to govern. There is no such thing as less government or more government: there is only good government and bad government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know what happens when a government leaves society to its own devices&mdash;all the evidence is in&mdash;the rich will rule. Wherever a government fails in its responsibility, it is the rich who benefit. Much gets more. It is an inevitable fact of life that the rich already dominate society. Despite the good efforts of this government's Justice Statement, we still have the finest justice money can buy; nor is there any doubt in anyone's mind that if Medicare were removed we would have the finest health system money could buy. It does not matter whether you talk about food or housing or music or fashion, it is a whole lot more fun if you are rich. At least that is what the advertising agents would have you believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that a free market will solve every political problem either. I am the first to say that the market is often more efficient than bumbling attempts by government, but to elevate the market to some universal good where hard work is all that is required for success is both cruel and nonsensical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was working as a storeman and packer I came across a man&mdash;let's call him Ivan&mdash;who was shy and socially awkward. You would not call him terribly bright, but he could wrap more parcels with less paper and less string than anyone else. And he worked as hard as he possibly could. But what would a free market offer Ivan? His employer could pay Ivan not one cent more than he absolutely had to. Anything Ivan had in the world would be bid away because he did not have the wit to hang on to it. Hard work would not save him. Whatever the free marketeers say, Adam Smith was too moral a man to believe that greed was actually good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No, Mr President, there is absolutely no point in any government throwing its hands in the air because it is all too hard and leaving everything to the rich. The rich have a right to quiet enjoyment of their private property and a right to increase their wealth if they wish. That is enough for anyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, I believe the Australian Labor Party is best able to take up the responsibility of government in Australia. The Labor Party not only has a collection of bright minds headed in the right direction, it has a heart that feels for people and it has a soul that knows its destiny is to care for all the people of this country, whoever they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Better still, the Labor Party has a history, now over 100 years, of doing exactly that. It is no flash in the pan. It is no product of a long lunch with advertising executives. It is the vanguard of a movement which has outlived all its opponents and endured through some of the worst disappointments and suffering any political party can experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also stress that I consider single issue parties to be a perversion of the democratic system. I may disagree fundamentally with the values held by the party sitting opposite, but at least it is a mass party which proffers a complete view of government action. To come here with only one concern, or even four concerns, is again an abdication of the responsibility to govern. It is a fraud on the electorate and a distortion of the process of good government. Governments have to make choices and take everything into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I would also like to say a few words about the things I see now in society that I believe demand attention. First, there is the family. Consider for a moment what the necessary and worthwhile economic changes of the last decade have done to the institution of the family. We can be proud now that three out of four students finish high school, but that means that their parents have to support them financially at home for at least another two years. We can be proud that we have restructured Australian industry and made it more efficient and world competitive, but that means that dad has probably lost his job or had to radically change his career in the middle of his working life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We can be proud that the participation of women in the workforce has dramatically increased and that now women are more economically independent. But now Mum has to work to pay the family bills and she is not at home to look after the kids. We can be proud that Australians have been willing to work more flexible hours so that business can offer services when consumers want them. But school hours remain the same and yes, I am happy to say that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was right when he said that there should be a change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Neal, in her first speech, pointed out that only 40 per cent of families are now constituted by Mum, Dad and their kids. The other 60 per cent are constituted differently. Nevertheless, these families are people who are prepared to take on the hardest job in life&mdash;that is, caring for each other and bringing up children in a changing and often hostile world. It does not matter how they choose to group themselves together, they deserve credit for making the effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A friend of mine lives in Northcote in Melbourne with ten other people, including a much loved and very happy child, and not including their dog called Fang. Someone in local government in Northcote wants to turn them out of their house because they have only two bathrooms and two toilets for ten people. That someone in local government has really lost the plot. It is not a boarding house; it is a family. As a family it deserves help, not condemnation. I am happy and proud to say that this Labor government has gone out of its way to be flexible in family support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has not sought to be judgmental. It has sought to help people. I believe it is time for another Royal Commission into Human Relations. Gough Whitlam aptly described the reaction of the then opposition to the last such royal commission as a group of schoolboys hunting through for the dirty bits. Now I feel we are all a bit more mature, and the ordinary person would gain a lot from information about how their relationships with other people compare with everyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second concern I have, Mr President, is with secondary education. I know that the constitution gives this responsibility to the states but, as is often the case, the issue will not be taken seriously until the Commonwealth starts the ball rolling. There are now record numbers of students completing secondary education. They are sitting for the Higher School Certificate en masse. Unfortunately, in my experience as an employer, the HSC qualifies them for almost nothing except to go on to university. Secondary school students have a right to expect that they will receive an education that will fit them for employment. They have a right to expect that if they apply themselves and work hard they will receive a qualification which will enable them to get a job that reflects their talents and the effort they have made at school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite the opposite is the case. Students who attain the Higher School Certificate in New South Wales are almost unemployable. What is tragic about that is that those students submit themselves to unbelievable stress in order to succeed, with all manner of pressure from parents and the society at large. The syllabus has changed depressingly little since I was at school. It is reminiscent of medieval tests for witchcraft, where the suspects were forced to walk on burning hot ploughshares or plunge their arms into boiling water. If the wounds healed in a week, the suspects were found to be innocent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has at least recognised the problem and has gone a fair way to addressing it. The Commonwealth initiatives to raise the standing of the TAFE system are long overdue. So, too, are the measures announced in Working Nation that will better manage the transition from school to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also astounding to me that the most important cabinet decision of the last few years rated little more than three small columns in the daily press. The government has decided to connect every school and every public library to the network. Nothing could better ensure that a student in Bourke has the same standard of education as a student in St Ives. The net is the future of education in Australia and it offers a clear advantage for our youth over their contemporaries in the rest of Asia. Even so, the Commonwealth needs to impress upon the states that allowing higher secondary education to be dominated by the requirements of the universities is the tail wagging the dog. Unless we as a nation offer our teenage students some better preparation for the workforce we will continue to sell out their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final concern is about the remoteness of government. I have serious concerns about the isolation of parliaments and the nature of regulation that parliaments are subjecting our citizens to. Compliance with the law is generally given voluntarily in Australia. We have a law-abiding society and people obey the law, not out of fear of the attendant penalties, but because they see it as the right thing to do. Governments would face an impossible task if every law had to be imposed by force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is relatively easy to make new laws. In these comfortable surroundings in Canberra, the Senate can pass laws with little direct evidence of the impact they will have on those people subject to them. However, there are more and more examples where the onus on the people has become simply too great. Two examples will serve to make my point. First, we have deregulated the labour market in this country. It has been a Herculean task. The change from nearly a century of rigid, centralised wage fixation to one incorporating all the flexibility and opportunity for creativity that is required by a modern and efficient economy, was absolutely essential. The job would have broken a lesser man than the Hon. Laurie Brereton. In a manner similar to the attributes I ascribed to the Prime Minister earlier, he has dragged the whole system forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, under this umbrella of excellent policy, the union representatives on the ground are struggling to meet the challenge. My own union, the clerks division of the ASU, has over 300 employers on state awards and even more on federal awards in New South Wales, and only a dozen field staff. The Australian Bureau of Statistics does not provide industry information on profitability, productivity, selling price inflation or current wage rates. In other words, the basic tools that any economist would expect to do the job are simply not there. The macro setting is excellent, but the micro application is far from what this parliament intended. Certainly the minister has provided funds to assist the union movement and employers in the process of adjustment, but there is still a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second example serves my point. A friend of mine decided to close her business, which employed eight people in two states, and reverted to being a sole trader. She simply could not keep up with the demands placed upon her by governments at all levels. If even one person makes such a decision, we all suffer. Unfortunately for us, she is not alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier that I do not believe in small government rhetoric. Those opposite have indulged in this rhetoric for many years, yet the conservative state governments have a worse record in over-regulation than the Commonwealth. At least the Commonwealth is committed and has committed itself to action through Working Nation, the Council of Business Representatives and the Corporate Law Simplification Task Force. Nevertheless, we need to be aware of what it is we are asking our citizens to do and to ask ourselves whether this really is a fair ask. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally I would like to say one small word about the future. The curse of all politicians is that we cannot know what the future holds. None of us is clairvoyant. We do not have a crystal ball to tell us exactly what will happen tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast that with the demands upon us to sell our policies. We must exude confidence in ourselves and in our ideas. We must look every inch the people who know what to do; the people who can be trusted to guide the nation forward. More than that, we must inspire confidence in other people. We must inspire a nation to have confidence in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that a measure of self doubt is essential to every politician. I admit that someone racked with self doubt is a dead loss in politics. Good policy will never succeed if it is mired in indecision. But inside all of us is a little voice that warns against dogma. There has to be sufficient humility to listen to the other side. A politician without some leavening of self doubt is, in my estimation, just plain dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I would like to thank you and the Senate for your patience. I know I have expressed many fine principles here today and I hope that my colleagues on this side of the chamber and all other honourable senators will remind me of them from time to time. I believe that God has a purpose for everyone in life and I hope his purpose for me is to be a politician. Certainly I will try my hardest to be a good one. Thank you. </PARA>

Then they might start to question whether we are doing the right thing for our country, or letting it go down the drain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Hughes correctly points out that, of the OECD countries, Australia is performing particularly poorly. Our ratio of exports to GDP is well behind that of our competitors, including one of our closest rivals, New Zealand&mdash;one I mentioned just a moment ago. The difference between Australia and New Zealand is that New Zealand has had the courage and fortitude&mdash;something this government is very short of&mdash;to tackle the necessary micro-economic reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the tourism aspects of this legislation, I am disappointed that the government still fails to recognise the ever increasing role played by the tourist industry. That the government should present legislation which positively discriminates against one of our greatest export earners is beyond me. I am yet to hear one satisfactory argument from the government why tourism operators should be eligible for only 25 cents in the dollar for their promotional and market development expenses while all other claimants receive 50 cents in the dollar. The amendments to be moved by Senator Parer will alter this inequity so that tourist operators receive just as much government assistance as the next person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you think that in 1993-94 3.2 million tourists visited Australia, with foreign exchange earnings totalling $10.7 billion or 12 per cent of our total export earnings, you can hardly say this industry should be treated as a second rate industry, which is how the government's legislation treats it. Between the Australian Tourist Commission and the Bureau of Tourism it is estimated that five million to 6.8 million international tourists will visit Australia in the year 2000. The income generated by this level of tourism is a very exciting prospect for Australia and I condemn the government for snubbing an industry which has the potential to reverse our current record trade deficit. I remind the chamber that eight of the last 12 monthly current account deficits have been $2 billion plus. That is an unprecedented occurrence and the government does not seem to care a nick about it. It does not really care about it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the Democrats for their decision to support the coalition's amendments to this bill. These are very important amendments for the tourism industry and I trust the government will now realise the flaws in its original legislation. However, the coalition will not support the amendment moved by the Democrats in relation to decreasing the expenditure threshold from $30,000 to $15,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Austrade definition of a small to medium business is a business with an annual turnover of up to $2 million. It would obviously be very easy for a business with this level of turnover to run up $30,000 worth of expenses developing its markets. Although it would appear attractive to decrease the threshold so that grants could be dispersed to more claimants, it would be of far greater benefit to have a threshold which was of some use to claimants, rather than having many claimants receiving small, limiting grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be remembered that increasing the number of individual grants would involve an obvious increase in administrative costs because of the greater work load in the processing of claims. Administration is built into the overall EMDG budget, so any increase in administration costs can only result in resources being diverted from where they belong&mdash;with the exporter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to mention some concerns raised by the book and publishing industries. I am personally disappointed with the government's obvious lack of consultation with these industries in relation to the effect of its amendments on associated companies. It has become obvious to the coalition that no regard was had by the government to the difficulties faced by the publishing industry and a number of other related industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the coalition supports the bulk of this legislation, I would like to stress that we will be keeping a close watch on how effectively this legislation is implemented in the marketplace to ensure that these industries are not subject to a decreased ability to access government assistance for their foreign market development. Given this lack of consultation, which should have been undertaken in the drafting of this legislation, it would seem the government's commitment to the arts has gone asunder and that it has scant regard for our publishers. If the Labor government is legitimate in its interest and understanding of the arts, it would have foreseen the anomaly this legislation contains. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about tourists who come from other countries, not from Tasmania, to Australia. When one looks at the energy costs of bringing those tourists into this country, one finds that those energy costs are not sustainable in the long term, and I believe that Australia is making a great mistake in encouraging tourism in that in the long run it will be shown to be a blind alley. We will make enormous investments in this industry which we will not, in fact, be able to realise and we should be thinking seriously about making those investments in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put some figures to that. Last year I was part of a parliamentary delegation which went to four southern African countries. The air travel was typical of tourists going from Australia to other countries or of tourists coming from places like Japan or anywhere in Asia, or indeed from Europe, to Australia. We travelled in a 747 and in the process of travelling I became very conscious of the fact that the energy I was using, the greenhouse gas emissions for which I was responsible, was greatly in excess of the greenhouse gas emissions which could be allowed under the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The panel thrice recommended limits which have to be placed on the use of fossil fuel. That very prestigious scientific committee recommends that we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent to 80 per cent as rapidly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give some official figures. In 1991 Australians used 3,722 x 10(15) joules&mdash;a joule being simply a unit of energy equivalent to one watt per second. To give an example, a 60 watt light globe uses 60 joules every second, or 216,000 joules per hour. If we divide the total energy used for the whole of Australia by the population in 1991, the reference year, we get an energy consumption of 213 billion joules per person. If we accept the best advice of the scientists who, as I say, have recommended on three separate occasions, updating their data, that we need to cut our fossil fuel by 60 per cent to 80 per cent, and allowing that Australians still have a relatively more profligate use of fossil fuels than others&mdash;I think that is morally indefensible, but even allowing that we cut our fossil fuel use by 75 per cent&mdash;then we derive a figure for the per capita use of fossil fuel by Australians in a greenhouse world of 50 billion joules per year as the allowable limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can quite easily work out, by looking at the energy consumption of aircraft, that on the African trip, in three weeks of air travel alone&mdash;irrespective of ground travel and all the other energy uses for which I was responsible&mdash;I used 89 billion joules.

That greenhouse gas is now in the atmosphere and will remain there, in terms of CO(2), for at least 60 years. So in travelling to Africa I have placed that greenhouse burden on every future Australian and every other person in the world. As Senator Parer said, there are three million people coming to Australian by air each year&mdash;99 per cent of them come by air, anyway&mdash;and the contribution which that makes to greenhouse gas emissions is enormous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My point is very simple: in making these very large investments in the tourist industry&mdash;building hotels, motels and roads, and investing in all the other infrastructure&mdash;we may well be going down a completely blind alley. Suppose in 10 years time that the evidence on greenhouse becomes absolutely incontrovertible and we decide as a nation to cut down our greenhouse gas emissions by that 75 or 80 per cent. Our investments will be absolutely hollow and unused because we will not be able to support the air travel which is necessary for those people to come to Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasing export earnings is of vital importance to the Australian economy, considering the burgeoning foreign debt and the current account deficit that the government has left us with. I have pleasure in supporting Senator Parer's amendments to this bill. They are directed at supporting coalition policy that all applications for EMDG grants for the tourist industry should be at an equal rate with all other EMDG applications. In supporting these amendments I acknowledge that the tourism industry is one of our greatest growth industries. It is playing a most prominent role in growth in my home state of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism contributes every year in export earnings $10.7 billion or 12 per cent of our total export earnings. The only way we are going to improve our current account deficit is through a supreme effort on the part of our exporting industries. When we think of our exports, our staple exports of primary industries must continue to feature high on the agenda. It is with concern that I must therefore refer to the plight of some of our smaller rural industries that are losing ground and, consequently, export growth and opportunities, through a combination of the damaging fallout from the GATT Uruguay Round and the government's inadequate attention to and consideration for their long-term future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned at the actions of the US government in signing the new World Trade Organisation agreement, increasing protection for its agricultural industries both directly and indirectly; and about the threat to Australian farmers from the 1995 US Farm Bill. ABARE has predicted that the Uruguay Round will result in major export earning increases of $1 billion a year for Australian primary industries&mdash;and we welcome that. The major beneficiaries are our beef industry, our dairy industry, sugar, rice and wheat. Beef exports are estimated to increase by $340 million; dairy exports by $320 million; wheat and grain by $410 million&mdash;if, with the inconsistent rain, we can ever get a crop&mdash;rice by $15 million; and sugar by $5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is extremely disappointing to see the response of the US in acting against the spirit of the round and, most significantly, the effect this will have on free trading Australian industries. The successor to GATT, the World Trade Organisation, came into being on 1 January; and within the same month the US has increased its dairy industry export enhancement program to allow US farmers to enter markets in a subsidised way and to secure markets in Asia which have been carefully cultivated by Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the end of January, the US government had approved subsidies of $565 per tonne for 3,000 tonnes of skim milk powder to the Philippines, 4,000 tonnes to Thailand and 1,100 tonnes to Malaysia. The subsidy allows goods to enter these markets at $100 a tonne below the current market price. The act of the US to secure markets in the six months leading up to the start of the World Trade Organisation agreement on 1 July will cost Australian producers&mdash;and, I might add, Australian export earnings&mdash;$20 million this year alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How revealing it was to discover that these subsidies in the main benefited large non-US corporations. We know that with enormous subsidies given by the US to the wheat industry, all the subsidies achieved was to lower world prices and displace its own sales into US existing markets. The massive million dollars in US subsidies increased the US market share by only two per cent, despite the waste of US taxpayers' money and the consequent hundreds of millions of dollars in losses to Australian grain growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite recent visits to Washington by Australian ministers and primary industry leaders to lobby about the 1995 US Farm Bill, it appears that the US is continuing to treat our concerns with contempt and will break presidential commitments to not damage Australia as a result of its export program. Soon after its signing of the Uruguay Round agreement, the US is increasingly implementing trade barriers which offend against World Trade Organisation provisions and agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US Farm Bill 1995 is due to be passed by the US congress by the end of this year, but amid pressure from US farmers for the continuation of export enhancement programs, including the extension of subsidies into the Asian market and the market development programs. Direct subsidies to US agriculture amount to $10 to $12 billion per year for commodities such as wheat, corn, rice and cotton as well as consumer transfers through higher prices for commodities such as milk and sugar. For example, milk support amounts to the equivalent of $9 billion per year, with $1.4 billion per year going to sweetener producers. Cane producers averaged $130,000 in subsidies in 1991&mdash;I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) is listening to this&mdash;with 33 of the largest sugar cane farms receiving $1 million each in that year. One farmer received a $30 million subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the GATT Uruguay Round, the United States undertook to reduce its subsidy exports. However, in 1994, US legislation adopting the Uruguay Round agreement export programs were extended to market development as well as retaliation against unfair trading practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US was quick to impose retaliatory 100 per cent tariffs against Japanese luxury car imports and resort to the World Trade Organisation in its trade dispute with Japan. When it comes to reducing export subsidies under international agreements, it seems that it breaks the international trade commitment with impunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hoped that the enormous and painful adjustment process undertaken over the last decade by Australian farmers in the name of success of the GATT Uruguay Round will return the anticipated benefits to our major export primary industries. Should the outcome of the 1995 US Farm Bill contravene the world trade agreement and affect Australian interests, the Australian government should take a stand and implement action in the World Trade Organisation to show its commitment to both Australian farmers and the new World Trade Organisation international rules on free trade. But, at the same time, export potential for many of our smaller rural industries is being curtailed as a result of unfair trading situations that remain in the wake of the Uruguay Round resolution and because of the absence of a fair go from this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interests of freeing up world trade, the Uruguay Round will implement a 36 per cent reduction in tariff rates, a 20 per cent reduction in domestic subsidies and a 36 per cent reduction in export subsidies over the next six years. It is a fact that, although subsidy levels will reduce over the implementation period of the next six years as most countries start from a very high tariff level, even at the end of the six-year period these countries will still enjoy a substantial trade benefit compared to our unsubsidised primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, Australian tariff levels stand at five per cent for most horticultural products, ensuring virtually free entry from overseas products into the Australian domestic market. Take citrus as an example. At the end of the six-year implementation period, the US will have a 40 per cent tariff rate in place, Brazil will still have a 35 per cent tariff, Israel will have a 120 per cent tariff, South Africa's will be 20 per cent and Japan's will be 25.5 per cent. This also means that these industries have had the certainty created by tariff support to invest and develop their citrus industries. </PARA>

Australian tariffs on egg products are at a negligible level, yet Canadian tariffs on egg products will only reduce over the next six years from 196 per cent to 167 per cent or from 94c per dozen to 80c per dozen. A new international free trade agreement may have been reached.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate when debating a bill directed at enhancing export performance that the impediments being placed in the way of good established industries growing into good export earning industries be discussed. If our pineapple industry, which this year is having to cut severely its intake from farmers, were to crack the export market in any significant way, it would have to face tariffs into Thailand of 60 per cent, 12 per cent into Canada and 24 per cent into the European Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the Uruguay Round, canned peaches and pears will still face tariff barriers of 15 per cent into Canada and 24 per cent into Europe.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US uses its export enhancement program to subsidise exports of US chicken meat. The world poultry trade is highly aggressive and corrupt. Recently, the US has used EEP to sell 200 tones of frozen chicken into Saudi Arabia with a subsidy of 96c per kilo, 137 tonnes to Oman and Bahrain at a subsidy of $1.09 per kilo, and 66 tonnes to Singapore at 79.5c per kilo. The EU has even a bigger subsidy on its poultry than the US through poultry being regarded as a processed cereal product and receiving the benefit of a 50 per cent cereal subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out these existing trade disadvantages that will continue over the implementation period of the Uruguay Round because of the effect that they have on our Australian industries. They introduce a period of unfair import competition for our industries, bring in lower returns and prevent growth and development of the industries.

Our potential export markets in industries that we have always performed well in must be under a very dark cloud of uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These small industries deserve a better deal from the federal government than what they receive.

The government's explanation for the difference is that the promotion by individual operators is intertwined with the generic promotion of Australia by the Australian Tourism Commis sion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993-94, 3.2 million tourists visited Australia. Foreign exchange earnings totalled $10.7 billion or 12 per cent of Australia's total export earnings. It is estimated that foreign tourists spend roughly $400 per head while visiting Australia, which is paid in the form of indirect taxes. So it is a very important industry and, as my colleague Senator Parer has announced in introducing the coalition's approach to this bill, the tourism industry is one which should be treated no differently from other industries. The coalition proposes a move to increase that grant to the same grant that every other industry receives; that is, to a rate of 50c in the dollar, rather than 25c in the dollar that the government is proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues who have spoken before me have gone through many of the arguments to support the increase in some detail. But, basically, the tourism industry, being such an important one, should be treated no differently from other industries which are eligible for the grant, so I will not proceed further with that. I think the case has been made very well by my colleagues who have spoken before me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do want to use this opportunity to say a couple of things about the tourism industry in North Queensland. It is an industry that will be helped by this grant. The region of Far North Queensland has been subject to over 50 strategies, plans and reviews over the last few years. There are 20 strategies on tourism alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these strategies that the Commonwealth government has funded include a $50,000 inventory on marine coastal tourism; a $50,000 wet tropics region ecotourism implementation strategy; a $10,900 pilot study for fringing reefs at Brampton Island; a $48,015 tropical coast tourism strategy; a $158,000 Cairns regional tourism strategy; a $25,000 Atherton Tableland tourism strategy; a $69,000 Cape York Peninsula tourism strategy and development plan&mdash;and that is on top of $11 million for a Cape York land use study; $40,000 on an Injinoo tourism strategy; $4 million on a strategic plan for backpackers&mdash;that was for all of Australia; and an inquiry into the impact of Australia's taxation regime on the tourism industry. If you add those up, you will see that that comes to over $4 1/2 million in funds spent on strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other strategies in the Far North Queensland area include the strategic plan for the Herbert shire, the strategic plan for Kuranda, and the Mulgrave shire tourism strategy. These are on top of an environment management charge review for commercial operators, and we have seen two of those very expensive reports tabled. There have been further reviews on funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one is questioning the need for detailed tourism plans for the North Queensland region. It is a unique and important region, competing with other much cheaper destinations in Asia and the South Pacific, not only for international tourists but also for the Australian domestic market. There have been some good strategies produced. In particular, the Cairns regional tourism strategy is one which has received extensive support from the industry in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the bulk of these strategies are never acted upon. They end up sitting on the shelf of some minister's office collecting dust. I wonder if the money spent on these tourism strategies and plans would have been more productively utilised marketing and promoting tourism in the region. Far North Queensland has been reviewed and strategised to death. It is time for some real action from the federal government in the form of marketing and promotions assistance to the small business tourism sector in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to raise another matter very briefly. The Department of Tourism, in its present form, does little to assist the tourism industry in Far North Queensland and in other regional areas of Australia. The department is centralised in Canberra and deals very much with general national tourism issues, producing broad-based reports and reviews which have little relevance or application to regional areas. The Department of Tourism spent $700,272 on consultancies in 1993-94 to produce reports, studies, surveys, reviews, et cetera&mdash;very few of which have anything of any use for tourism operators and the industry in Far North Queensland and in other regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I should make an exception there. There was one survey which was very beneficial, and that was the money that the government spent with ACIL on the proposals for a bed tax. It was good to see that at least the government did, with some pushing from Senator Parer and others, have a report done by ACIL on just what effect a bed tax would have on the tourism industry. The government did not proceed with that bed tax, so I can only assume that the ACIL report did make the government realise just how stupid its proposals were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department's staff has increased from 117 in June 1993 to 136 in June 1994. It seems, according to my information, that all of the staff are based in Canberra. The department is a growing Canberra based bureaucracy, and regional tourism, which is the future of tourism in Australia, is missing out on much needed assistance. Perhaps we need to consider whether some of the funds used for the Canberra based bureaucracy could not be better spent on promoting tourism in the regions. Perhaps more money should be spent on advising tourist operators on the availability of the export market development grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a previous speech I mentioned, and I think someone else mentioned it tonight as well, that the system of getting into the EMDG is quite complicated. One tourist operator told me that it cost him more in fees for lawyers and accountants than he actually got in the grant. So it is obvious that there are some steps needed to be taken to simplify that. Also, many tourist operators are not aware of the availability of the scheme. Perhaps some of the funds that are spent on less productive areas should be used to advise tourist operators of the availability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I congratulate the government on one decent program, the regional tourism development program, which has a $15 million annual commitment to regional tourism operations. It is a good scheme, unfortunately some of the areas that have applied for assistance have not received it. I mention particularly the Cairns to Forsayth railway line, which the local shire council was hoping to get some assistance for. That application was rejected in the first round. Nevertheless, the scheme is a good one and the government has been wise to introduce it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, money presently spent in less productive areas, such as the provision of more departmental staff here in Canberra, could be used to add to this scheme to make it more useful to Australian tourist destinations, many of which are in regional areas. I certainly support the amendment that Senator Parer will be moving. With that amendment, I, and the coalition generally, would support the bill before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall my remarks about the export market development grants scheme in the context of the Australian National Audit Office report No. 33 of 1993-94, an efficiency audit of the scheme managed by Austrade to provide taxable cash grants to assist Australian exporters in developing export markets. The two major issues I highlighted then were: the need for improved accountability to parliament; and the need for a greater measure of performance assessment. I raised those concerns again in relation to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1994. Those concerns remain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 [1995] seeks to extend the export market development grants scheme for a further four years. To me, that is probably the major issue and is the reason the Greens (WA) will vote against the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export market development scheme is problematic. While we know that an effort has been made to cut down on rorts and to allow small and medium enterprises some of the benefits handed to big corporations on a platter, this scheme remains part of the push for an export culture while ignoring the domestic economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stated in the context of the EMDG scheme that I hoped the government would consider improving the assessment of performance and the nature of the criteria used in that assessment. That has been done to a degree, and many of the efforts to reduce rorts are a result, but it seems that the quality of reporting to parliament, which was questioned in the Auditor's report, has still not changed markedly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that there is still a great deal less clarity than there could be, leading to many claims being disallowed or adjusted downwards. While this is not necessarily evidence of rorting, it requires significant input by staff and is evidence that the guidelines for claims are less clear than they could be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Performance measures are also difficult to assess and do not seem to be clear. While `return for dollar expended' gives some rough idea, it is a very rough idea indeed. There is no information about variation in this average. Do some dollars bring much greater returns? Do some bring little returns? Is there a breakdown of where and why good returns develop? Is information about where, how and why some expenditures give good returns while others fail to do so, effectively passed on to applicants?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other performance measures&mdash;such as numbers of grant applications, size, and distribution by industry&mdash;are good but not always easily available. Nor is there much information about things like why the number of grants declined from 1990-91, or what the increase in grants to companies providing financial or property services means. Is this about grants to insurance companies trying to expand? Is the increase in construction consultancy services due to grants for John Holland or Transfield to promote themselves in winning dam contracts? Is the community service increase due to grants for universities to promote educational services?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the scheme targets small and medium business, there is nothing other than expenditure limits&mdash;a limit of $25 million per annum in exports&mdash;to prevent larger companies from claiming. And there is nothing, as far as I know, to say that all expenditures must be claimed. There have been recent moves to prevent larger companies, groups of companies or conglomerates from lodging individual claims for all their effective subsidiaries. We have welcomed these moves but there is little information about the scope of such claims in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also stated that there is a need for the inclusion of other criteria relating to the environmental and social impact of both production and products used for assistance under this scheme. There is also the issue of equity and the subsidisation of undesirable goods and habits. This has largely been ignored, in spite of the ALP conference motion to ensure a code of practice for businesses operating in Asia. This should include businesses exporting to Asia. There should be an assurance of a code of practice or an examination of the environmental and social implications of exports and activities by exporting companies. A minimum case is that of taxpayers, through the government, actively supporting those companies and exports through the EMDG or some other scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason, we believe it is not appropriate to support the extension of this scheme. It is time to try to develop a new and better scheme&mdash;one with clear performance targets, one that is accountable, one that promotes environmental and social objectives, or at least explicitly considers environmental and social impacts. Either that or there should be substantial changes to the scheme to take on these considerations prior to extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us closes a few more rorts. It also makes the scheme more accessible to smaller business. That is good as long as the businesses themselves are not creating environmental and social problems. We are happy to see the changes that are here, and we would support those changes as we have supported such changes in the past if we were not opposing the scheme as a whole and pushing for much more fundamental change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats are proposing amendments to make the scheme even more accessible to smaller companies. We will support these amendments because our opposition to the bill as a whole is unlikely to result in its failure. The coalition is proposing amendments to strengthen benefits in general to the tourism industry. We have some concerns about those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that Senator Coulter has some concerns about the move towards increased support of tourism. Those concerns are based on the fact that exporting tourism means encouraging people to fly around the planet on holiday, which means more greenhouse emissions. That is something that concerns the Greens (WA) as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of tourism is problematic. It often depends on a nice clean environment and provides an alternative in many regional areas to major resource extraction projects. On the other hand, travel requires a lot of energy, usually used in an inefficient manner, and many areas of natural beauty threatened with being loved to death. While we can say that a good environment promotes tourism, it is not equally true that tourism promotes a good environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of whether to subsidise tourism generally is eclipsed by the question of whether government should be focussing support through this scheme at all. We hope that a new scheme, or a substantial change to this one, would result in environmental consequences, such as those of concern to Senator Coulter, being addressed effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Export culture remains the focus of the scheme and domestic industry continues to be ignored for being inconsequential. The basic issues we have objected to in the past&mdash;accountability and performance&mdash;continue to be inadequately addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last decade we have seen a great increase in the idea that commercial and trade objectives must be integrated with environmental and social objectives, such as overseas aid. Unfortunately, the thrust of sustainable development has been one-sided. Environmental efforts are expected to integrate economic considerations. AusAID seems to be turning into an adjunct of Austrade, the sharing, caring point of the trade and diplomatic sword. It is well past the time that some movement should occur in the other direction. It is time for trade to explicitly integrate environmental and social goals, and to become the cutting edge of a movement to protect and benefit the environment, the community and the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons, the Greens will not support the extension of this program. If efforts had been made to integrate a code of environmental and social responsibility and to improve the assessment of performance and accountability, it is likely that we would have supported it, in spite of other doubts about benefits. Without those efforts, especially with no measure to indicate that the government takes the social and environmental impact of our export dependence seriously, we cannot support the extension of this program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the government response to the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the implications of Australia's defence exports. After nine months gestation we have received the government's response to the Joint House Committee report. It is a pathetic response to a significant contribution by members of both houses and all parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only potential for effective, constructive change in the government's response is the acknowledgment that export of defence services, components and dual-use goods, non-lethal repressive equipment, and military type equipment used in civilian services is an issue which needs further examination. There is potential for constructive change, but I am now cynical enough about Defence to think that there is also the potential for such an examination to conclude that there are wonderful new markets and we should be promoting such exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from accepting these potentially, but only potentially, constructive considerations to further examine a few issues, the government has only accepted recommendations which either firstly, support keeping the responsibility for implementation and monitoring of defence exports firmly under virtually exclusive control of Defence; or secondly, reinforce the drive to promote defence exports or assist the defence industry and especially the defence export industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government appears to categorically reject any of the recommendations to assure greater compliance with export guidelines. The government says quite explicitly in response to recommendation 4.37 that it believes that it is doing a good job and business as usual is the best possible course. That is clearly not a conclusion of the committee&mdash;and I am talking about the majority of the committee now, not those, including several government members, who signed a much stronger additional report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am especially aggrieved that the government rejects the primary report recommendations 7 to 9. These were fundamental recommendations based on the committee's finding that Defence has far too dominant a role in monitoring exports and that humanitarian and diplomatic considerations are not being looked after adequately. The recommendations are conservative and only establish the links needed to facilitate Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade examination of export applications and ensure that DFAT can review applications to see what it believes is worth consulting with Defence about. Hardly radical!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended this action because there have been a number of occurrences&mdash;from the sale of Mirage jets to Pakistan to the proposed sale of Steyr rifles to various customers regionally&mdash;which have seemed inappropriate or dubious in terms of a normal reading of the guidelines. These decisions were taken without any formal consultation with either DFAT or SIDCDE&mdash;the inter-departmental standing committee. While several committee members did not go as far as those supporting the additional report, which called for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to have an independent veto on an export application, almost all members supported the need for DFAT to have a greater involvement in review at an earlier stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the rationale for this is the finding of the committee that the average turnaround time for applications was just four days and almost none of the applications, including very contentious ones, went to SIDCDE. In this case, review seems minimal and excludes DFAT entirely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A case in point is the application for export of sample Steyr rifles in bids for a very large contract to Thailand&mdash;a destination which would be considered diplomatically sensitive. No official approach was made to DFAT, SIDCDE, or any other inter-departmental committee, with the consequence that public comment on concerns by The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade resulted in diplomatic disturbances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation might have been avoided by referring the application to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade before bids were being made, with the support of the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Trade and, by association, full approval of the government. At the very least, if there was no problem DFAT could have satisfied itself that the Thai government was taking appropriate steps to prevent any unofficial transfers of weapons to the Khmer Rouge, and done so before it blew up into a diplomatic incident. The sale of Steyr rifles to Indonesia, a destination banned for small-arms exports by the United States, also apparently occurred without Foreign Affairs and Trade review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also essentially knocked back the recommendation that Defence improve the reporting of exports. The response given is hardly satisfactory. The first sentence, `Subject to improving the details of defence export reporting, the Government will investigate making the annual report even more informative', is virtually meaningless. It seems to say that if they improve the details of reporting, the government will think about including them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response to recommendation 11 on Customs is particularly disgraceful. The subcommittee was shocked and left with mouths agape at the revelation that Customs was effectively able to do little to police arms exports. The recommendation flows from the resulting concern. It did not praise the Customs service; nor, I believe, is it reassured by the recognition of the problem. It would like the problem remedied, and it would like to assure itself that the problem is remedied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the government response, one of the major issues that arose was that while Customs may be quite good at looking for smuggled fauna, when it looks at defence exports it has very little expert knowledge about whether what it is looking at corresponds to the docket saying what it should be. Customs basically ends up trusting the exporters. It is very telling that even the government response was prepared by Defence&mdash;not Defence and Foreign Affairs, or Defence in conjunction with Foreign Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak tonight on a subject which has been a concern to me for many months within this Senate and that is the whole issue of the Industry Commission inquiry into charitable organisations. I continue to receive from both small and large charitable institutions around this country records of their concern. They are wanting to be positive, but they are finding it very difficult to be so because they believe that the Industry Commission is not reflecting their concerns but rather, as we have seen in many other reports by the commission, reflecting its own ideological position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to refer to a letter and submission by the Sydney City Mission, one of the biggest charities in Australia and one that I believe has acted responsibly for many decades in its care of people and in its response to the social conditions under which people live in this country. In its letter to my colleague Senator Meg Lees, the Sydney City Mission describes itself as `a major community service welfare organisation which has made a number of presentations to the Industry Commission inquiry into charitable organisations'. It goes on to write:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Mission provides a wide range of services in the welfare sector and its expenditures for the current financial year will be in excess of $33 million.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not a minor industry, I am sure the Senate would agree. It continues:</PARA>

<PARA>It reminds the Senate in its letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Industry Commission is due to release its final report on the findings of the Inquiry into the Charitable Industry on June 16 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure whether that report has been released. I believe it has not yet seen the light of day. We look forward to seeing what the Industry Commission is going to say. The Sydney City Mission goes on in its letter to say that they wish to convey to the Democrats a number of concerns that the mission has about the outcome of the inquiry. There are two major concerns that I want to address tonight. One is its concern about the recommendation of the draft report to do with the tendering process and the other one is to do with fringe benefit tax. Under the heading of `The tendering process', the mission states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tendering process is one which has been part of the fabric of Australian society for many years. In most instances, it provides a realistic measurement of differences between a number of competing interests. There are some circumstances however, where the tendering process falls short in its measurement. One case in point relates to a "Meals on Wheels" service. The details are . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is very important that the Senate has the record of this because it is a very telling illustration of the problem that I have been trying to underline for many months in terms of the Industry Commission report. This is what the Sydney City Mission describes about this particular service. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Victorian "Meals on Wheels" service was won on tender by a commercial operation. As you would be aware, the Meals on Wheels service is all about providing a quality food service as well as providing a major daily communication point for the older people in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I might add that, having worked with many meals on wheels committees and knowing that my mother was one of the delivery people for many years, I understand the ethos of meals on wheels very well. The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commercial operation apparently fulfilled their contract admirably in terms of quality of food, but left a substantial gap when it came to a quality communication point. The commercial operation did not have time to communicate with their clients so one of the main ingredients of the Meals on Wheels service was lost. I'm sure there are other examples where clients have suffered by the impersonalisation of services as a result of the tendering process.</PARA>
<PARA>In terms of the fringe benefit tax issue, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to FBT issues, Recommendation 11.5 of the draft report is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"The Commonwealth Government should remove the Exemption from Fringe Benefit Tax for Public Benevolent Institutions".</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The Sydney City Mission would like to point out, as it does in its letter, that this could cause some very significant problems for similar services. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As pointed out in our submission, ". . . ..it is of prime importance that the Mission is staffed with the appropriate professional people. It is also important to balance the payment of this staff with the need to keep administration costs at the lowest possible level. . . . . . . By utilisation of the FBT exemption, the Mission is able to pay these professional staff half to two-thirds of the current market rate for a similar professional. Without the exemption, the Mission simply could not afford the quality of professional staff it now employs and without the professional staff the standard of accountability to the public, and more importantly, to our clients, would fall."</PARA>
<PARA>So honourable senators can see the problem that many of these institutions have with an ideologically driven report. Certainly before us at the moment is only a draft report and I suppose one could hope that the final report reflected the concerns which are being raised. But if it does not, then I certainly will reflect those concerns in this place and continue to do so. Perhaps I should close with just one other comment by the Sydney City Mission in its submission to the Industry Commission. It is to do with draft recommendation 16 (13.1). The recommendation reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government should fund the establishment of a pilot best practice program for the sector.</PARA>
<PARA>The mission, in its response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would not endorse this recommendation unless agreement was reached between the community services sector and governments as to the definition of "outcomes" and "benchmarks".</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is an underlying influence throughout the Draft Report that community service organisations do not strive for "best practice" in the delivery of their services. This assumption cannot be supported. Efficiency can and does exist outside the free market system. There is a commitment within community service organisations to quality outcomes for clients based not on a lowest cost price per unit approach, but on the principles of empowerment and self determination.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)-(5)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim that Australia's economic and diplomatic influence in Cambodia is declining and that Australian assistance to Cambodia, both past and present is not appreciated, is very wide of the mark.  From taxi-driver to King, Cambodians constantly demonstrate awareness of and appreciation for Australia!s role in the peace process and the very substantial contribution we continue to make to Cambodia's reconstruction efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media article to which Senator Newman referred in her question suggested that Malaysian companies are winning contracts in Cambodia at the expense of Australian firms. Malaysian companies have pursued opportunities in Cambodia very aggressively and successfully in the past six months. It is a positive development that Cambodia is now strengthening its ties with its immediate neighbours, including by seeking membership of ASEAN. Forging strong commercial ties is a perfectly natural part of that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would of course be a concern to Australia if contracts were awarded in Cambodia through processes which were not transparent and not in accordance with international norms. Australian views on the importance for Cambodia's international reputation and economic future of ensuring transparency in business dealings have been put very clearly to the Cambodian authorities and I am in no doubt that they have registered. In this respect, we ask for no more than a level playing field&mdash;certainly not for special favours. Equally, there is no doubt that Australian companies wanting to establish a foothold in Cambodia are able to draw on substantial reserves of goodwill towards Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that, as security problems ease and as the effectiveness of the legislative framework which is being put in place to encourage foreign investment is demonstrated, Australian companies prepared to do the hard leg-work will be able to benefit from this store of goodwill. In the end, it is up to the private sector to find out where the niches are and to act: some of our biggest and best firms, and a handful of smaller concerns, are doing precisely that at this moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's aid program is designed not to win contracts but to meet very real human needs in the health, education and rural sectors and to improve Cambodia's chances of taking its place as a stable and peaceful member of our region. The Government is strongly committed to the full implementation of our development assistance program of $92 million over four years&mdash;a program which is widely considered to be well-targeted and effective.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) 1114 staff have been identified as surplus to departmental employment requirements and placed on the Staffing Adjustment Program (SAP) and subsequently on the Career Transition Program (CTP) for six months of professional outplacement services. At the end of that period, if they have not already been redeployed nor have retired, they become formally excess under the provisions of the </PARA>

Of the 133 surplus staff from Australian Construction Services (NSW) 12 have lodged 23 Reg. 83 grievances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Of these 23 Reg 83 grievances, 17 have been resolved.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Reg. 83 grievance processes are not linked to identification and placement of surplus staff on or off the CTP, nor are those processes linked to continuing employment in the Australian Public Service. When surplus officers' periods on CTP expire and they are subject to the R&amp;R(R) Award, a further employment retention period of 7 or 13 months and voluntary redundancy options are provided under that award. Grievances lodged will be determined within these time frames.</PARA>
