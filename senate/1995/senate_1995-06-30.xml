<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate the fact that Mr John Sloan, an officer of the Department of the Senate, retired on 3 May 1995 after completing 40 years of service to the parliament. John Sloan commenced his parliamentary career with the Public Accounts Committee in May 1955 and he served that committee for nine years before he was appointed to the Department of the Senate in 1964, serving the Senate for a further 31 years under eight different presidents and six clerks of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John has been described by his colleagues as a person of great humility and personal integrity. He consistently displayed compassion and great understanding for senators and all parliamentary staff in the conduct of his duties. John has given his colleagues great joy, and many pleasant memories remain. His loyalty and dedication to the Senate and the institution of parliament remained constant throughout his 40 years of service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approaching his retirement, he requested that no departmental fuss be made over his departure, but it would be remiss of me as President of the Senate if his service to the Senate and parliament were to go unrecorded in this chamber. Former clerks of the Senate, Alan Cumming-Thom, Keith Bradshaw and Roy Bullock, have expressed their desire to be associated with these remarks, as have Lyn Barlin, Clerk of the House of Representatives, on behalf of his senior officers and other staff of his department who knew John well, and Michael Bolton, the Secretary to the Joint House Department, on behalf of his staff. I am pleased to be able to support the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, and all the staff of the Department of the Senate in their wish for John and his wife, Nancy, to enjoy a long and happy retirement with their children and grandchildren.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza, from the view of the administration of the Senate, I think it would be easier to have the matter established at this stage for planning purposes. I understand that there is general agreement around the chamber that this is a sensible procedure. No-one here wants to go beyond 3.45 p.m., but we do need to maximise the amount of time we have today, so the proposal is that the Senate sit during the lunch hour. From the point of view of the clerks and others involved in the administration of the Department of the Senate, obviously it would be useful to have this sorted out now.

If it is the wish of the Senate, without wasting any time on this, I will undertake to make sure that the whips in the Senate make the appropriate arrangements for the period that would otherwise be the lunch break. I think you can take that as read, Senator. We will ask the whips to coordinate that. That is a matter that can be easily worked through with the cooperation of all involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The motion I have moved indicates that today's hours of sitting are 9.00 a.m. to 3.45 p.m. We would all be very pleased if we faced the situation that Senator Ian Macdonald talks of. That would be a bridge we would have to cross if we came to it, but the answer, fundamentally, to his question is no.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition supports the amendment moved by the government to give the national principles for the intrastate distribution of federal local government funding the status of a disallowable instrument. This amendment achieves the same effect as an amendment moved by the shadow minister for local government, Mr Bruce Scott, in the other place, which the government defeated on a division on that particular occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am glad the government recognises the good sense of what the opposition was proposing in the House of Representatives and has now adopted the amendment as its own. I thank the Australian Democrats for their recognition at an early stage of the need for this amendment. This support has no doubt contributed to the government's change of mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objective of the amendment is very clear. The bill provides the federal minister with enormous personal discretion over the intrastate distribution of federal financial assistance to local governments. In the case of local road funding, the minister's discretion as to the interstate distribution of these funds is completely unfettered. The only limitation on the minister's power in respect of the distribution of general purpose grants is the requirement that the funds be allocated on a horizontal equalisation basis together with a minimum per capita requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the current draft of the national principles is similar to the arrangements already in place and, as I mentioned earlier in the second reading, have relatively little impact on the current intrastate funding distribution, the scope does exist in the legislation for the promulgation of principles which substantially alter this distribution. For example, depending on the criteria used, the result might be a shift in the rural urban split of funding or the allocation of funds on a regional basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real potential that at some indeterminate time in the future Ros Kelly's whiteboard will be dusted off and brought back into active service. In the past, an unrestricted power to determine principles has provided the federal minister with a role in the disbursement to specific councils of special reserve local road funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all these reasons, the coalition considers it appropriate that the principles should be a disallowable instrument subject to the full scrutiny of parliament. The government agreed to this arrangement at the local government ministers' meeting in October 1994 but failed to ensure it was incorporated in the original bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment will provide parliament with an opportunity to examine the principles and, if it has concern about their content, to pass a motion disallowing them. The notice of motion to disallow must be given within 15 sitting days after the principles have been laid before either house. This process promotes transparency in the allocation process and retains some parliamentary oversight of the distribution of $1.1 billion in federal financial assistance grants to local government provided annually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the bill is passed by parliament before 1 July to avoid the reallocation of local road funding which, under present legislation, will occur on that date.

As I indicated in the second reading debate, the bill already imposes a number of obligations on local councils without providing additional financial resources or any inbuilt strategy to assist with the meeting of those obligations.

We are not imposing something extra. We know that local government is involved in these issues, anyway. The act ends up being a vehicle by which these elements are excluded. That is extremely dangerous. It is not a valueless thing. It means that as a parliament you have imposed one set of values and you say, `These are more important than the others'. When you say `it should be left somewhere else', the mythical `somewhere else' is being pushed out.

That seems to be the least we can do.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 3 March 1994, the following matter was referred to the Committee of Privileges on the motion of the Deputy Chairman of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, Senator Vanstone:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether there was an unauthorised disclosure of a submission to the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, whether a contempt was committed by the disclosure, and whether there is any remedy for that disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter was referred as a result of a complaint to the National Crime Authority Committee by Mr L D Ayton that a submission he had made in confidence, under cover of a letter of 29 May 1991,  had been disclosed without authority, had been referred to in both houses of the South Australian Parliament, and had been tabled in the South Australian Legislative Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reference before the Committee of Privileges involved matters of high principle. The submission had been received by the NCA Committee in camera and its unauthorised disclosure was therefore proscribed under the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. In addition, public disclosure of the submission and the accompanying letter had occurred in both houses of a state legislature, under parliamentary privilege. The Committee, taking into account advice on this element of its reference, accepted that it was constrained in examining members of that legislature as to the source of the documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee had before it documents of the NCA Committee, setting out that Committee's attempt to discover the source of the disclosure. The NCA Committee received assurances from all members and staff of the Committee at the relevant time that they had not disclosed the documents, and also received a letter from the present South Australian Attorney-General drawing attention to the limitations on its examination of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding the comprehensive investigation by the NCA Committee, on receiving the reference the Committee of Privileges considered it necessary itself to attempt to discover the source. Accordingly, it sought and received advice from all members of the National Crime Authority Committee at the relevant time, and from the members of the South Australia legislature involved in the disclosure. It also sought information from a former journalist who, it was alleged in an anonymous telephone call to the NCA secretariat, had received the documents and had passed them to state members, and comment from the South Australian Attorney-General in the previous government, who had taken a continuing interest in the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All National Crime Authority Committee members denied knowledge of the disclosure. The South Australian Attorney-General, the Premier and the Deputy Premier of South Australia did not make substantive responses to the Committee of Privileges; and the journalist concerned denied that he had published the documents to any other person. The Committee believes it has exhausted all reasonable possibilities as to the source of the disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee regards the improper disclosure so seriously that it has decided to make a finding that improper disclosure of the submission and covering letter has occurred, and that this disclosure constitutes a serious contempt. It emphasises that it been unable to establish the source of the improper disclosure, owing particularly to the constraints on its capacity to examine members of the South Australian legislature responsible for publishing and referring to the two documents under the privilege of each House of the South Australian Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also recommends that, if the source of the improper disclosure is subsequently revealed, the matter again be referred to it, with a view to a possible prosecution for an offence under section 13 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. This Committee has never before taken the step of recommending that an offence should be prosecuted under the Parliamentary Privileges Act rather than through the Parliament's own contempt powers. The Committee considers the offence of such gravity, however, that action of this nature would be warranted.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether Dr Philip Nitschke was threatened with, or was subjected to, any penalty or injury on account of his evidence to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, and, if so, whether any contempt was committed by any action taken in relation to Dr Nitschke.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 20 July 1993, Dr Philip Nitschke appeared before the Senate Industry Committee and gave evidence on behalf of the Medical Association for the Prevention of War (MAPW) in relation to that committee's inquiry into disaster management. His evidence on behalf of the MAPW concerned the preparedness of the Royal Darwin Hospital for any nuclear accident. Dr Nitschke, who has a Ph.D in physics, was at the time employed as a Resident Medical Officer at the Royal Darwin Hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A brief account of the Senate Industry Committee's hearings was given on the ABC news at six o'clock that evening, and again at seven o'clock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On that same evening, that is, 20 July 1993, the Minister for Health and Community Services, the Honourable Mike Reed, issued a press statement, responding to the news item. In the statement the minister defended the RDH's approach to responding to radiation accidents. He went on to criticise Dr Nitschke's "continued attacks on Royal Darwin Hospital" and concluded with the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Dr Nitschke does not like the situation, I have no doubt that RDH will be able to scrape by without him.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 14 August 1993, Dr Nitschke advised the Senate Industry Committee that the press statement had disadvantaged him. He expanded on his concerns in a later letter, advising that he had been officially notified that he had not been selected for employment for the 1994 year&mdash;a decision without precedent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Industry Committee considered the matter and the Committee of Privileges received the reference on 18 November.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As in all matters of this nature, the issue the Committee was required to determine was complicated by the climate in which the incident had occurred, involving in particular the relationship between Dr Nitschke and other Resident Medical Officers, on the one hand, and senior hospital and health administration on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has examined a substantial number of documents, most of which have been tabled with this report, and has heard evidence from relevant parties. During its hearings, the Committee received certain original documents. Following Senate consideration of this report, the Committee intends to seek authority from the Senate to return the original documents to the Northern Territory Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After due consideration of the evidence, the Committee has not been able to establish sufficient connection between Dr Nitschke's appearance before the Senate Industry Committee, and his failure to be offered a contract following first round consideration of Resident Medical Officer appointments to the RDH for 1994 and subsequent events, to make a finding that any contempt of the Senate was involved. The formal finding contained in paragraph 2.36 of the report reflects this conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has, however, made critical comments about the administrative handling of this matter. The Committee continues to emphasise its concern about organisations' overreaction to public comment by officers and emphasises again, as it has in previous reports, that all public servants have the civil right to participate in matters of community interest provided that their private participation is not in conflict with statutory obligations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following is a brief history of events which are pertinent:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.I was appointed by the Whitsunday Shire Council as Shire Clerk in September 1992, commencing duties on 16 November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.I was selected from 45 other applicants for the position and I was the only woman applicant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.I am a qualified Municipal Clerk and have been since 1971. I hold the Clerk's Certificate for Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. I am a member of the Institute of Municipal Management, member of the International City Managers Association and hold a Continuing Programme Development Certificate. I have been awarded by the Institute of Municipal Management two overseas study fellowships; one was to study office automation extensively throughout the USA and the other was to study occupational health and safety legislation throughout Australia and New Zealand. I have also studied garbage disposal throughout China with the Australia China Foundation Society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.I have held various positions in Local Government since 1971: Chief Administrative Officer, City Accountant for 7 years, Deputy Town Clerk for a period over 11 years; assisted the Chairman of the Local Government Commission in Melbourne in relation to research into feasibility studies of amalgamation proposals of councils, and more recently Shire Clerk and Chief Executive Officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My principal employers have been the City of Collingwood in Victoria&mdash;17 years, the Local Government Commission, Victoria&mdash;4 years, the Shire of Narrabri, New South Wales&mdash;approximately 2 years, and the Whitsunday Shire Council from November 1992 to the present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The above is a list of all my employers since commencing my career in local government. My position has never been terminated prior to 12 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A brief account of events between 1992 and the present will I believe assist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shortly after commencing with the Whitsunday Shire Council I was required to investigate the disappearance of the pecuniary interest register. This investigation included internal investigations and led to police investigations culminating in my alerting the Criminal Justice Commission in my capacity as Shire Clerk. Whilst this matter was ultimately resolved it precipitated the beginning of political, administrative and internal problems which have plagued me ever since.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been ongoing and continuing contact with the Criminal Justice Commission (C.J.C.) over a number of matters during my period of employment. The matters which were reported to the C.J.C. all related to pecuniary interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The series of events mentioned above culminated in four councillors moving to terminate my position on 12 July 1993. What followed was industrial action, intervention by the Criminal Justice Commission, Minister for Local Government, the Attorney-General and other legal intervention which is still ongoing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.On 18 November 1993 Senator Ian Macdonald said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The council voted, for reasons I will not go into, to dismiss the shire clerk because members of the council were not able to work with her, and for other reasons". (Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, p. 3121)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This comment is damaging to my reputation. This is particularly so when it is read in the context of the speech as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.On 28 June 1994 Senator Ian Macdonald again referred to the matter (Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, pp. 2186-2188).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe that the Senator's version of the circumstances is an accurate reflection of the situation. The revealing of the content of the affidavits by my opponents prior to the court hearing has been damaging to me personally and professionally. It has been an attempt to prejudice my position but it does not reflect the extraordinary circumstances that existed at work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The speech on 28 June 1994 has given an opportunity for a local paper to publish the transcript verbatim from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It took two full pages on 6 July 1994, all page 1 and 3. There was also a front page Editorial on 13 July 1994. This exercise is particularly interesting when it is known that one of the persons who gave an affidavit along the lines mentioned was the Editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whitsunday Times</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The allegations against me are without basis in fact. The publication of the material has had direct detrimental impact on me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By making the affidavits of my opponents public it has no doubt affected the public perception of my professional credibility and has done irreparable damage to my future career in local government or indeed any future employment prospects I may have had. The affidavits referred to portray a completely different situation to that which pertained at work, the seniority of my position and the extent and degree of my responsibility as the Shire Clerk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have high moral expectations and am an extremely hard working individual. I find the insinuations totally offensive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Ian Macdonald's remarks in relation to my general competence and unwanted sexual advances were completely unnecessary and unwarranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The comment "dispute between elected councillors and the Shire Clerk" implies that there was a problem between "all" councillors and the Shire Clerk. This statement is not true. The Shire Clerk had the support of 5 of 9 councillors and all indoor and outdoor employees, as well as a good part of the community. This was witnessed by "all" employees going on strike etc. Therefore, reference to the "council" when the council was so divided is misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reference to the campaign of smear and innuendo is exactly what these ex-councillors are doing to me . . . the opportunity that Senator Ian Macdonald has given these persons by revealing their affidavits in the Senate pre-empts the decision of the court. Indeed even though the court may find in my favour the adverse, negative publicity has irrevocably damaged my credibility, and caused exceptional private hardship financially, emotionally, physically and socially. The statements by Senator Ian Macdonald are incorrect and the publication of his speech in the local paper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whitsunday Times</EMPHASIS>, is damaging to my proven reputation as an honest and hard working person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the period March 1994 to May 1994 negotiations between council and my solicitors continued in relation to settling outstanding matters. The transcript of the Senator's speech in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whitsunday Times</EMPHASIS> inflamed the situation, new councillors were embarrassed, it tarnished their view and alienated them in some way which was apparent in the manner some of them spoke to me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In carrying out my duties I did no more or less than any other person in my position was required to do according to law. It is my impression that one reason I was appointed was because certain councillors felt that they could "bully" me to be a "rubber stamp" rather than what was required from a professional Shire Clerk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summing up, Senator Ian Macdonald has no personal knowledge of this council's procedures or operations. He does not know me personally, nor has he had discussions with me. He has no direct knowledge of my performance as Shire Clerk. He has relied on biased opinion and secondhand information. No attempt has been made to substantiate the allegations levelled against me mainly by former councillors who were subsequently not elected at the last council elections held in March 1994.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have no objection to the government amendments. I just wish to raise a couple of points that came up in discussions on the Customs, Excise and Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, and I refer to the submission presented to the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs by the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties. The council was concerned to ensure that, whenever body searches are undertaken, people are informed of their legal rights. I understand that there are provisions in the legislation, but very often it has been found that the customs officers concerned with the implementation have not been fully trained and are not fully aware of the procedures that they should be following.</PARA></TALK.START>

These rights include that the person has the right to refuse consent to the search, the person has the right to have the matter of a personal search referred to a judicial officer, the person has the right to insist that he or she be examined by a person of his or her own sex and, in the event that the search is a cavity search, the person must have the search conducted by a qualified medical practitioner. The Australian Democrats urge the government to ensure that, when these provisions that are the subject of this amendment bill are put into implementation, the staff of the department are properly informed and trained to observe the conditions that are imposed in these areas. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 22 May a working party was formed in Canberra to prepare customs officers for the new search and seizure legislation. Members of the working party were drawn from central office, regions and the CPSU. Part of the working party's responsibility was the preparation and delivery of training programs to ensure that all relevant staff were equipped to use the new legislation and given adequate training in its provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional training commenced on 19 June and consisted of, firstly, in-depth one- and two-day training packages targeted at those officers likely to use the new provisions on a regular basis and, secondly, an awareness package for staff who may have some peripheral contact with the legislation. There is an ongoing commitment to the training of staff after the enactment of the new legislation&mdash;particularly for those officers identified as belonging to areas where the use of search and seizure warrants is required. An awareness video is also being prepared to assist with this training. To date, 279 customs officers have been provided with in-depth training, and a further 321 customs officers provided with awareness training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs officers from all regions, with the exception of the Northern Territory, have received training.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 24-hour help desk has been established to provide expert assistance to customs staff on the application of the new draft legislation. Operational areas, including Northern Territory staff, can utilise the services of the help desk to ensure correct interpretation and receive clarification as necessary. Initially, the help desk will operate nationally out of Canberra but, as regional expertise develops, this responsibility will be taken over by the investigations branch in each region. The Customs Service has responded very strongly&mdash;and with my strong encouragement. It is not just a matter of carrying the legislation; it is a matter of the officers being trained so that the procedures are clearly understood, particularly the very sensitive matters of people being asked to comply with strip searches, body searches or internal searches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedure leading up to someone being requested to take part in an internal search is extremely thorough. It does involve a check that it is not just a capricious decision of some staff member to say, `We would like to conduct one of these sorts of searches.' I can assure you, Senator, it has always been at the back of my mind that, as far as possible, there should be correct, simple, step-by-step procedures that can always be evaluated and monitored to ensure that the rights of individuals are protected to an extent that is acceptable in a modern society, within the context that we want to protect the borders of Australia from the importation of illegal and prohibited products and material. </PARA>

With the establishment of the help desk, as I described, that is putting into procedure what has been the practice.

Under the government's bill, you are omitting out of the Customs Act paragraph 164(1)(b), which deals with the definition of `residential'. The Democrat's amendment which we have just agreed to would add to the clause the words `at residential premises'. What we want left in are the words `at residential premises to generate electricity for use in'. If this amendment is not carried, there will be no amendment in your bill to allow that to be added.

<PARA>Amendment 7 will extend the definition of `items rebatable' under the residential rebate to remote generating stations which may be operated on a commercial basis.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated in the second reading debate, we are concerned that the push for cost recovery will strongly disadvantage rural communities. This amendment is a partial method of addressing this.

This would be commercial under the current definition of `residential rebate'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to non-government organisations which have spoken to us, some remote communities do not get a rebate and so use fuel oil in an attempt to reduce costs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes Greens amendment No. 7. We oppose it because it would uphold the recent AAT decision&mdash;what is called the Cowell Electric decision. The Greens amendment, if it were carried out, would substantially extend the provisions of the diesel fuel rebate scheme way beyond what it was envisaged for. Senator Margetts, you are trying to extend the scheme, which may be what you want to do, but I think that senators should understand that, were your amendment to succeed, existing electricity companies, state authorities, which run diesel generating operations in remote areas as part of their activities would get a rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For various obvious reasons, state governments have often directed those authorities to pay a subsidy because of the disadvantage of those mainly remote areas&mdash;they have subsidised the provision of that electricity. I will tell you what would happen: they would then take the rebate and reduce their subsidy. In effect, you are proposing to the federal government that we take on the subsidisation of what the states are already doing as part of their program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is what you want, that is fine, but let us make sure that you and the Senate understand that we would then be setting up a system whereby effectively we would be taking over the subsidisation provided by state electricity authorities by providing the diesel fuel rebate for the generation of electricity in these remote and rural towns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator, I can think of half a dozen places in my own state where rebate under your amendment would be paid. There are many in North Queensland, in Western Australia and in New South Wales. I have not got a comprehensive list across the board because no-one has ever drawn up the list, but my knowledge and experience with this scheme leads me to believe that the list will turn out much bigger than you or I would envisage. We would then find state electricity generating authorities starting to make real arrangements by saying, `This is a free kick for us. We will actually switch to using more diesel generation because we will get the rebate, and that will be cheaper than other forms of generation of electricity.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that we should make distorted decisions about electrical generation by diesel fuel vis-a-vis any other fuel. That is what the impact of your decision would be. This is very hard for us to estimate, and I do not want to overestimate or underestimate it. My officers, since Senator Margetts has suggested this amendment, have tried to work out what they think the cost would be. Their estimate now is that approximately $35 million extra would be going into the scheme. This is an outlay over and above the existing scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be Senator Margetts' view that that is an excellent thing to do but, if we want to subsidise or help remote towns, then quite frankly that is a different debate regarding general regional development issues. This scheme was never designed to provide assistance for electrical generation to all of the remote towns of Australia. Senator Margetts may say that that is a very good idea and I may not disagree with her if she is dealing with a particular allocation that might go through under regional development but, to keep extending the diesel fuel rebate scheme in the way that she is proposing will, in the end, destroy the rationale and the scheme itself. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the very beginning the rationale for the scheme, overwhelmingly, was that it was to be directly associated with agriculture, mining, fisheries and forestry. Senator Margetts is suggesting that remote towns, no matter what they use the power for, should have access to the rebate&mdash;that is the impact of her amendment. That will increase the outlays by $35 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the opposition and to the Democrats that, if they are consistent about saying that government expenditure must be reduced and outlays must be brought down, they cannot support the Greens' amendment because this will increase outlays by at least $35 million. We are not talking about $1 or $2 million here; we are talking about at least $35 million. I suspect that that is an underestimate because in the past, whenever one thought a small change was being made by a court decision, it has ended up being used to crowbar out the whole wall so that a bus could drive through and collect all the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think the Greens' amendment will extend the scheme much more than is envisaged. I do not think this should be done because in the end it will destroy the scheme. That may be Senator Margetts' long-term objective; I do not know. It is not the government's objective; we want this scheme to be directed at agriculture, mining, fisheries and forestry in accordance with the existing rules. We are clarifying them; this will extend them, so we strongly object to this amendment. </PARA>

It also occurs to me that the mess we are trying to deal with in the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and the Customs, Excise and Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 may well be related to the fact that we were still hearing until just before the budget that there was the possibility that the mining diesel rebate would be adjusted downwards.

<PARA>The first point I want to make about this amendment is that it relates to the off-road component of the backloading operation. It is part of a practice that has been in existence for many years in agriculture so it is not an extension of the current scheme. It existed before 1982 and has existed since. It has been a component of the claims agricultural people make for the diesel fuel rebate, particularly in pastoral areas where there are many private roads and many kilometres covered. It is important as an efficiency measure and environmentally because one truck, one operation, does the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be absolutely crazy for the government to knock off or defeat this amendment because it would interfere very greatly with that arrangement. It would create a situation where pastoralists, in particular, but farmers in general, would be forced to make a decision so they could protect their diesel fuel rebate for the outward journey. They would get another operator to operate in the other direction. </PARA>

I wish to comment on the fact that lime is backloaded for the beneficiation process at a beneficiation plant. It is well and truly customary for all trucks to cart fuel back to the mine when they return from the beneficiation operation. When they go into remote areas and there is a strip, they put avgas on the back of a truck and cart it back without jeopardising their position with the diesel fuel rebate off public roads or on private roads. </PARA>

To begin with, the two cases that he raised are not applicable, nor are they relevant in terms of this amendment we are putting forward. I would re-emphasise very strongly that this is custom and practice which has occurred in agricultural and pastoral pursuits. The cases that the minister raised related to the railways. We make it quite clear in amendment No. 20. Subparagraph (gb) of this amendment says `to the agricultural property'. No train goes to an agricultural property. We also make the point in this amendment&mdash;and we are very careful with the wording&mdash;about raw materials or consumables: once again, transported to the property for use in the core agricultural activity. It is not an extension. You cannot carry it back and cart it to your neighbour.</PARA></TALK.START>

But I certainly do not accept it as being an extension of the scheme with regard to practice and custom. We cannot include this as an amendment in terms of going back to 1982, although the fundamental landcare scheme did start in Western Australia in about 1981.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government cannot support this amendment. I think Senator Spindler has already acknowledged that this is a clear extension of the scheme.

Providing the diesel fuel rebate may not be the most effective use of the dollars involved. With the $20 million or $30 million, we may be able to achieve a much more effective outcome for the environment than by providing cheap diesel. That is the issue. You asked how we would do it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next issue is the catchment area. You could end up with a definition that the whole of Australia is a catchment area. Is the Murray-Darling basin, under the legislation establishing the Murray-Darling Commission, a catchment area? In that area are agricultural land, Crown land and national parks automatically eligible for rebate for any activity by a Commonwealth authority or a state authority such as the department of wildlife or the department of conservation?

If there were areas where there were specific government enticements and encouragement for people to be involved specifically in landcare activities in catchments, then maybe we would not have the revolting mess that we have in the Murray-Darling basin.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last few days we have debated competition policy and have been told, `No, this is not the place for the environment.' We have debated local government legislation and have been told, `No, this is not the place for the environment.' We have a piece of legislation dealing with agricultural activities and land care and Minister Schacht says, `No, this is not the place for the environment either.' I presume the minister means the place for the environment is the environment committee. I note that the government and the opposition do not take a lot of notice of the issues that environment committees tend to come up with. They say that is not about the real things in life; that it should be about the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that in EPAC surveys people in Australia say that government should be spending more money on the environment. They expect that the decision makers in this land will be prepared to integrate environment policy at all levels. The Greens and the Democrats are not suggesting that diesel is a preferred fuel, but if another piece of legislation comes up about another aspect of land care we will be in there batting for that aspect as well. We are told that it is not here and it is not there. Where do we find where the government is integrating sound environmental policy into its policies? If it is anything to do with the economy, local government or competition policy, the answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have something specific, and it is not here either.

It is perfectly legitimate to put it in here, and I acknowledged at the start of the debate that it is an extension of the scheme.

It is limited to a person who carries on a core agricultural activity on the agricultural property where the core activity is carried out or at a place adjoining or in the proximity of that place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will not be supporting the coalition's amendment. I would like to quote some words of Mr Justice Kitto in a 1955  case where he said that the two activities, quarrying and mining, can be very distinctly differentiated. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would, I think, be unusual to apply the word `mine' to open diggings for the obtaining of stone of a kind which does not call up, by association, the idea of mining in the sense of sinking a shift and tunnelling in pursuit of a desired substance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This definition of mining does not include quarrying operations carried on for the sole purpose of obtaining stone for building, road making or similar purposes.</PARA>

There is a whole range of cases in which the courts have decided that quarrying is not mining: the New South Wales Associated Blue Metal Quarries case, the North Australian Cement case, the Sanders Quarries case and at least one of the Neumann dredging cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe it is difficult in this legislation, as I have said before, to find a rationale for when the rebate should be applied and which industries it should apply to. The legislation so far has concentrated on mining and agriculture. One of the justifications for picking out those two industries is that both of them are export industries, essentially and substantively, and that, for our economic well-being, we are intent as a nation to give every assistance we can in the global competitive environment to industries which do assist in this effort.

It would certainly be confined to that period of time after approvals were given for the development of the mine until the actual mining operation took place.

But, in this case, that is a bit silly because there are often very good reasons, and legislative reasons, why you cannot have a tailings dam or other such mechanisms right near the mine&mdash;they are often safety or environmental reasons, or the reason may be the sheer size of a tailings dam. Therefore, if you have `adjacent to' in this particular instance, it really does limit&mdash;as Senator Spindler suggests&mdash;the application in a rather bizarre way. The Greens (WA) would support `in proximity to the mine'. Otherwise, your definition may well mean a court case in the other direction, which will mean that rehabilitation activities are not covered simply because the tailings dam by law is away from the mine.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Amendment 15 deals with mining and the definition of `mining town'. The opposition wishes to omit the words `in an area where there was previously no town' from the definition. The government's position is to limit the town to an area where there was previously no town, and we are concerned about this. We believe that a mining town is simply a mining town for the purpose of the act. Under the government's bill, the situation could arise whereby it could be decided to place a new mining town on the site of an old ghost town, but this would not be a mining town under this definition because it is in or at the place where there was previously a town, regardless of whether or not the town is usable or safe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of `mining town' should be left as it exists with regard to state agreements and the establishment of a mining town. As I am sure you are aware, you cannot establish a mining town without a state agreement to set it up, because it is a private contract between that particular mining company and the state government. We are moving to amend that particular part of that definition to omit `in an area where there was previously no town', because we believe that establishing a town is covered under existing laws on the requirements to establish a mining town. That could be restrictive, particularly for mines that were operated back in the late 1800s and early 1900s that have now been reopened and, with modern technology, are now operating as proper ongoing commercial operations. There are quite a number of such situations now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes the amendment. By removing this clause, it means that any existing towns can then start, under the arrangements, claiming diesel fuel rebate by meeting other conditions. This definition has already been upheld by the court as the major definition to define those towns that are eligible for the rebate. If it is removed, a whole range of other towns already in existence, which may have only some parts of mining attached to it but are not specifically for mining, would then be in a position in one way or the other to start claiming rebate. Again, this is an extension of the scheme that the government does not support.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is not a public town, it is a private town and it has to be set up under an agreement through an act. In terms of the previous answer, can the minister point out how a town can suddenly become not previously a town? What Senator Margetts says is absolutely accurate. It relates back to the situation where we are finding what were mining operations with quite thriving towns back in the 1850s to 1900s, but people have not lived there since. It says quite clearly in an area where there was previously no town. Can the minister explain to us how that is covered?</PARA></TALK.START>

That is what automatically would be eligible for the diesel fuel rebate under the definition. What has beenble member have put in makes it a much broader definition of a town. We know his intent is correct. We think the intent is well and truly covered by what we have, because that is how it has been operating now and how it will continue to operate under this provision. If the meaning is broadened, we think people will start arguing that, when a further addition was made to what is already a well-established town, quite substantial existing towns would be eligible for the diesel fuel rebate, although it is not a specific mining town developed to meet mining development.</PARA></TALK.START>

This comes in under the proposed definition of a mining town. One cannot just go in and start something up or call it a mining town. There are certain procedures that have to be gone through. I cannot see how the words `in an area where there was previously no town' can be confusing. It is crystal clear. There cannot be a town there. That is what the minister's position says. If he thinks we are broadening it too far, we might add something like these words to the end of it, although they do not solve it: `in an area where there was previously no viable or safe town'. The reality is that there are mines reopening where there were towns back between 1850 and 1900. The government amendment to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 would stop absolutely dead the formation of a mining town there as far as the diesel fuel rebate was concerned.

What we have here is a range of court cases which are under appeal. To save the time of the Senate I will not run through them again. I have mentioned them previously. Suffice it to say that the Neumann Sands case is on appeal to the Federal Court by the government, and the Nunawading City Council is appealing to the Federal Court against the decision that affects them. It is quite clear that we are in a situation of see-sawing legal definitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the point of whether people have taken action in reliance on what they believe the law to be, we have not had any evidence at all that those people that believed they might have a right to obtain a rebate have in any way reduced their charges or the costs to their customers; nor have we received any commitment by any of these bodies, should they be successful at any future stage, to return to the end customer any of the benefits that they are seeking to obtain for themselves. We have here an attempt promoted by accountants and lawyers&mdash;by commissioned agents&mdash;to obtain benefits out of the public purse and to channel these benefits to people who believe they have found a legal loophole. That is really what we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a manoeuvre that is rather unsavoury, because we are talking about an amount of $160 million to $190 million. We are talking about that amount being extracted from the public purse to be channelled to people as a windfall profit, not in the normal course of their business transactions, and not as a result of decisions that they have made which now would disadvantage them. What we are being asked to do is to pass legislation which will provide a retrospective benefit. Let us call it by its proper name. It is a retrospective benefit that is now being asked for, and in that sense the term `retrospective' is well and truly justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the substance of this&mdash;when we look at $160 million to $190 million which would be syphoned out of the public purse&mdash;we should remind ourselves that $170 million is enough to provide nearly 400,000 person days of hospital care; that it is enough to build 300 new schools; that it is enough to clean up our polluted beaches many times over. Yet we get arguments here in the chamber that we should provide that retrospective benefit on the basis that some people thought their lawyers were finicky enough and clever enough to gain them an advantage in the court. The Democrats will not be part of it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler can use whatever words he likes but the Democrats have taken their position in this debate because they are concerned that the government might give them a hiding in the public arena by blaming them for a fictitious increase in interest rates.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be seeking leave to table some documents comprising a number of letters which, I think, most of us have seen.

They deal with the four court cases to which I referred. They also recognise what the opposition is trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is taking a consistent position. We have to look at the intent of the legislation before and since 1982. Prior to 1982 the main difference in the operation of the diesel fuel rebate scheme was the use of a certificate number. The system was changed to a rebate scheme because a number of fuel stations did illegal deals with the certificates but, in essence, the idea is the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to cover&mdash;I am not a lawyer but I can think a little bit&mdash;is the concept that you are giving back taxpayers' money. If the customs department is holding what is rightfully yours in law and refusing, in the face of Federal Court decisions, to pay it back&mdash;as has happened in these cases&mdash;the department is holding the individual's money, not taxpayers' money. The argument we have heard from Senator Schacht and Senator Spindler is totally spurious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was amazed, particularly after what went on last night, which will be a blight on this place for a long time, that the government can continue to run this line. In this case, Boral, Pioneer and CSR have a particular right, as has been determined by the Federal Court four times. Once a court has made its decision, what right does the customs department have not to abide by it? Surely, if we have any honour or decency, we must live by the fundamental principle that a court decision must be accepted. The individuals involved have the right to appeal a decision by going to the highest court in the land. But just to decide not to abide by a decision, as the government is doing in this case, is abhorrent. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">then, for the purpose of those proceedings, despite section 8 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</EMPHASIS>, the law governing the right to be paid such a rebate is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Customs Act 1901</EMPHASIS> as in force on and after that day and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Excise Act 1901</EMPHASIS> as so in force.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the appearance of our companies at the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on Friday, it has come to our attention that the concept of `windfall gains' requires further explanation in the context of rebate claims made by our companies and relating to the industrial minerals sector. The issue as it applies to this sector needs to be divorced from matters relating to parks and gardens and other matters. Pertinent to these matters are issues already raised in prior correspondence which are not repeated here.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dealings with Customs</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be remembered that all the operations involving extraction of industrial minerals were covered by the diesel exemption scheme right up to 1982. Once the new scheme was introduced, negotiations with Customs commenced as to the eligibility of certain industrial minerals and it was generally accepted that silica sand, general sand and limestone were covered by the scheme. Claims on these minerals were lodged and paid from the inception of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The treatment of other minerals was the subject of on-going consultation with Customs, resulting in legal action in the late l980s, in relation to the eligibility of clay, black granite and certain beneficiation operations in relation to limestone. Although the decisions in those cases were handed down in the late 1980s, as you can well imagine a significant period of time lapsed prior to the actual handing down of the court decisions, during which there was extensive consultation with Customs, preparation and lodgement of the claims, preparation and conducting of the hearings and delay in delivery of judgement. One of these cases involved a company in the Boral Group (Boral Bricks).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following these decisions, Customs agreed to pay rebates in respect of clay and black granite, as well as sand and limestone, but continued to refuse to do so in respect of other industrial minerals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the interim, the decision of the AAT in Neumann Dredging was handed down in 1986, and on appeal to the Full Federal Court in 1987. In that case, dredging operations were undertaken for the purpose of increasing the depth of the river and the dredged sand was used for landfill. The mineral qualities of the sand were of little consequence and the Federal Court rightly concluded that the activities did not constitute mining operations. From that time, Customs mistakenly applied that decision to the effect that all sand extraction did not qualify for rebate. It is understood that Neumann Sands commenced negotiations with Customs as regards sand excavation for the mineral content of the sand and it was not until 1994 that the Neumann Sands case was actually heard by the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It can be seen from the above synopsis that this is not a matter of the companies having `sat on their hands' and not taken action, as has been claimed by Senator Schacht.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allied to the above is the fact that claimants are generally reluctant to take court action against Government bodies (for fear of retribution and reasons of cost). Having brought four successful cases in seven years, it must be wondered how many more cases are required before Customs will commence giving effect to court decisions in its day-to-day administration. Customs refusal in this regard continues a long line of practice, publicly evidenced in a number of instances, most recently in the Midford paramount matter. As Justice Davies was moved to comment at the very outset of a 1989 Federal Court case:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It has been rumoured for some time that the Collector of Customs has been reluctant to give effect to decisions of this court and of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and of this court, reluctant to change a decision once made, and reluctant to give practical effect in monetary terms to a decision of this court or of the Tribunal which is contrary to a decision of the collector." (Collector of Customs v LNC (Wholesale) Pty Ltd (1989) 11 AAR 76)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such practice is also evidenced by the fact that following the Neumann Sands decision Customs has paid rebate to the one claimant. Neumann Sands (refer Senate Estimates Committee p.E43, copy attached). In respect of identical sand operations for our companies, Customs has continued to refuse payment. Do claimants need to take legal action in respect of every similar sand operation in the county before Customs will acknowledge the eligibility of those operations?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Business Decision-Making Process</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question arose at the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on Friday as to the manner in which the companies have treated the expected rebates in their budgeting and pricing calculations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The answer to that question is simple: to the extent that Customs had agreed that rebate was payable (ie in respect of clay, limestone and black granite), the companies did include the rebate in their budget and pricing calculations. In respect of other industrial minerals, where the companies have obtained advice that rebate was payable but where Customs' policy has been that such activities are ineligible, the companies have not done so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The answer to this question, however, needs to be understood in the context of the caution which underlies all business decision-making. It would be a very brave (and possibly foolish) businessman indeed who would budget on the basis that a rebate would be payable where the policy of the Government body concerned was that the rebate was not payable. In these circumstances, no matter how strong the legal advice, there is no certainty as to the obtaining of payment, and particularly as to the timing of the receipt of the payment and the lengths (and therefore costs) which will need to be undertaken in obtaining payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of this, however, does not detract from the fact that the companies have believed that an entitlement has existed for some time and have been mindful of such an entitlement in the general operation of their businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact of the matter is that the companies have a legal entitlement which they have been aware of for some time but which Customs has refused to acknowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concept of Mining</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, we would like to make one very obvious point in relation to Senator Schacht's comments that the activities in question were not intended to be part of the scheme as originally envisaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The simple fact is that the intention of the scheme was to cover `mining operations', as that term is accepted in industry. As you are aware, on the basis of extensive evidence from expert witnesses and technical publications, the AAT and Federal Court have concluded on all four occasions that the extraction of industrial minerals for their mineral content does fall within the accepted concept of `mining'. For the Government to now exclude such operations from the scheme is discriminatory, particularly where these operations are no different from other mining operations which will remain eligible. To further differentiate the ineligible activities based on the particular mineral being mined as per the proposed amendments defies logic. </PARA>

In that decision both the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court confirmed that the dredging of sand for use as such, that is the value that it has for use as landfill, could not be regarded as a mining operation. For that reason no rebate, to our knowledge, has been paid in respect of any extraction of sand for use as sand.</PARA>

So during the period of Neumann No. 1 and Neumann No. 2, as it were, to our knowledge no claim was paid in respect of sand mining. That was why Neumann took us to task again. Rebate, of course, continued to be paid and will, in the future, continue to be paid for the mining of mineral sands from which specific minerals such as rutile are extracted.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Hurrell</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Senator, we should further clarify the point that I think Mr Ling was getting to.

The position is not so clear in respect of trucking operations. We will be having another look at that.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DIESEL FUEL REBATE&mdash;WINDFALL GAIN ASPECTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for meeting with representative of Boral, Pioneer and CSR on 29 May 1995. At that meeting we undertook to supply you and your advisers with further information and we will provide that later in this letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But first we would like to further address the issue of retrospectivity, which is a critical part of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe we have made clear our companies' absolute opposition to the use of such legislation. In support of our position, we would draw your attention to the view of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in its alert digest of 31 May 1995 on the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In commenting on the proposal to amend the law retrospectively, the Committee says, "This clearly trespasses on the basic right that those subject to the law are entitled to be treated according to what the law says at the relevant time and according to what the law means at that time as declared by the courts."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would also draw your attention to a 6 June 1995 statement by the Business Council of Australia which describes the retrospective proposal as "wrong in principle, discriminatory and exposes Australia to changes of heightened sovereign risk".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the issue of retrospectivity we have become concerned at statements by the responsible Minister, Senator Schacht, in support of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to defend the indefensible, Senator Schacht is joining a number of issues in order to confuse the situation&mdash;in particular by representing the Government's actions `closing off a proposal for people to get a windfall gain for activities they conducted nine years ago' (Senate p1147, 8 June 1995) and claiming it would cost $170 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pioneer, Boral and CSR wish to make their position absolutely clear:  This is not a matter of windfall gains engineered for them by so-called industry `consultants', as described by Senator Schacht, for claims lodged just before and after the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead, what is at risk for the companies are payments for claims, for which Notices of Intention to lodge, were made prior to 30 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, the companies have lodged and been paid for similar claims going back several years. If the Government believed these claims were outside the original intent of the Scheme, it should have acted in l989 when the first judicial decision went against the Australian Customs Service  (ACS).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the claims lodged prior to the Budget were subject to misleading undertakings given by the ACS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pioneer's position may give you an idea of how the Government proposes to deny companies their dues and how the ACS has behaved in the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pioneer lodged claims in May 1994 and was involved in extensive discussions with Customs. After first being advised that its claims would be accepted and paid, it was later notified that claims were to be deferred as a precedent case was pending (the first it knew of Neumann Sands case). Pioneer proceeded to lodge claims in relation to all of its sites prior to the end of June 1994 and agreed with Customs' suggestion that a decision on those claims be deferred until the AAT decided the Neumann case. When that case was decided in February, Customs advised Pioneer that an appeal to the Federal Court had been lodged and that its claims would be determined on the basis of that appeal. On 9 May 1995 the Minister announced the retrospective legislation and on 10 May Pioneer received notice that its claims were to be denied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before proceeding to consider other matters, it is important to understand from the outset that the matters raised here relate to the treatment of industrial minerals. The appropriate treatment of other issues (such as parks and gardens, water supply, etc), and the background to such matters, is a totally separate matter. The Government appears to be keen to `muddy the waters' on these distinct issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Original Intention</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 29 May discussions you asked for our view on the original intention of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A copy of the 1982 Explanatory Memorandum and Second Reading Speech can be found at Attachment A. Other material makes reference to alterations in the treatment of specific industry sectors (eg railways) but this does not impact on the treatment of industrial minerals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has stated that the proposed changes outlined in the Budget context (including those relating to industrial minerals) reflect the original intent of the legislation. But this is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to 1982, a certificate scheme operated to provide up-front exemption for diesel fuel purchased for off-road use. Under that Scheme a purchaser could quote a certificate time of purchase of the diesel fuel and obtain exemption by way of an excise-free price.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As indicated in the attached 1982 documentation, this Scheme was very much subject to abuse as it fundamentally relied on honesty in providing certificates in the appropriate circumstances. With effect from 1982, the Government introduced a scheme aimed at preventing this abuse through identifying those industries/uses which it could be expected that vehicles would be used off-road. In the Second Reading Speech of Mr Hodgman (the then Minister for Capital Territory and Minister assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce), in the context of talking about the new Scheme, said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The categories I have just referred to relate to the use of diesel fuel in the agriculture, mining, forestry and fishing industries, in domestic premises, hospitals, aged persons homes and nursing homes. The overriding qualification for rebate will be that the fuel so used will be used otherwise than for the purposes of propelling a road vehicle on a public road."</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(emphasis added)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be seen from this passage and indeed the general comments made in the attached documentation that the overriding purpose of the changes in 1982 was not to change the fundamental scope of the Scheme but rather to prevent the abuse in question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The companies were in fact entitled to exemption under that original Scheme. Further, in the operations involving the extraction of industrial minerals, the use of diesel fuel is virtually always in respect of equipment used or propelled otherwise than on a public road. This much is supported by the decisions of the courts in relation to certain clay, limestone, black granite and sand (from 1988 onwards) and is clearly contrary to the comments made by the Government in the Budget documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concept of Mining</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be seen from the attached definitions that the concept of `minerals' is generally sufficiently broad to encompass activities associated with the extraction of clay, limestone, sand, granite, basalt and dolomite when recovered to harness their inherent mineral properties. Indeed, in many instances, these substances are specifically mentioned as falling within the definition. A ready example can be found in the Commonwealth legislation (the first definition found at Attachment B).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The facts that the extraction of industrial minerals can be categorised as `mining' is evident from the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">in many cases, the activities in question operate in direct competition with traditional open-cut mines. It is clearly inequitable that the traditional mines would receive the DFR benefit while the operations in question would not;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the development of technology, geological science and the use of minerals has meant that it has become virtually impossible to distinguish between mining and quarrying operations;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the activities in question operate under the mining leases in most States;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the activities in question are treated as mining for other revenue purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the day, what the companies in question are doing is, as a matter of fact, mining for minerals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Facts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been a number of confusing comments made in relation to the proposed amendments. The facts in relation to the treatment of industrial minerals need to be clarified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fact 1&mdash;The original intention of the Scheme as evidenced in the attached 1982 material was to provide rebate for fuel used in off-road applications. This was achieved through the identification of certain industries and uses (including `mining') being those uses where equipment is ordinarily used off-road.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fact 2&mdash;The only exclusion in the relevant legislation which relates to quarrying activities is to `quarrying operations carried on for the sole purpose of obtaining stone for building, road making or similar purposes'. The cases have confirmed that it is clear from this exclusion that other quarrying operations (ie those which are the subject of the amendments in question)  are intended to be covered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fact 3&mdash;DFR has traditionally been claimed retrospectively, following the consumption of the diesel fuel. It is not uncommon for companies to delay claims for a number of years. This traditional approach has largely stemmed from the fact that, up until 1994, retrospective claims could be made as far back as August 1986 and indexation of rates means that claimants are not penalised through delaying lodgement of claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fact 4&mdash;In addition to the above, the DFR legislation has not been clearly understood and this has led to at least eight cases over a period of seven years, as well as changing ACS treatment and policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fact 5&mdash;Claims in respect of sand extraction have been lodged and paid since the early 1980s. Consequent upon the decision in Neumann Sands, and despite the fact that that decision found in favour of the applicant, the ACS has ceased paying such claims. Sand is one of the minerals which will be excluded if the Bill is passed through Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fact 6&mdash;Claims in respect of clay extraction have been lodged prior to 1989, and certainly lodged since that date, pursuant to the decision in the Boral Bricks Case. That company is of course one of the companies within the Boral Group. Clay is one of the minerals which will be excluded if the Bill is passed through Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fact 7&mdash;Claims in respect of limestone extraction have been lodged and paid well before 1989 when the matter of beneficiation was examined in the Adelaide Brighton Case. Limestone is one of the minerals which will be excluded if the bill is passed through Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fact 8&mdash;Claims in respect of black granite have been made and claimed since 1988, pursuant to the decision in the Bell Basic Case. Black granite is one of the minerals which will be excluded if the Bill is passed through Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fact 9&mdash;Claims in respect of aggregate extraction have been lodged and paid in respect of diesel used since August 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fact 10&mdash;A number of claims for other minerals have been lodged over the last 12 months, many in May and June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fact 11&mdash;With effect from 1 July 1994, the Government amended the legislation so that retrospective claims could only be made going back three years. All the companies in question lodged Notices of Intention prior to 30 June 1994 to protect their entitlements going back to August 1986. The companies are aware of a number of other companies who similarly lodged Notices of Intention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fact 12&mdash;Over the last 12 months, the ACS has refused to pay some claims on the basis that the decision in Neumann Sands would further clarify the scope of the relevant legislation, not only in respect of sand mining but also other operations. Following the ACS decision to appeal Neumann Sands, the ACS has again refused to process the claims in question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fact 13&mdash;Legislative definitions of `minerals' at Attachment B encompass the industrial minerals in question and there is now no distinction between traditional open-cut mining and the operations in question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be seen from the above facts that this is not by any account a situation where claims have been lodged since February 1995 with the expectation of obtaining a large benefit, which the companies only became aware of following both the Neumann Sands decision and the media rumours relating to possible changes to the DFR Scheme. To summarise the above facts:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the operations in question do fall within the original intention of the Scheme;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the companies in question, as well as other companies, have been making claims in respect of sand, clay, limestone and aggregate during the 1980s and since then; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the companies in question, as well as other companies, did lodge claims or Notices of Intention prior to 30 June 1994 on the basis of a clear understanding that there were remaining operations which were eligible and which had not been claimed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the exact scope of the Scheme has never been clear (as is evidenced by the number of court decisions), it is clear from the above facts that the companies have been aware of an entitlement which could be pursued at a convenient time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the extent that there was a rush of claims prior to the Budget, this was indeed due to rumours associated with potential changes in the Budget but consequent upon the Notices of Intention lodged in June 1994. The Budget rumours merely brought forward action which the companies had clearly intended taking for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation of the DFR Scheme can be contrasted with provisions of the various Bounty Acts (also administered by the Customs authorities). In the later instance there is a clearly defined period in which claims must be lodged. This has not been the case with the DFR Scheme up until the 1994 amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any delay in lodging claims also needs to be considered in the context of the ACS's changing policy. The ACS has generally been reluctant to acknowledge that the DFR Scheme includes certain industrial minerals. This is despite the original intention and also despite the on-going case law. After each case, the ACS has changed its policy but only to allow rebate on the actual minerals which were the subject of that case. Companies are generally reluctant to offend a Government body by taking legal action&mdash;but obviously have been forced to do so in the cases to date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, as indicated above, some of the claims lodged prior to the Budget were subject to misleading undertakings given by the ACS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parks and Gardens and Water Supply</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we have said, it is important to distinguish between operations associated with the extraction of industrial minerals and other proposed amendments dealing with parks and gardens, water supply and other matters. It is unusual that the Government has sought to amend the legislation for parks and gardens in light of the fact that the only relevant decision (being City of Nunawading and Comptroller General of Customs) found in favour of the ACS. Nonetheless, the Government's policy on the above matters is a totally separate issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to Government Claims</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Financial Review of 8 June 1995, Senator Schacht is reported as making certain claims in relation to the operation of the DFR Scheme. Relevant extracts from that article are quoted below with the following comments indicating the correct position:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`. . . most (claims) have been lodged only since February as accountancy firms and consultancies have realised the extent of loopholes allowing a broad range of activities to be classified as `connected with' agriculture and mining, thus qualifying for the rebate.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important in this context to distinguish the various categories of claims and to remember that the issues for this purpose relate only to the extraction of industrial minerals. In that context, the following reply is warranted:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">as indicated, a vary large number of claims have been lodged over an extensive period in respect of sand, clay, limestone and granite. As a result of Budget speculation, it is true that many (but certainly not most) claims were lodged prior to Budget night in an attempt to ensure hat the companies in question maintained their legal rights;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">in the context of industrial minerals, it will be seen from the list of court cases which have been handed down since l988 that this is not a matter of accountancy firms and consultancies realising the `extent of loopholes'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of industrial minerals, the courts have consistently held, since 1988, that they should be part of the DFR Scheme.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would like to add to the invitation to Minister Schacht to have the stomach to stand up and apologise to those he has so offended&mdash;it seems not only on this side of the chamber but perhaps on his own side as well. I am giving Senator Schacht the benefit of the doubt and presuming that he knows the resolutions of the Senate and he therefore knew of the obligation on senators when he put out that press release last night. That is that, after the calling of the division and before the vote, their obligation was to acknowledge their particular shareholding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the beginning and the end of their responsibility under the terms of the orders that have been passed by this chamber. Did Senator Schacht mention that in his press release? No, he gave a press release to the gallery saying that those who held shares in these public companies basically had to abstain from the vote. In other words, he not only misled the press but was seeking last night to mislead senators as to their obligations in an effort to almost fraudulently win the vote on this issue. The offence it has caused to individual honourable senators was of no consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand, furthermore, that not only did he put out that press release, but he also separately put out a list of the names of senators who, he believed, had interests or shares. I would like to see him deny that as well. So there were the two press releases, the public one and the secret one. No doubt, he spent all day poring over the interest declarations of senators. That is a point worth remembering, too: these interests were already on a public register. Did he mention that in a press release? We accept that, in addition to the obligation to be on the public register, there is also the obligation to acknowledge a shareholding before the vote is taken. That is why several people did so last night and today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a pretty squalid little exercise of trying to win a few points in the press gallery at the expense of the good names of honourable senators who are meeting their obligation to the Senate in the terms the Senate has imposed upon them. I can see no reason for his not standing up now, showing a bit of intestinal fortitude and making a public apology to the senators concerned. If he declines to do so, we will consider what other action ought to be taken this afternoon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was about the construction of the Brockman Spur line. The rebate was paid. Customs officers advised me that this was paid in error and should not have been paid. They accept that an error was made. I have to point out that when one is dealing with over 200,000 applications for rebates per year, from time to time there will be an error. We are not in the business of reclaiming the rebate. It has been paid, but it certainly was not within the policy guidelines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator, I wanted to put that on the record to clarify the remarks I made. Someone may be able to produce this particular case but it was made in error&mdash;and we apologise for that. There are 140 people in Customs dealing with over 200,000 applications a year. There is always going to be the odd chance for an error here or there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a brief comment about the remarks just made by some senators. We are waiting for the drafting of the amendment to complete this debate. As soon as it is available&mdash;and it is being drafted now in agreement with Senator Margetts and government advisers&mdash;the matter will be put and that will be the end of the debate. A number of senators made remarks about my press statement last night and the general remarks I made about the retrospectivity clause as it affects three companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is reasonable to draw it to the attention of senators that when they vote in this place on those retrospectivity clauses, where over $70 million will be going to three companies which have publicly and openly lobbied for the rebates, there is no doubt that that is beyond what we normally vote for here, such as social security benefits or whatever. Voting on a Medicare bill, for example, is different&mdash;we all get access to Medicare in one form or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a special case where three companies&mdash;if this legislation is defeated and the court upholds their appeal&mdash;will get between $70 million and $90 million in windfall gain. They have already charged their customers for the product, based on the full cost of diesel. They have given no indication that they will repay the money to the customers or reduce their prices. I presume it will go to the shareholders or be retained and advance the value of the company. Therefore, anybody who does own shares in that company will, in my view, stand to gain. I thought it was only reasonable to raise this issue before the vote. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distribution last night of the press statement in the gallery was the lowest form of sleaze that I have seen since I have been here.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That press statement was not sent to senators. I did not receive one. I got one from a journalist who sent it down to me. It was not intended to come to me. I do not believe that it was intended to come to anyone in this place. It was a stunt by Senator Schacht to score a cheap shot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week at the hearings representatives of either Pioneer Boral or CSR&mdash;it will be on the record&mdash;did answer the question of how the money would be distributed if any of the rebate was paid back.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is no good for Senator Schacht to stand over there and say that the companies have not commented on it. I draw Senator Schacht's attention to page three of the letter that I tabled today, or had incorporated, with regard to those companies addressing that particular aspect of it. I also draw his attention to their submission to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to highlight the point that the answer to the question is simple: they said that, to the extent that Customs had agreed that the rebate was payable, that is, clay, limestone and black granite, the companies did include the rebate in their budget and pricing calculations. Having won their cases in the Federal Court and having budgeted for it, they have now not been paid.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent her moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion to defer further consideration of the Government Business order of the day relating to the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1995 until the Minister representing the Attorney-General (Senator Bolkus) purges his comtempt of the Senate by tabling all remaining documents required by the order for the production of documents agreed to by the Senate on 28 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>I am moving this suspension as a matter of urgency. Senator Bolkus, the Minister representing the Attorney-General has now been in contempt of the Senate for over 24 hours because he has failed to fully comply with the terms of the return to order passed by the Senate yesterday afternoon. As I said yesterday, for the second time in a month the government has used a very narrow definition of what it is required to table under a return to order to exclude any document which may be damaging to its cause. The Senate has always taken a grave view of the contempt shown to it by ministers who fail to comply with returns to order. In recent times many of the non-government senators who have succeeded in getting returns to order agreed to by the Senate have been lenient on the minister in this regard, and there is a limit, particularly when the contempt is as profound as it is today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us make some things clear. The Marks royal commission is not a Commonwealth commission or a Commonwealth inquiry. The three examples that the government used to justify its funding the case in the statement tabled by the minister yesterday are all cases involving Commonwealth commissions of inquiry about matters relating to Commonwealth issues. This is a WA state matter and involves matters which relate to the actions or knowledge of Dr Carmen Lawrence in her role as the Premier of Western Australia. It does not involve matters that in any way relate to her current role as the federal Minister for Human Services and Health. As I said yesterday, if it did she would be covered by the guidelines for the provision of assistance to Commonwealth government ministers and parliamentary secretaries in relation to the defence of legal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, the government has provided no substantial argument for why the case should be funded because it involves important points of constitutional law or federal state relations. I suspect the reason for not providing the arguments is that there are none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the government is unwilling to provide the documents which provide the advice from the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Finance on whether Dr Lawrence's case fits in with the current guidelines because the case clearly does not. The onus is now very much on the government and the minister to answer why it has agreed to provide funding for this action. The onus is on the government to answer why it is providing funding for a federal minister in circumstances where, to the best of my knowledge, no other individual has ever been provided with assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said already that the Minister representing the Attorney-General has now been in contempt of the Senate for over 24 hours. For this reason, I believe that proceeding with or calling on the bill of the Attorney-General, which we were about to do, while he remains in contempt of the Senate is inappropriate. That is why it is urgent that we consider whether we once again may be allowing the integrity and authority of the Senate to be undermined. I urge my colleagues to support the suspension to debate this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think two matters ought to be dealt with before we would be prepared to support a suspension of standing orders. There is a lot of merit in what Senator Chamarette says. The behaviour of Senator Bolkus is absolutely appalling. He is in contempt of the Senate, and that is a very serious matter. He laughs it off, but if we allow him to laugh it off without taking any action then he will do it again. However, there is a message from the House of Representatives regarding the taxation bill. As members of the House are waiting to deal with that bill, and as I understand it is a very brief debate, it ought to be dealt with before we debate Senator Bolkus's behaviour. Secondly, there is the longstanding matter of Senator Patterson's private member's bill, which I gather is a one-minute job. We will not support the suspension at the moment. If we can deal with these two matters quickly, then we would be of a mind to support Senator Chamarette's motion if she wished to re-move it at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>

There are not only the matters that Senator Hill referred to but also a range of very significant bills to which commitments have been given to deal with before the Senate gets up. I can assure you that the government will not be resiling from the necessity to deal with the noise measures that are contained in the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995 and the Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Bill 1995. There are very significant social security benefits in a package before the Senate. The significance of the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill and what Senator Hill said in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 is true. We do have a responsibility to deal with these matters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The requests to which the House of Representatives has not agreed relate to the provisional tax uplift factor and another item, but I think that the provisional tax uplift factor is the main one. The request made by the coalition and the Australian Democrats was to reduce the uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. We understand now that the government does not propose to accept that amendment. The coalition will not press the request at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the sake of taxpayers, certainty, I think, is very important. With the commitment of the coalition to review this matter in government, particularly taking into account the excellent report that was presented to the Senate this week dealing with a whole range of matters affecting small business, and as part of that report, there was an extended consideration of the whole question of the uplift factor. We will look at that report very carefully, and we will be reviewing in government the whole of this area of taxation. Withdrawing our insistence on the request will take it back to an uplift factor of eight per cent in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the government's legislation, the ongoing uplift factor is a massive 10 per cent. Be it on the government's head if it wishes to persist with a piece of legislation that is so patently damaging to small business. We certainly wish&mdash;and we give an undertaking&mdash;to totally review the whole of this area of taxation in government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the measures that are still to be debated are the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995 and the Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Bill. The purpose of those bills, which the opposition and other senators in the chamber apparently want to block, is to impose a levy on jet aircraft landings at airports where the federal government has introduced a noise amelioration program to reduce the impact of noise on residents who live close to airports. That is the sort of thing you want to stop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has introduced an amelioration program at Sydney airport at a cost in excess of $100 million in this financial year and, I believe, well in excess of $250 million in the longer term. These bills are important. Of course a delay in these bills will result in increases in costs to the aviation industry owing to the uncertainty in an ability to pass on the costs of tickets pre-sold for travel after the implementation of the tax. It is a disgrace to derail this sort of legislation in favour of some mealy-mouthed attempt to criticise a government minister for fulfilling his responsibilities in a very proper way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social security package will also go down the spout if the Senate decides to deal with the political diatribe that is proposed by Senator Chamarette, and not its legislative program. We should look at what that legislative package will mean. It is critical that it be passed because it contains income test changes for the under 18 sickness allowance and YTA customers. These were announced by the government as part of its white paper on employment. There is a range of very important initiatives in those bills and the other bills that are before this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think most of your people have gone home already, minister. The real problem goes back to the government's structuring of the whole year's program and the mismanagement of the first sitting weeks of the year when Senator Faulkner abdicated his responsibility as Manager of Government Business because of other matters. You are aware, Madam Deputy President, that the government structured the year whereby it would have two parliamentary sittings to basically deal with non-budget matters and one brief parliamentary sitting in the centre of the year to deal with the budget. It set aside five weeks to deal with the budget and budget related matters. If Senator Faulkner had concentrated on that task alone, he would have achieved what he wished to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding that, the government has still basically achieved almost everything that it wanted. Its appropriation bills are through and its principal taxation measures have been voted upon. Fortunately, I am pleased to say that its efforts to impose a new tax on building products was defeated. We made all efforts possible to try to reduce the uplift factor on provisional tax but, unfortunately, the numbers were against us in the end. We have done our best on the issue of retrospective tax on diesel fuel as well. The matters of great substance in the government's program have been debated and voted upon in these sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that Senator Faulkner has not been able to get a bit further into this program; he might talk to Senator Schacht about that afterwards. The distraction resulted from Senator Schacht's abusive press release of yesterday. Senator Faulkner might focus upon the contemptuous Minister Bolkus and the fact that it is his contempt and nothing else that is causing delay in the Senate program at the moment. He could walk in and put down those documents now and the matter would be concluded, but he will not because he has certain political objectives in the matter of Dr Lawrence. He does not care two hoots about the program when it comes to a choice of putting down those documents which may embarrass Dr Lawrence. What is that issue all about? It is about whether the taxpayer should be funding her case before the Western Australian royal commission. If there is one subject that the Senate ought to be debating, it is that subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the rest of the bills that are on the program, we see that we will actually support most of them when the government brings them on. Presumably, it will bring them on in just seven weeks when the Senate returns. I gather that we will support the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill, dealing with the levy to be imposed on airlines. We will also support most of the social security legislation. It was totally misleading to say that we were opposed to it. We have amendments, the Democrats have amendments and, believe it or not, the government has amendments to its own bill again. But the bottom line is that we are going to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill is an administrative tidying up bill, which we will support as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise briefly some further matters relating to Mr Keating's former half-ownership of a piggery group. I want to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that today I received information that two more of the companies in that group have failed to abide by the requirements of the Australian Securities Commission. These were related to the Olympia Group of this piggery operation, which was hived off and had as a director for a while Mr Eddie Obeid, a well-known member of the right wing of the Labor Party in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The companies involved are Intercool Constructions Pty Ltd and Intercool Food Technology Australia Pty Ltd, where strike-off action is in progress in both companies because of the failure to abide by the requirements of the Australian Securities Commission. Naturally, when you look at who the directors of these companies are, you find that Mr Achilles Constantinidis is a director of one of them&mdash;Mr Constantinidis, of course, was Mr Keating's piggery partner&mdash;and a director of the other one is Mr Christopher Steven Coudounaris, who is the secretary of Mr Keating's family company, and among various other matters has been closely involved in the quaint piggery activity of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this is just another in the extraordinarily long list of breaches of the Corporations Law by companies in that group, companies in which Mr Constantinidis plays a significant role. I would like to deal at some length at another time with the activities of Intercool Constructions and Mr Constantinidis in what I believe to be a most disgraceful set of actions involving the construction of a building in South Hurstville. I have spoken to many of the participants in this, where a device was used to get respected Sydney builders to prepare and present design and construction briefs which were then&mdash;to use the polite expression&mdash;knocked off by a company run by Mr Constantinidis, that is, Intercool Constructions, which was registered for the purpose, so that all the hard work of those five leading Sydney builders was in vain but provided the basis on which Mr Constantinidis could, in fact, be his own constructing authority. That was on the basis, of course, of advice, information and plans which were, no doubt, helpful to this company that he was running in proceeding with that building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might mention that it is typical that these two companies, registered in 1992, have never provided an annual return to the Australian Securities Commission. Yet they were operating; they were dealing with the public; they were involving themselves in debts. This is a classic example of the style, the nature and the deceptive, disgraceful behaviour of companies in what I consistently describe as the Keating piggery group&mdash;the group that he was a half-owner of. And, in this case, he was a half-owner of a company which, once again, half-owned Intercool Constructions Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only were there those breaches of the companies law, but we are now in a situation where before the Industrial Relations Court at the moment there is a matter in which ex-employees of a Keating piggery company are pursuing that company for wrongful dismissal when they proved that they had been underpaid. While Mr Keating was a half-owner of this group, they were not even being paid the award rates. When they complained to the industrial relations department and got back pay, what happened to them? They were sacked. That matter is before the Industrial Relations Court today. The point I want to stress is that they were employees being underpaid for years while Paul Keating was the half-owner. It is a great role, isn't it, for a Labor Prime Minister? It is typical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only were there continual breaches of the industrial relations law and the Corporations Law, but there were also breaches of environmental laws. They were continually breaching the pollution laws in New South Wales and using dishonest devices to avoid prosecution by, in fact, transferring the activities of one company to another without registering the transfer. So when the New South Wales pollution control people pursued the company that was shown to be the owner, it was found not to be that company, and the time for the prosecution had by then expired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been breaches of the workers compensation situation, because for years there was a failure to pay workers compensation and insurance premiums. They were taken to court. They settled on the doors of the court. They did not pay workers comp properly. They failed to pay for many months the superannuation deductions collected from employees into the notified superannuation fund. That is an absolute disgrace. This is not just Mr and Mrs Crooked Director; this is the Labor Prime Minister of Australia, who half-owned these companies. It is just incredible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another thing, of course. They falsely claimed that the employing company at one of the piggeries was a separate limited liability company. In fact, when I am examined it and when I went and searched it, no such company existed. That is an offence under the Companies Act. I might say that they have not been prosecuted yet&mdash;much to my astonishment. This offence was admitted to me by the Australian Securities Commission. In Senate estimates, it said, `Yes, it is an offence.' The purpose of doing this was to deceive its employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This group has, until last week, been the subject of wind-up proceedings for misallocating millions of dollars following an incredible sale of half the group's equity&mdash;that is, Mr Keating's half equity&mdash;to an Indonesian company. The matter was resolved by agreement. I understand very heavy pressure was brought on Mr Constantinidis, in particular, of the Australian group to resolve this matter because, of course, the longer it went on the more it was evident that this transfer deal involving Mr Keating had a smell about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I put two simple questions about this deal to Mr Keating. When you reported to parliament in your misleading letter of 31 March last year that you had disposed of your half-ownership of the Euphron piggery group, why did you fail to reveal that part of the deal arranged with the real purchasers, the Indonesians, three days before you disposed of your shares, was the issue of an option to purchase from the Indonesians and Mr Constantinidis a total of one-third of the piggery group's equity at cost within the next 10 years&mdash;an incredibly generous offer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this option is to be to be exercised by an unnamed person to be nominated either by your piggery partner, Mr Constantinidis, or by Mr Coudounaris, who is the secretary of your family company, will you give an unequivocal assurance that there is no agreement or understanding of any kind under which you or your family will directly or indirectly be offered the right to purchase this one-third interest in your formerly half-owned company, recognising that an agreement or understanding to have the right to exercise a purchase option represents a material interest in a company which you have not declared to this parliament?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Prime Minister not to duck this question in the way he ducks every question from the parliament and from the gallery, as he did this week, about these matters. I think it is about time the Prime Minister came clean on just how dirty his piggery hands really are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night I was talking about Australian Defence Industries and was preparing to reveal how Australian Defence Industries has been selling arms to Papua New Guinea to prop up the war in Bougainville. I recalled that, if we sell Australian Defence Industries, the government loses accountability for Australian Defence Industries' role in the arms trade. The ethical amongst us would probably like to see a government concerned with human rights abuses in its region getting right out of the business that deals in death and destruction to its region's minority groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government might like to rid itself of Australian Defence Industries to excuse itself of its hypocrisies. However, if ADI is sold off&mdash;obviously the most lucrative sections of the company would be sold first&mdash;the government and the Australian people will have less idea about what goes on at ADI and ADI's role in the regional arms trade than ever before. ADI will be able to shield even more behind commercial in confidence and hide its sales and export figures. Parliament will have less ability to scrutinise what has been manufactured and what we are exporting to our neighbours, with inadequate export guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few months, a Victorian human rights organisation called Australian Humanitarian Aid for Bougainville has been researching the links between Australian Defence Industries and the war in Bougainville. It was claimed at the national women's peace camp in April, at the ADI munitions factory in Benalla, that ADI weaponry is used in the war in Bougainville. This is a long running seven-year war in which over 5,000 people have been killed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been active in supporting the war in Bougainville, due to our special defence relationship with Papua New Guinea and to protect our economic interests in the form of the Australian company CRA, a subsidiary of multinational Rio Tinto Zinc, RTZ, which owns the Bougainville copper mine where the war began. The Australian Defence Force has trained over 3,000 members of the Papua New Guinea defence force since 1975. This figure is equivalent to 90 per cent of the total officer corps trained in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the claims of the women at the peace camp, an ADI spokesperson who came out to speak to the media and refute the women's claims said ADI did not export ammunition to the Papua New Guinea defence forces. This ADI spokesperson has misled the Australian public. The work of Australian Humanitarian Aid for Bougainville has proved this by uncovering the truth about ADI's relationship with the Papua New Guinea defence force and the war in Bougainville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AHAB has found that ADI's relationship with the Papua New Guinea defence force has been a `long one'. ADI's last two regional managers for Pacific international business both had regular contact with the PNGDF and made trips to Papua New Guinea to promote ADI weaponry. Papua New Guinea has close defence links with Australia, receiving millions of dollars in military aid every year. Since 1975, Australia has provided Papua New Guinea with $444 million in defence cooperation funds alone, which is a quarter of that program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">PNGDF gets arms from Australia in three ways: firstly, by the ADF from the defence cooperation program; secondly, via the ADF under supply support agreement; and, thirdly, straight from ADI. In the past, the defence cooperation agreement was how the PNGDF received Iroquois helicopters and Pacific class patrol boats from Australia. Most of Papua New Guinea's other defence equipment needs are supplied under supply support agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The link between ADI, the Papua New Guinea defence force and ammunition is that ADI makes all the ammunition used by the ADF. Any ammunition that ADF sells to Papua New Guinea is made by ADI. Last year, the Papua New Guinea defence force bought ammunition directly from ADI. However, standard practice when PNG requests ammunition is for ADI to sell the ammunition to the ADF, which then on-sells it to the Papua New Guinea defence force. This process ensures ADI's name can be clear of the deal with the Papua New Guinea defence force and still earn the profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another deal that ADI is into is selling Papua New Guinea rifles. ADI makes the Steyr rifles at its factory in Lithgow, New South Wales. Due to this contract ending this year, ADI is looking for new markets to sell the rifle, including to the Thai and Indonesian defence forces, both of which are known for their frequent human rights violations. The Papua New Guinea defence force is now in the process of upgrading its small arms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The association that I was talking about, AHAB, has found that ADI has sent a number of Steyr rifles to Papua New Guinea for the Papua New Guinea Defence Forces to trial. ADI representatives have also been in Papua New Guinea promoting the Steyr rifle. The Australian Defence Force is encouraging the Papua New Guinea Defence Force to buy its new rifles from ADI. Clearly, the relationship between ADI and the Papua New Guinea Defence Force is a lot closer than ADI is prepared to admit to the Australian people!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What else does ADI sell to Papua New Guinea? It sells ADI grenades which the government claims are not technically landmines. ADI has already sent samples of its range of hand grenades to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force which already has the new F1 model. There is evidence to suggest that these grenades have been used by the Papua New Guinea Defence Force on Bougainville. The grenades can be detonated by pressure activation, pressure release, by trip wire and also by remote delivery such as from an ADI Steyr rifle. These alternative ways of detonation actually class these so-called grenades as technically landmines under protocol II of the United Nations Convention of Prohibitions or Restrictions on the use of certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects. No wonder our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) was coy about Australia actually banning such things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that ADI is a government owned enterprise and we see these incredible hypocrisies with ADI manufacturing weapons against its own policies of working internationally to ban landmines and to stop their proliferation in wars in our region. The government knows that millions of landmines keep the war going for civilians long after a conflict has ended. This is especially the case for people living in agrarian societies who must return to the land to retain their way of life and their livelihoods. PNG and Bougainville is one such example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So how does ADI transfer its arms to PNG? When they travel by sea, they travel with shipping companies Pacific Forum Line and Chief Container Services. When the arms and munitions travel by air, they go by the C130 Hercules aircraft on training flights to PNG, or on Qantas or Air New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government must face up to its lack of dignity and ethics by stopping ADI's role in arming PNG against Bougainville. The government cannot wriggle out of its responsibilities to stop being an arms supplier in the region by selling off the arms manufacturer. The government must instead meet this problem head-on and stop the export of arms and ammunition from ADI. There is no purpose to this export of arms and ammunition except to make Australia money and we can do this without dirty money. If ADI is privatised, and it will be because it is only a matter of time, this unethical behaviour will have no checks and balances on the part of the government and the Australian people apart from the normal commercial export defence practices which, as we know, are very flawed, and exports to our region will continue to grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will see more Steyr rifle deals to Thailand, to the Khmer Rouge, to Indonesia to suppress dissent in East Timor, Aceh and West Papua. We will basically see the extension and acceleration of the government's existing unethical policy of arms sales to the region within the very poor framework of ineffective arms control through the customs and defence export guidelines regimes. This organisation, AHAB, has clearly stated how Australia is arming the war on Bougainville. It is now up to the government to do something to stop it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my community of Townsville in the electorate of Mundingburra, the sitting Labor Party member, Mr Kenneth Henry Davies, is the parliamentary chairman of the CJC.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The firm of which he was a member got into some financial difficulties. The bank foreclosed on the firm. On 12 May 1995 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> ran an article under the heading `PCJC Chief Sued by Bank', under the name of John Camplin, the Townsville correspondent for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>. The story, which was quite open, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> on 12 May 1955 was about the possibility of Mr Davies becoming bankrupt if the bank proved its case. The case has not gone to court. Mr Davies is defending it. He has a difficulty, because if judgment is made against him and he is made bankrupt he may not be able to sit in parliament. That is all history. That is all on the public record. I am not disclosing anything new. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently the Liberal candidate for the seat of Mundingburra was doing a bit of door knocking. A constituent raised the issue, or something happened. According to a writ served, the Liberal candidate, Mr Francis John Tanti, said something about this quite public report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>. The person he was talking to turned out to be a Labor Party member or something. I do not know the details. They are not relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Mr Tanti had served on him a writ from the Supreme Court of Queensland claiming damages for defamation. There was a letter from Mr Davies's solicitors threatening the Liberal candidate that further action would be taken if he said any more, or whatever solicitors say in these letters. I do not know what the letter said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It disturbs me that the minute an election comes around the Labor Party is up to its old tricks&mdash;issuing stopper writs to stop legitimate debate in a campaign. I was never a defamation lawyer, and I know nothing about it. Even if the complaint is proved and judgment given for defamation, by explaining it to one person in a house in a street, the amount of damages to be awarded would be absolutely infinitesimal. Why would anyone issue such a writ? It disturbs me that that sort of thing happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would hope that, in a democracy, at election time all issues are on the table. It disturbs me that the Labor Party is again up to its old tricks of trying to interfere with freedom of speech and legitimate debate in the community. It is of regret that the Labor Party continues to proceed on that basis. I thought that in this adjournment debate it should again be put on record that the Labor Party is again up to its old tricks. </PARA>
