<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 29 June 1995 concerning Determination HS/1/1995 made under section 3C of the Health Insurance Act 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is specified in the determination that section 4 of the National Health Act 1953 shall not apply to the item in the schedule to the determination in circumstances where the service specified in the item was rendered at any time between 1 November 1994 and the date of the determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this clause is that health funds are exempted from paying "gap" benefits for services rendered from 1 November 1994 to 26 May 1995.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 10 August 1995 on aspects raised by the Committee of Determination HS/1/1995 made under s.3C of the Health Insurance Act 1973. The Committee considered the letter at its meeting of 24 August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted your advice that the retrospective instrument does not impose financial liability on any person other than the Commonwealth. The Committee would appreciate your advice, however, of the effect of the Determination on those people who are members of the health funds. Is the effect that people who would otherwise have been entitled to "gap" benefits were deprived of them retrospectively by the Determination?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 28 August 1995 and the notice of motion in Parliament on 31 August 1995 to disallow Determination HS/1/1995 made by me under section 3C of the Health Insurance Act 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, the health funds are not required to pay "gap" benefits for the service covered by the determination for the period of retrospectivity, i.e. from 1 November 1994 to 26 May 1995. The clause in the determination specifying that section 4 of the National Health Act does not apply for this period is necessary as the Acts Interpretation Act precludes retrospectivity in legislation if it imposes a financial liability on any person or organisation other than the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, patients are still entitled to receive a benefit of 75% of the Medicare Benefits Schedule fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I felt that this was a reasonable compromise, which allowed patients some benefit but did not disadvantage the health funds through a retrospective arrangement. Without this determination patients would have received no benefit at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The determination corrected an anomaly whereby no Medicare benefit was payable for the specified service. The Health Insurance Commission had been holding claims pending the determination which was made retrospective to allow payment of these claims. Under the determination, patients are entitled to a Medicare rebate of 75% of the specified fee from 1 November 1994 to 26 May 1995, with a 100% entitlement from 26 May (i.e. 75% Medicare benefit plus 25% fund "gap" benefit) for insured patients. An item to cover the service is included in proposed amendments to the health insurance regulations to be introduced from 1 November 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of disallowing the determination will be to deny patients any benefit for the service until 1 November 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I request that you withdraw your notice of motion to have this determination disallowed.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 28 August 1995 seeking advice as to the reason why most of the fees relating to the assessment of agricultural and veterinary chemicals by the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (NRA) were doubled by means of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Regulations (Amendment).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NRA recovers its costs by a three-tiered fee scheme, namely a levy on sales of agricultural and veterinary chemicals, annual reregistration fees on agvet chemicals, and application fees for the various tasks undertaken by the NRA. Additionally, in 1995/96, the Commonwealth is contributing $ 50 000 to fund the Minor Use Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995/96 the NRA will receive $12.8 million, the levy providing approximately 50% of that amount and the reregistration fees and application fees each providing approximately 25% each. The application fees were, of course, the subject of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1995 No 137.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full cost-recovery for the NRA has been introduced in a phased manner. In 1994/95 the rate of cost-recovery was 83.3%, and in 1995/96 it will be almost 100%, with, as noted above, only $50 000 being contributed by the Commonwealth. The NRA has therefore needed to raise extra funds commencing, on 1 July 1995 to cover this higher level of cost-recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to this recent amendment to the regulations application fees only covered a small portion of the actual cost of assessing applications. Accordingly, it was felt that, while some supplementation of application assessment costs by way of reregistration fees and the levy was appropriate, the then-prevailing level of cross-subsidy, or supplementation, was too great. The recent doubling of application fees brings application fees closer to the real cost of assessing applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the early part of 1995 the NRA completed a review of its fee structure, and provided me with the results. The NRA received 53 submissions from industry in drawing up its report, and advised that adoption of the recommendations was widely supported by industry. The NRA also advised that the proposed fee changes reflected proposals from the two main industry organisations, Avcare and the Veterinary Manufacturers and Distributors Association.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the lunchbreak there should be bills which are non-controversial.

The government has not explained to us why we are now hit with two bills, whereas on the previous occasion, on that date, we were presented with one piece of legislation; namely, the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was on my motion that that legislation was divided. It was divided so as to incorporate into a separate bill the amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act. The committee divided the bill. That was endorsed by the Senate.

If the House of Representatives ignores an action of the Senate and the executive government introduces two other separate pieces of legislation, then the system has broken down. I do admit that by the very fact that the government has introduced these two separate pieces of legislation, that is two separate bills, it has taken up some of the points I made in the speech on 9 June. One of those points was that one of the measures in the legislation was to amend a number of other pieces of legislation. I pointed out at the time that this sort of omnibus approach, whilst it might be convenient for some, is most inconvenient for others, including those who want to have access to and study the legislation and those who may have to go, for example, to the Human Services and Health Act to see amendments to the Child-care Rebate Act. </PARA>

I am pleased to advise that, in response to concerns raised by opposition senators in recent discussions, the government can assure the Senate that, firstly, only a small minority of Austudy clients are expected to be affected by the test. Around two per cent of the Austudy client base is expected to be ineligible for Austudy under the actual means test. Secondly, the majority of clients subject to the actual means test will need to complete only the four questions on the Austudy application form which will provide a broad picture of their overall financial circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the actual means test will take into account the means of the student applying for Austudy, the means of the parents or partner of the student, whether there are any dependent children in the family under 16 years of age and whether there are any full-time dependent students in the family aged 16 to 21. Fourthly, the actual means test will not target parents on the basis of their choice to send their children to non-government schools. Fifthly, the government will publicly release a review of the actual means test within the first two years of its operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also make clear in response to a further concern, which was raised by Senator Baume, that families subject to the actual means test will not be precluded from Austudy solely on  the basis of bona fide gifts from otherwise non-assessable family members given solely for education purposes and not exceeding $6,000 per annum in total for each dependent student aged 16 to 21. For its part the government believes that the actual means test is a fair, equitable and cost effective method of ensuring that Austudy assistance is provided only to genuinely needy families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austudy is aimed at students from the neediest sectors of society. For example, for a 16-year-old person living at home in 1995, the standard rate of Austudy normally cuts off at a combined parental income of $31,687. This represents a take-home income of $24,727. The actual means test responds to community concerns that a small number of students get Austudy even though their families clearly have financial resources well in excess of the take-home pay of the Austudy target group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actual means test applies to all students who have a parent or partner in one of the designated groups.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The test does not apply to families where parental or spouse income is drawn exclusively from wage and salary or pension sources. The real means of such families are adequately assessed by existing Austudy income and assets tests.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The four key expenditure questions on the Austudy application form provide a broad overview of the family's circumstances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The disallowance motion has been demonstrated to have served a useful purpose. The coalition is far from convinced that these regulations are in what we would call a satisfactory form. Nevertheless, as a result of the assurances that have been given, the application of the tests will be more satisfactory than would otherwise have been the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine's notice for disallowance has lead to a debate that has taken place in this chamber and out of this chamber that has improved the situation for some Australian families and, therefore, I recognise it as a worthwhile initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to recognise the work that has been done by my colleagues Senator Baume and Senator Tierney to improve the lot of Australian families that will have to face this new test. My colleagues entered into a process of consultation with the minister's staff and finally obtained from the minister the assurances that Senator Faulkner read into the record this morning. Whilst we believe that the situation is improved, we are still quite concerned about the application of this new test that will apply principally to the self-employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be unnecessary to say that we support the Austudy system, because I would have thought the whole world knew it. But, apparently, the Australian Labor Party has started a fear campaign in various universities around the country, telling students that when we come to office we will scrap it. That is just another Labor lie, Senator Faulkner, but we might as well take the opportunity to put it on the record in a clear and unambiguous way that we support Austudy. If the Australian people choose wisely and put us into office at the forthcoming election, the Austudy system will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also accept the concerns, particularly those that came out of the Senate standing committee, which called for better targeting. The government, of course, says that this is an initiative at better targeting. We obviously do not support rorting of the system and, in fact, the government claims that through these anti-avoidance measures it will be able to save some $29 million a year. That is yet to be seen, but it must be understood that when further and more complex tests are applied, not only do they involve more work on behalf of the families of those who are seeking the benefit but also there is the danger that some who justly deserve the benefit will be excluded as a result of the additional tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is whether the tests have been drawn in a way that is fair and adequately precise. In this instance, in relation to these new tests that are to be applied to the self-employed, there is a concern that comes out of their ambiguity and their extreme complexity. That is one of the concerns, and I think anybody who has sat down to read the formula contained in these regulations will only be shocked at the obvious complexity. One must wonder if it is not beyond the wit of our government and its bureaucracy to produce something that most Australians would be able to understand, because most Australians certainly would not be able to understand these regulations. That has to be of concern to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assumption that seems to underlie these regulations&mdash;that it is those who are self-employed and it is those in small business who are particularly rorting the system&mdash;is an assumption that the government does not justify on the basis of factual material. I guess in some ways it might just further demonstrate the prejudice of this government: that if there is an abuse, you first assume that it is an abuse by those who are self-employed, those who are in small business and those who are creating wealth and providing jobs. I think it is rather sad that it seems to be the natural assumption of Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond the issue of complexity, however, is the issue as to whether the tests, the further requirements that are being placed upon individuals, are reasonable. I think there is still room for very significant debate as to whether the government has gone beyond what is reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we must be conscious of the fact that if there is rorting, it has to be overcome and the taxpayers' dollar has to be protected. We have certainly approached this debate on that basis&mdash;to try to get the balance between what is fair to the taxpayer and what is fair to families who need the support of Austudy is, of course, a challenge that we accept. We have also been influenced by the statement of the government that, unless these regulations can be now settled, it will be impossible for them to be implemented for this next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On balance, in the light of the additional assurances that Senator Baume and Senator Tierney have been able to extract from this government, we have therefore decided that we will not support the motion. Notwithstanding the fact that the government says that the practice of the regulations will be reviewed within two years, if we are successful at the next election we will commence an immediate review of them; we will not wait for that two-year period. From the position of government we will want to be satisfied that they are fair, that they are not unduly intrusive and that they are not prejudicial to those who are self-employed as opposed to those who are employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the hesitant frame in which we say that we will not support this disallowance motion, we want to give those assurances. It is much easier, in many ways, to do a job such as that from within government than it is from opposition. We certainly undertake to do that upon coming to government. But, on balance and in the circumstances that I have outlined, we will not be supporting the disallowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;While I realise that I made a contribution when Senator Harradine moved the disallowance, we have had presented to us some further information which has addressed some of our concerns. It is important to respond properly to that. I am a member of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee which inquired into Austudy. We received submissions from the public and from interested parties. Mention has been made this morning that part of the concerns the committee raised were concerns that there was potential for rorting of the Austudy payments, and that potential existed in those who are able to manipulate their taxable income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee had a great deal of difficulty in getting beyond the anecdotal evidence. We actually found it impossible to gain from the public, from departmental witnesses, from dispassionate observers or from academics anything other than anecdotal evidence that such rorting occurred. Inquiries were made, and I must claim to have been persistent in those inquiries myself, but we were unable to obtain objective evidence as to how such rorting occurred, who was perpetrating it and how they were managing it. It is in response to the anecdotal evidence and not really in response to powerful objective evidence that was placed before the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems is that, while the general public might claim to know of somebody, proving it is another matter because if you could prove it then the rorting would probably not occur. In the light of that, we have this response that was embodied in the regulations to which Senator Harradine has objected. I have received assurances, similar to those which the minister has expressed today, from the department that this is the way in which that response will be driven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that these are assurances, and assurances from ministers have been received before. I am concerned about what the status of these assurances is and about what authority those assurances would have under the Acts Interpretation Act in the administration of the regulations as they stand in writing, in law. It is all very well under the Acts Interpretation Act to be aware of the intentions of the minister as expressed in a second reading speech, but this is not a second reading speech. The document tabled is speaking notes. We have a list which is quite specific and reasonably detailed. I think we could have asked for perhaps even more detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had bald statements but we do not have any indication of guidelines for the administration of the regulations and what will be put in front of officers. One thing which did emerge from the inquiry and did form part of our recommendations was the constant demonstration&mdash;real objective evidence&mdash;that there were hundreds, if not thousands, of incidents where the advice received at one level of the department administering Austudy was contradicted by advice given at another level, compromising the people applying for and people receiving Austudy to such an extent that quite often people had been in receipt of inappropriate amounts and had to carry the blame themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it plainly, we saw reason to recommend that there be a system implemented of recording advice in writing so that people receiving advice could demonstrate why they acted the way they did and why they were in receipt of the amount of money they were. So having recorded advice was one of our recommendations and increased training of staff was another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were impressed negatively by the complexity of the regulations and the administration, something Senator Hill has also pointed to. We also expressed a need to recognise the need for flexibility in the administration of the Austudy threshold points, in applying or not applying Austudy provisions, and in the calculation of incomes. This is really an expression of that&mdash;a flexibility. We have also introduced this concept of the means test. One wonders what the means test means if it is not an actual means test. I know what it means but when you are talking about regulations and accuracy, we have to be careful about definitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in the light of those things, I bring a greater uncertainty than the one Senator Hill has expressed. We have to emphasise the advantage that has been brought to us this morning by the actions of Senator Harradine in his moving to disallow these regulations. The reaction has been to provide us with assurances. I am questioning the status of those assurances. I do not know what the minister can do at this point to reinforce or amplify these assurances but we have to be very careful about accepting that this is the be all and end all of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to some extent satisfactory to see a reaction of this sort to Senator Harradine's motion to disallow. But I am very wary about expressing any faith in this being the complete solution because of the possibility, as was raised during the debate initially, of there being abuse of these regulations by the administrators to an extent which will deliver hardship and inequities to the recipients of Austudy. Those possibilities still remain and are not completely removed by these assurances. That is the problem. The problem has arisen because the gap&mdash;I think Senator Baume introduced that concept, and it is a very useful one&mdash;between what is intended as expressed by the minister and what is potentially to be delivered by the regulations is considerable. This assurance goes a long way towards reducing that gap. But I still remain to be convinced that it will mean the complete resolution of that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that I cannot suggest what the minister could do this morning by way of amplifying that assurance. It is his responsibility to convince us that the possibilities of the inequities which we described in the earlier debate will not happen. It is up to him to devise a way to not only assure us but also prove to us that it will not happen. I accept the assurances and the good faith in which they were prepared, but I remain to be convinced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on this debate. On balance, the Greens will not be supporting this disallowance motion. The fact that $28 million is expected to be collected by the government on this measure and that 12,500 students are expected to be cut off will mean that quite a lot more students would be required to fill out the form. That would work out to be a considerable compliance cost in relation to the small business community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years down the track would seem to be a long time to work out whether the compliance cost to the community is being balanced out by the increased revenue that the government is earning. I add my voice to the call that waiting two years would seem to be too long to make sure whether the way that this is being done is fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly have not seen a copy of the Austudy form in question, so it is difficult to know how long it would take a family of an Austudy applicant to fill out the form. If possibly 12,500 students are expected to be cut off, one would expect that a great deal more would be required to fill out the form. What kind of proof is required and so on is not something to which I am currently privy. It would seem a long time to wait. If there might end up being a couple of million dollars in compliance costs across the country, we would certainly like to find out in less than two years whether the government is collecting $28 million, whether people are being unfairly targeted and whether it is producing yet another compliance cost for small business. I am not against the principle that the government seems to be aiming at. However, we want to see its actual effect and how it operates. We would have appreciated receiving a copy of the form so that we could find out exactly what people are going to be asked to fill out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Battling Australians whose children are excluded from Austudy because they are not poor enough have every reason to be angry at rich people using sneaky devices to get Austudy for their children. Let us get this clearly on the record. That is the opposition's strong view. However, I commend Senator Harradine for moving the disallowance motion. I was keen to do so myself, but I am overjoyed that Senator Harradine did it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has provided us with the opportunity to narrow the gap, as Senator Bell pointed out, between what the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) said was the intention and what the Department of Employment, Education and Training came up with. Quite frankly, I do not regard these regulations as acceptable, reasonable or even decent. They are discriminatory and unfair. As Senator Bell said, we have narrowed the gap between the intention of the minister, which was to target bids, and what the department has done, which was, in the regulations, to hit one-third of total Austudy applicants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned, as is Senator Margetts, about the compliance costs. That emerges from a speech I gave a couple of weeks ago when this matter first came up. However, we have a double task. We have to resolve the conflict between the need to stop what is claimed to be $29 million of rip-off and the need properly to inquire as to people's means and whether they are entitled to Austudy. On the other side of the ledger, we must not impose an unfair burden on a particular section of the community, the section of the community that happens to be self-employed because, in many cases, they have lost their jobs under the recession we had to have; or who are in partnership, in many instances with their wives or other family members; or who have a share, no matter how small, in a proprietary company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there was an example of how not to prepare a set of regulations, it seems to me this is it. Here we have the minister targeting a narrow group, two per cent of Austudy recipients, who are claimed to be rorting the system and you belt about one-third of applicants with, on the face of it, regulations requiring presentation of massive detail as to expenditure and savings, some of which is grossly unfair because it does not take into account the costs involved in those expenditures. PAYE income is a net income to the recipient. Expenditure is gross expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle that has been applied in this matter is absolutely appalling. It represents a lack of basic understanding of or concern about that section of the community which is self-employed, or in partnership or has a share in a proprietary company. What a disgrace! Fancy having a share in a proprietary company! You must be a filthy capitalist! This attitude is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments adversely affect about one-third of claimants by reclassifying as designated parents who face an additional means test all parents or guardians who are self-employed, except farmers; who are in partnerships; who have an interest, no matter how small, in a trust&mdash;some superannuation funds are trusts&mdash;or a proprietary company; or who have overseas assets or income. That phrase `overseas assets or income' interested me. It appears from the evidence presented to the Senate committee that this may well be a major area of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Bell pointed out, there is no hard and fast evidence about where this rorting comes from. In my negotiations and discussions with the department I could get nothing other than anecdotal complaints from people who, quite rightly, might live next door to someone who drives a Mercedes Benz, who lives in a large two-storey house, who has a live-it-up lifestyle and whose kids are getting Austudy. I would have thought we could have done better than some anecdotal evidence. Nonetheless, I am intrigued about how the department got the view in the first place that $29 million was the amount of savings. Being a trusting chap, I am prepared to accept their broad brush view that about two per cent of people are rorting the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that to get these two per cent, these amendments to the regulations clearly discriminate against small business people without any evidence being presented that they are a major source of abuse of the system. As I have said before, the minister's press release and the report of the recent Senate inquiry suggest that permanent residents, rather than citizens of Australia with foreign assets, are the key target area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department did give me&mdash;and I am grateful for them&mdash;oral assurances that designated parents would only be required to answer four additional questions among the 70-odd in the Austudy form. There is no doubt that parents have to have received a decent sort of education to be able to cope with the form in the first place. This is required in order to establish the target group that will be obliged to provide full details of their expenditure and savings to establish their entitlement to Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the four questions that it is intended to be asked is: give details of your principal family home, the current market value and address. That is not information that is obliged to be provided by people who are PAYE income earners and who do not have these other `assets'. The second question is: give the current market value of any other properties or investments, including holiday houses and share portfolios in which any family member has a personal interest. Any family member. I am grateful that the minister has clearly indicated that that is a fairly limited question. We have got an assurance now about how you define family member. The question continues: include properties in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third question is: give details of current market value of any motor vehicle which any family member uses. I do not know whether a Comcar driver can be accused of using a motor vehicle if in fact he is entitled to drive that Comcar home after work and to drive that Comcar to work the following morning. There may be many people in that situation who may well have access to a vehicle owned by the business they work for or, in fact, may be in partnership in a lawn mowing business and so on. Anyway, given those problems, I acknowledge the need for these lifestyle tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth question is: give the total education expenses, including tuition and boarding costs, for all family members in 1996, deducting any fees waived. The department describes these as four lifestyle questions, the answers to which, in combination&mdash;that is the key word&mdash;will provide a clear indication of those who are in the high risk group of Austudy abuse according to the department. We do not know because, as I said, apart from anecdotal evidence, we have not seen it. I am prepared to accept the department's view&mdash;they are experts in this area; they have been listening to complaints for a long time&mdash;that that is an area of risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerned me at the time was that the question on education, which is the only one on expenditure in that four, appears to target families with students in non-state schools, which is contrary to the strong finding of the recent Senate report that `any targeting of non-government schools in an effort to reduce rorts would be totally inappropriate'. Administrative procedures, in my view, such as these under the regulations, have the potential to cause the greatest discrimination. The regulations themselves are bad enough; the administrative procedures give a capacity to create greater discrimination. Unfortunately, until today, there were no directions, either in the regulations themselves, nor in any ministerial statement to the parliament or press release, to indicate how these discriminatory regulations should be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that I faced&mdash;and I do not know whether Senator Harradine or Senator Bell in particular are concerned about this&mdash;is that the department advised me that if these regulations were disallowed, it would be unable to implement any replacement regulations to stop the abuse for the 1996 year. Apart from anything else, it has distributed enough forms to cater for 500,000 Austudy places for the year beginning 1 January. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, the department created that problem. It is the department's fault. The normal processes of the parliament should be taken into account when departments are putting up regulations of this kind. The fact that Senator Harradine moved a disallowance motion does not excuse the department from not giving itself enough time to take this sort of thing into account. The department, in effect, took the parliament for granted and that is not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the coalition and I have no desire to block the end of the rorting of Austudy by cheats. We do not wish to put ourselves in a position, because we are saying that these regulations are not good enough, where people can get away with almost $30 million by ripping off taxpayers. That is why I was so determined to try and find a solution to the problem, and why I was so determined to try and get, if you like, a set of riding instructions from the minister to ensure that these regulations would involve the minimal amount of discriminatory activity that is possible whilst still achieving the objective of stopping the rorts. We have a conflict of principle here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the fact that the regulations are still unsatisfactory. I acknowledge the fact that the department fought tooth and nail to retain them unaltered&mdash;and I think that is a mistake by the department. I have had a very reasonable and decent level of cooperation extended to me by the department. We had many, many lengthy discussions, in one of which Senator Tierney was involved. We had many discussions extending over many hours both in my offices and on the telephone. I am grateful for the time given by the department. However, I found it unfortunate that the department appeared to be so determined to dig in its toes on some matters that I thought were indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I have to thank the minister and the Hon. Ken Reed in the minister's office for their very, very cooperative, rational and sensible approach aimed at trying to resolve these problems. The whole point of this sort of discussion is to resolve problems; not to dig yourself into entrenched positions. I hope that the department might have learnt a few lessons from the minister's office about how to do this. I did not find the way that the department went about things acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the burden of benefit does lie in allowing the regulations to stand, provided that we have the sort of ministerial statement that is now being made to the parliament which is effectively giving directions as to the implementation of the regulations. My understanding is that these assurances bind the secretary when he, under these regulations, has to satisfy himself that someone who is a designated parent has not in fact exceeded the equivalent income level for someone who is a notional parent&mdash;in other words, a normal parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, as Senator Bell says, he is reluctant to accept assurances, I can only say that we will find out, when we have our inquiry into this early next year from government, whether in fact the secretary has felt himself bound by the ministerial instruction. I might say that any secretary of any department who did not find himself so bound would presumably be looking for another job under the sorts of arrangements that now exist in the upper echelons of the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a threat; that is just stating the reality. The parliament is seeking to bind the secretary in getting this assurance. Let there be no doubt about the intention of the parliament if these regulations are passed. Let there be no doubt about it at all. This debate itself normally must be taken into account in any disputes over these matters before any tribunals, such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sought an assurance that the regulations would not be used to target parents of students solely on the basis of their children attending non-state schools. Apart from the discriminatory nature of the regulations as they appear in terms of self-employed people, there was a clearly different treatment of people in non-state schools as against those people in state schools in the sense that expenditure on education was singled out as the only expenditure item in the four lifestyle questions. I am very glad to see the way the minister has recognised those concerns and acted upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, I want to say how much I appreciate the letter I received this morning from Mr Free. I sought an assurance that the regulations and the administrative arrangements are aimed at only about two per cent of Austudy applicants so that only a small proportion of designated parents will be required to provide full details of their expenditure and that this targeted group will be determined on the basis of no more than four lifestyle questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response from the minister was that only a small minority of Austudy students are expected to be affected by the test, about two per cent of all Austudy clients are expected to be ineligible for Austudy under the actual means test and the majority of clients subject to the actual means test will need to complete only the four questions on the Austudy application form which will provide a broad picture of their overall financial circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister gave me an assurance at my request that the actual means tests and question 70 take into account the means of the student applying for Austudy, the parents or partner of the student, any dependent children in the family under 16 years of age and any full-time dependent students in the family aged 16 to 21. In other words, if a grandmother, an aunt or whoever it happens to be decides to pay the school fees of the student, that person is not a member of the family for the purposes of the actual means test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sought, and got, an assurance that the actual means test will not target parents on the basis of their choice to send their children to non-government schools. In other words, that test alone cannot be the only test which excludes someone from receiving Austudy. The minister gave me an assurance that the government will publicly release a review of the actual means test within the first two years of its operation. As Senator Hill has already said, we will do that a lot quicker when we reach government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had also wanted to make certain that if a grandmother, an aunt or someone like that paid a child's education expenses, particularly at a non-government school, that is not counted against that student applying for Austudy because it is not counted against the student, up to a limit of $6,000, of a PAYE taxpayer. All I was seeking to do was to get rid of the discriminatory treatment of a self-employed person as against someone who is simply a PAYE taxpayer or benefit recipient, because something like 40 per cent of Austudy parents are in receipt of benefits. I wanted there to be no discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say, it took a long time for me to convey this view effectively to the department, which disappointed me. In any event, the minister and his office readily recognised the merit of what I was saying and, as a result, they have given me an assurance. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After consideration I am prepared to give the further undertaking that families subject to the actual means test will not be precluded&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>I am very pleased indeed that all these concessions have been made. They make these regulations, if I can use the expression, less worse. They are not ideal; they are less worse. They are significantly less worse than they were. I hope that the experience the department has had in dealing with the parliament over this and the clear expression of the parliament's views&mdash;which I think are evident from the minister's own statement and what has been said in this chamber&mdash;will encourage the department to act with discretion and reasonableness in its administrative procedures. It is under instructions to do so. I can assure the department that we will be watching and that we look forward to that scrutiny to ensure that it is doing so as soon as possible. </PARA>

I want to assure the Australian Parents Council, who are very unhappy indeed about Austudy regulations&mdash;not specifically these ones but a whole range of Austudy regulations&mdash;that we share a great deal of their concerns and will be examining this matter in office very closely indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be a better way of doing it than the bureaucratic nightmare that seems to have been thrust upon us by the department so far, a nightmare which we have had to try to resolve, I hope not just by taking appropriate bromide but, in effect, by instructing the department to act in a particular way so the evidently discriminatory nature of the regulations will be offset by administrative instructions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been instructive to me as well. I hope that those designated parents, self-employed and so on, will not be disadvantaged in any way under these less worse arrangements that we have been able to successfully request from the government. If any such parents are disadvantaged and if any parents of children attending non-state schools are disadvantaged I can only ask that they advise the opposition of that disadvantage. That will help, I would hope, to ensure that the regulations are implemented the way the parliament wants them to be implemented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It falls to me to close the debate since I moved the disallowance. It is certainly not my intention to canvass all of those matters that I canvassed on the last occasion, but I need to respond to what the minister has said in this chamber today. We are faced with a very grave situation. As a Senate we should be very careful about our consideration of it. The matter was raised by Senator Bell in his contribution as to the legality of what is likely to take place. It has been raised by Senator Baume. The cost of it all has been raised by Senator Margetts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go over the matters that I raised before. It was quite clear that the intention of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) was to ensure that certain alleged rorting was prevented, which is a very commendable intention, but his intention clearly was not reflected in the regulations. I moved this disallowance because they imposed an unfair, discriminatory burden on certain designated parents. The fact that the regulations did not reflect that intention has required the minister to now say how the regulations will be administered. His representative came in here and put on the record of this parliament how these regulations will be administered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we now have regulations that do not mean what they say and we have now had the minister saying what they mean. That causes, and will cause, considerable problems. It certainly causes me a problem. I would have thought it ought to cause the government, and indeed the opposition, to further consider the matter. No matter who wins the next election, you should not have a situation where the regulations do not mean what they say to such an extent that the minister's representative has to come into this chamber and say what they mean by saying how they will be administered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain aspects of what the minister has said in relation to how the Austudy regulations will be administered conflict with what the actual regulations say. For example, in relation to questions 67 to 68 the minister says, `The majority of clients subject to the actual means test will need to complete only the four questions on the Austudy application form which will provide a broad picture of their overall financial circumstances.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question 67 states: `Give the following details of your principal family home: current market value and address.' Question 68 states: `Give the current market value of any other properties or investments, including holiday houses and share portfolios, in which any family member has a financial interest, include properties in Australia and overseas.' Question 69 states: `Give the details and current market value of any motor vehicle which any family member uses.' Question 70 states: `Give the total education expenses, including tuition and boarding costs, for all family members in 1996.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the minister is saying that those questions will satisfy the secretary of the actual means of the designated parents, as he is required under regulation 12K. Of course they will not. How can they? There are certain details of expenditure which are not asked for in those particular questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the Senate that the regulations actually mean that self-employed persons and those in the designated group are subject to a means test based on their total expenditure without any allowance for the cost of earning their incomes. How could the secretary, by reading the responses to the four questions, make the assessment required to be made under 12K? For example, there is no means of knowing if there are three overseas holidays per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is saying to the secretary that the answers to those four questions ought to be sufficient. I suppose in most cases they might be, but in some cases they might not be. We need to deal with the other legitimate expenditure that is made, for example, by the designated parents in the course of earning their income. I can see what the minister is trying to do in ignoring that expenditure and I commend him for trying to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to commend those people who have taken part in the discussions which have resulted in a situation which is a little more less satisfactory than what might otherwise have been the case. I do not want to knock that effort. I think the efforts of the minister, the department, Senator Baume and others who were involved are commendable, but I think we do have a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought Senator Baume said that, on his assessment, once the minister made his statement and it was on the record of this parliament then it was binding on the secretary. I may have misunderstood him. The High Court has ruled that the secretary has an obligation under the regulations to do certain things no matter what the minister says. This obligation is imposed on the secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is a very dangerous situation for the government to accept a situation whereby a piece of legislation or a regulation imposes a duty on, say, a secretary to a department and that duty is ignored. What this ministerial statement says is that the minister can instruct the secretary to do things that are not consistent with the regulation and the secretary is required to do that. What if the opposition wins the next election?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is creating a very bad precedent I believe, so much so that I think it ought to have a look at amending the legislation. I appeal to you that there are two ways that we can go about this. The first is to send the matter off to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to see whether the statement by the minister does reflect fully the obligations that are imposed by the regulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator O'Chee but, with respect, I cannot see how it is. Let us have a look at another example: the regulations require the secretary to determine the designated parent&mdash;12L&mdash;and it goes on in 12L(1)(b) to talk about having an interest in a proprietary company or an unlisted public company or having an interest in a trust. An interest in a trust could be an interest in a superannuation fund because most superannuation funds are trusts and that opens, really, a Pandora's box. The minister is saying, `Don't bother about superannuation funds', but some of them are trusts. I am saying there is example after example like that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I would have liked to move that the statement of the minister be referred to the regulations and ordinances committee for that committee to consider whether or not those examples and the statement are consistent with the regulations themselves. Bearing in mind this very important principle we are talking about that if a regulation that is approved of, or not disapproved by this chamber, imposes an obligation on a particular person, in this case the secretary, then we should not have a situation one way or the other where the minister can order that the regulations be administered in such a manner as would interfere with that obligation. That is what I am getting at. I am not going to move that, by the way, but I would hope you have a think about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am trying to. The amendment I want to withdraw has a number at the top, which is cw/3957/Cha-1. I would like to replace it with the amendment which is numbered cw/3965/Cha. I will just explain to my colleagues why that is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both of the amendments relate to the impact on this particular legislation of the legislation which, it has been foreshadowed, will be coming into the parliament and which is the government's legislative response to the Teoh High Court decision. The reason I am withdrawing the first amendment is that it was a very harsh and blunt way of demonstrating how wrong I believe the government's legislative response is. In fact, the amendment with which we have replaced it is a far more conservative and subtle way of demonstrating those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the amendment is presented because I once again wish to highlight the retrograde impact of the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1995. The withdrawal of the original amendment, as I said, represented a mistake on my part of circulating it, but it is useful to illustrate the problem that we have. The Greens want to show up the fraud the government perpetrates on the Australian community when it signs treaties in an international spotlight of virtuousness and then reneges on the commitment back at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My original amendment was an overly blunt attempt to show that. It was an attempt necessitated by the void that exists in Australia's international treaty procedures. We have no effective and comprehensive mechanism for consultation, scrutiny and implementation of international instruments, and that is really what the debate in this area should be about, rather than to propose legislation that makes the problem even worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what we really want to do, which is the substance of the new amendment which has been circulated, is affirm in law the very modest doctrine of legitimate expectation and have honourable senators put on the record why they support or oppose this aspect of the common law. So this bill and the government's ongoing commitment to implementing the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer are commendable. The convention and protocol are in this case being used as they should; that is, as a minimum set of standards, not a maximum. However, this is rarely the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance, I am moving an amendment which simply affirms in law what the common law has been saying since 1969: that Australian citizens should have a legitimate expectation that if Australia becomes party to an international treaty, then we will conform to its provisions. Where a decision maker does not act in conformity, then they have an obligation to give notice and provide an opportunity for a person affected by that to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The doctrine of legitimate expectation is such a modest principle that it is very hard to fathom why the government wants to stamp it out&mdash;until we look further. The only conclusion which can be drawn is that the government wants to continue to perpetrate the sham of being an upstanding international citizen while never needing to honour its obligations except at whim and, what is more, being able to blame it on a recalcitrant opposition or on a recalcitrant Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is really a win-win situation for governments. They can look good internationally and then, when they cannot do anything about it&mdash;when they have no capacity to influence administrative decision making until they have actually enshrined in domestic law&mdash;they can blame it on the sluggishness of domestic parliaments. It is not good enough. As the Greens, the coalition and the Democrats have pointed out, our treaty making process is fundamentally flawed. We may believe this for different reasons but what we need here is a debate on a comprehensive approach not a piecemeal one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though this bill that we are talking about&mdash;the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill&mdash;is exemplary in terms of implementing our obligations, this amendment is still required and will be required because the amendment addresses the timelag problem. That is, between the time when the international treaty is in place and domestic legislation comfortably comes into place to enforce it, there needs to be some capacity for administrators to need to take the implications of that treaty seriously and at least consider it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no obligation that they are forced to abide by because it is not yet in domestic law. However, if we say they have no obligations at all in relation to the treaty, it will then negatively affect any changes we might be able to bring to bear in the domestic law. This bill, because it does want to move in relation to the international treaty, is a good example of why we need the legitimate expectation principle enshrined within the bill; so that administrators do have that kind of notice that they must at least consider whether the decisions they are making are in conformity with an international commitment which we are aspiring to put into international law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the amendment is to ensure that a legitimate expectation will exist from the time that Australia signs the treaty&mdash;we mention in the amendment the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer&mdash;and not wait until it is legislated for. I am very keen to hear from senators as to what their objections are to the doctrine of legitimate expectation and its application in this case. I am really sorry that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) has missed my convincing arguments. I seek leave to move two amendments together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have raised in this chamber on a number of occasions the inadequacies of the way in which international treaties are dealt with and also, by the same token, the way in which intergovernmental agreements within Australia are dealt with in the national parliament in that they do very often bypass the proper democratic processes of the parliament. We have seen that on a number of occasions where we have been told that we cannot amend or change a particular piece of legislation because it has been agreed between the Commonwealth and the states or that we cannot change a particular piece of legislation because our bureaucrats&mdash;not even our government&mdash;have gone overseas  and agreed with foreign governments that certain things will occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our attitude has always been that, when we enter into those international agreements, which we often do for very good reasons, at the very least they should only be the minimum conditions and that Australia should have a perfect right to pick up the broad principle&mdash;in this case, the principle of protecting the earth's ozone layer&mdash;and move beyond that if we choose. Of course, parliament should retain the absolute sovereign right to modify those undertakings in any way it thinks fit. After all, in a representative democracy we are the representatives of the people and have that responsibility. We have raised those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the other principle brought out by the Teoh case, namely that there is a broader and legitimate expectation in the community that where the government has entered into an international treaty or an agreement, despite the fact that there is no domestic legislation to give effect to it, the people in this country should have and can have a legitimate expectation that the government has expressed a genuine intention to give effect to that treaty; and that can have some force in legal argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Picking up on what Senator Chamarette said earlier, in this particular case we have, in fact, moved well beyond the Vienna convention and well beyond the Montreal protocol, so the issue of whether we are or are not meeting at least the minimum conditions does not arise; we are already exceeding those conditions. For that reason, I was a little concerned with Senator Chamarette's original amendment because it might have tied us to conditions which are less than the conditions that we had already implemented. That would have been really quite disastrous. Now that the wording says `does anything less than implement the requirements of the convention and the protocol', I am very happy with it. I really cannot see any reason why the government should not accept this as an amendment, given that we are already going well beyond that and that, in fact, it is a claim which was made repeatedly in the minister's second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would point out that in some respects, the Vienna convention is somewhat more broadly drawn than the protocol. I see some advantages in that. I hope that would not give the government any cause to vote against this amendment. The convention, which has 152 parties to it, does not expressly refer to ozone depleting substances; it requires the parties to `take appropriate legislative and administrative measures to protect human health and the environment against ozone depletion and cooperate in scientific research and formulation of measures and protocols'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the beginning of a process. One reading of it is that it was more broadly drawn than the protocol and the Australian legislation which has been built on it. Nonetheless, I would argue that it would still be very valuable to bring those broader interpretations into consideration in Australian legal debate. Whether or not those additional factors are given effect within Australian legislation, they are certainly not in this package of amending legislation that we are dealing with today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is an excellent idea. It should not cause any concern to government. The only argument that government might bring up is that it does not want to see this as a precedential matter with respect to other bits of legislation. I suspect that the minister might be wanting to put that sort of argument. Coming back to the arguments that have raged to and fro over the Teoh case, if we enter into international agreements, whether or not we have given effect to that in our law, citizens of the world&mdash;not only Australian citizens&mdash;should have some reasonable expectation that that is the genuine intent of government and that should have some force in arguing legal cases.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The treaty bandwagon is becoming exceedingly crowded as it moves out of the station. So many people around this chamber are very concerned about treaty making operations and their implications for Australia. Although the passengers on this train may hold a variety of views and be coming from a variety of directions, it seems that only one person left at the station&mdash;the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans)&mdash;seems to think we are in the best of all possible worlds. Senators may recall that I have raised with Senator Evans and others the fact that the implications of international treaties are important for Australia. Therefore, they have to be very carefully considered. The ramifications of these treaties go far wider than the government was prepared to concede at the time. Subsequent events have indicated that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the rule of law is one of the great features of our community. It is ingrained in our system. It is not always observed.

If we want to protect the institution of the rule of law in our society, people have to be satisfied with law making activities. Where we believe that law should apply to our community, we want to make sure as a democracy that our people are involved in some way. There will be debate on how that involvement comes about. But there is no debate on the general principle that people should be involved. The government has persistently denied that issue as well. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made this point yesterday, and I make it again: it is time that Senator Gareth Evans and his advisers addressed that issue and came up with a fuller and more frank approach to this parliament. I believe that when this period and activities of the government are reviewed he will come out very poorly. In some cases we have seen almost secret treaty making activities. Treaties have been signed before elections, never announced to the public and then used as heads of power. I refer to ILO Convention 158. </PARA>

I can see the direction you are coming from in that you wish to make sure that the international convention is applied.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise not only to Senator Kemp but to all people in the chamber. He is quite correct. There was no deviousness on our part to fail to circulate or to mischievously circulate an amendment that we would have no expectation of anybody agreeing with, except that it would allow us to make the point. We attempted to address the possible implications of the government's response to the Teoh case so that we could protect the spirit of this bill. We apologise for the lack of notice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp said he would have a respect for the rule of law. You expressed other sentiments we agree with. We agree that we need a comprehensive process in place in relation to our international treaties and the way in which parliament can scrutinise them. However, I hope that your respect for the law also applies to the fact that all this amendment does is simply make explicit that which the High Court decision in Teoh actually made explicit, which is that it has always been a part of our common law to have a legitimate expectation and it has always been a procedural, not a substantive, right that a person should be able to query a decision that did not seem to be in conformity. We would not need this amendment if we did not already know that there is a possibility of legislation coming in which would make the current situation far less beneficial in terms of honouring what this act is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point Senator Kemp made is a very good one. It was answered by Senator Coulter. As Senator Kemp pointed out, this bill is in advance of our international treaties. It would certainly have been possible, under my previous amendment which has been withdrawn, for anybody to challenge administrative decisions and say that they are in excess of what our international treaty obligations are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two things to say about that. First, if somebody felt they wanted to challenge it, then they would have that right. And they should have that right. I am sure that Senator Kemp would not want to take that right away from them. However, I have phrased the amendment in a certain way to say that the fact we are a party to these two conventions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">gives rise to a legitimate expectation, on the part of any person, that, to any extent that this Act does anything less than implement the requirements of the Convention or the Protocol . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, we are protecting the progressive stance that we have already taken, but we are protecting it to the degree that, before we move to put it in law, we can actually check its compliance with the international covenant. We can then have that vehicle for repeal if we fall below the standards or the requirements of the convention or protocol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wording of the amendment does not allow the challenge if it is `higher than'. But I presume unless we take away the procedural rights, which we may well do in this anti-Teoh legislative bill, we are not interfering with a person's right to query it. Because of its phrasing, it is interfering with the person's right to be able to support it, I suspect. There is nothing in this amendment that should not be able to be supported at this point in time. The only reason for it not being supported would be if the government and the opposition were intending to undermine our legitimate expectations in response to conventions and an administrative and procedural right to challenge decisions made that are not in conformity with those conventions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know how Senator Kemp intends to vote on this issue, but I simply want to add to what Senator Chamarette has said. If Senator Kemp's concern is fundamentally about too many international treaties and conventions being entered into with or without proper parliamentary scrutiny&mdash;perhaps the concern is that there are just too many&mdash;I put it to him that recognising the legitimacy of those international conventions within Australian law may well have the effect that he is seeking, which may be different from that of other people in this chamber. He may be seeking to alert government that it has to be doubly careful in future about entering into international conventions lest it gets caught out. If Senator Kemp is minded to vote against this amendment and if his objective is to see fewer international treaties and conventions entered into by Australia, he might achieve that by supporting this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have pointed out, the act and the amending bills that we are dealing with here go beyond the convention and the protocol. If this clause is inserted, at some future time&mdash;as long as the clause is in there&mdash;the government will be stopped from dropping below those minimum standards. I think that is valuable. It puts in place a stopgap, a safeguard. I do not think government has any intention of dropping below those standards. They have, as we have all said, exceeded those requirements. But it puts in that safeguard and prevents the government from dropping below those reasonable expectations which are built into the convention and the protocol. So for that reason I urge Senator Kemp to bring his party on board and to support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the contributions in this debate have been well made. I think the Teoh debate is another debate. I can see how you have connected it into this bill, which in some ways is a bit awkward because, as we have noted, the bill goes further than the international convention. I certainly welcome the interest that people are now showing in this issue. Some of us felt we were a lone voice a couple of years ago, but I think the GATT bill and a few others have raised the understanding that this is a wider concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened carefully to the arguments. I am still not entirely convinced that the amendment will achieve exactly what the senators hope it will achieve. The minimum standards in this bill, on my understanding, are largely set in the bill itself. If the government wished to fall below those minimum standards it would have to bring a new bill into the parliament. It is this bill which sets some of the key standards. If the genuine fear is that this government, or a future government, might fall below these standards, we would have to bring a new bill into this chamber. Senator Faulkner will not be there, but if a future government decided that it would not abide by these standards it would be in breach of its own law. I am not clear that the logic remains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not too sure of the extent to which you elevate a further international treaty. Perhaps you might open up grounds for someone to produce perverse results which we would not accept. I will be very interested in the minister's reflections on this issue because I know that he has been very carefully following the debate. My feeling is that we are bringing in another very important debate. It is a debate that perhaps should be had elsewhere. I am not convinced on the basis of the arguments that this amendment will assist in any way in protecting the bill. It may open the door to producing perverse results. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem is that the act could be amended at some later stage to fall below international obligations. This amendment would make sure that we could not administratively do that. If it is passed we are stuck with it. This would operate on the way in which administrative decisions would be made in between any change and would actually protect the act that we have in place at the moment until such time as it is repealed. That is the point of having it. Whilst I appreciate that we would not want it to be used perversely, I am not anticipating that that will happen at all. All I am saying is that it is perverse to remove a legitimate expectation and a procedural right that could protect the spirit of the laws that we enact in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Kemp makes something of a reasonable point when he argues that there will soon be another bill for debate before this chamber in relation to a number of the issues that have been canvassed, including the Teoh bill. I think that was accepted by Senator Chamarette in her earlier contribution. That bill has passed the House of Representatives and has been examined by a Senate committee. It will be a matter where senators will be able to make contributions in this chamber in the very near future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will be opposing the amendment proposed by Senator Chamarette. The proposed amendment gives the convention and protocol direct legal force. In the government's view, that is inappropriate. It is an important principle that international conventions do not have legal force in Australia other than through legislation passed by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Usually, the provisions of conventions are unsuited to a simple incorporation as part of domestic law. This is because the language of a convention normally will allow a country some scope in the manner in which it is implemented. This is certainly the case in relation to the Vienna convention and the Montreal protocol. I think a good example of what I am speaking of is article 2.2(b) of the Vienna convention, which provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end the Parties shall, in accordance with the means at their disposal and their capabilities:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>

<PARA>I think that is a good example of a provision that is unsuited to be given the force of domestic law. The provision contemplates that governments will enact legislation to give effect to our obligations under the convention or protocol and also uses terms which clearly contain an element of discretion, such as `in accordance with the means at their disposal' and `appropriate'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do think the arguments against the proposal of Senator Chamarette in this case are strong. Senator Kemp makes the point that the legislation we have before us goes further than the convention and the protocol. Both Senator Chamarette and Senator Coulter in their contributions accepted that that is the case. We can go to areas such as aerosol bans; bans on CFC refrigeration and airconditioning equipment; the earlier halon phase-out; a lower limit on HCFCs, a path allowed under the protocol; and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the case that the Australian position contained within our legislation is stronger than that embraced within the Vienna convention and the Montreal protocol is an open-and-shut case. I accept that that was accepted by all speakers in relation to this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not comment, Senator Kemp, on the other point you made. I thought you did mangle your metaphors a little when you started to talk about the treaty bandwagon and then had it pulling out from a station and about the passengers in the carriages and so forth. It was a rather mangled metaphor, but I suppose that was because it was in some part an attempt&mdash;very unfairly, I think&mdash;to criticise my colleague Senator Evans. I was disappointed that you brought the debate down to that level, Senator Kemp. </PARA>

But there are also aspects of the protection clause that relate to high altitude aircraft and missiles that are not covered in this act. So certain aspects of the Vienna convention are not covered in this act. There are certain ones, particularly in relation to the protocol, where we are ahead. All I am pointing out to the minister is that the very commendable standard that we have here, where we are in advance of our obligations, needs to be protected from now till the next time we improve it. There should be some capacity for administrative decision making to take that into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To choose a convention which we are already honouring in spirit and in technical reality means that the objection to the amendment from the opposition and the government is nonsensical. I could understand that if international treaties were forcing us to put aside our domestic law, Senator Kemp, you would have considerable concerns about that. We are not talking about that; we are talking about a situation where our law is actually in advance. We are allowing people the procedural right to query whether we are going in the right direction still as we make further decisions. So to honour our bill and our international treaty obligations is not moving in different directions. The amendment that is in place is simply to maintain and protect that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner, just one last thing. You had people making considerable fun of you and Australia's inability to maintain a high international profile on our climate change. This is an area where you are going to make treaties that cover our international obligations in relation to the environment. It would be a disgrace if people in the international arena knew that Australia were making international treaties which it had no administrative intention of following or being obligated to look at until such time as domestic legislation were to be put into place. This is fairly grave and will have an impact on anyone who is involved in international treaty making in future.

<PARA>These amendments are important because they create a limited extension of the act to cover replacements for ozone depleting substances which may be the specific or general subject of another international agreement. The amendment only extends Commonwealth powers to replacements for ozone depleting substances and only where another international agreement applies. It is taking the act a little further, but it is not taking it outside what we believe to be the general understanding of the spirit of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act in its current form only allows regulation of ozone depleting substances. While generally this is appropriate, where a non-ozone depleting substance is currently subject to specific restrictions under another convention or is currently subject to general restrictions, it is foolish to allow these substances to be used as a replacement for ozone depleting substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The classic example is the case of the hydrofluorocarbons. These are significant greenhouse gases with a global warming potential of several thousand. General use of these substances in an unregulated way will have serious implications on our ability to meet our obligations under climate change conventions&mdash;obligations which we are already struggling to meet and are unlikely to meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, several European nations are pushing for the European Union to adopt a policy of phase-out of HFCs and they are likely to succeed. They have also indicated that they will push for the inclusion of a phase-out under international climate change implementation agreements. Currently, hydrocarbons are available for many applications, and ammonia and other replacement substances are also beginning to be widely available and commercially adopted as standard. In such a case it would be foolish to allow industry to blindly adopt HFC technology at considerable cost when it may be subject to international restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome will have environmental implications if the agreement is an environmental one, but is liable to have commercial and trade implications in any case. So to allow industry or consumers to replace one substance with a second substance which will be phased out, especially when commercial alternatives are available, is foolish. To allow manufacturers to produce products using replacements that will lead those products to be banned in other countries will impose serious consequences on export industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 2 is a technical amendment to add two definitions: global warming potential and ozone depleting potential. With our proposed inclusion of a schedule for HFCs there is a need to define global warming potential since various figures or methods have been used internationally at various times. This establishes clearly the global warming potential as the figures given in the act. The figures are those provided by the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Science and should be considered the best currently available figures for a 20-year time horizon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no definition for ozone depleting potential, and various figures or methods have been used in a similar way at various times. So this will clearly establish the ozone depleting potential as those figures&mdash;which are generally at the high end of the range in the Montreal protocol&mdash;contained in schedule 3 to the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So given the variation between the ozone depleting potential in part 5 of schedule 1 and the ODP, or ozone depleting potential, as given in the Montreal protocol in schedule 3 and the lack of specific reference to ODP use under proposed section 10 for the calculation of ODP tonnes, it seems important to clarify that definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the ODP for HCFC 121 on page 21 is given as 0.04. Yet the ODP for the same substance on page 51 is given as 0.01 to 0.04. Adoption of the 0.01 figure would allow four times as much substance to be used, and an average figure would allow roughly double. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 14 simply refers to the HFCs which are set out as part of schedule 1. Amendment No. 3 on the same page relates to HFCs being consistent with other definitions such as HCFCs, CFCs and so on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my speech during the second reading debate I laid a great deal of emphasis on this very point: that, while this legislation is dealing with ozone depleting substances, many ozone depleting substances are also significant greenhouse gases. It is very important that we do not jump out of the frying pan into the fire and seek to solve one problem while we make another problem worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two reasons for that. Firstly, of course, one does not want to exacerbate the environmental problems of greenhouse by using substitute gases which are certainly less ozone depleting but which are greenhouse causing, then to discover down the track that we need to control those in yet some other legislation. Secondly, very importantly for industry and for the economy as a whole, it is quite silly to go down a track which involves vast investment in equipment, vast investment in literally millions of domestic refrigerators or large commercial airconditioning units or whatever, using technology which, in a few short years&mdash;because of developments in our understanding of greenhouse which are coming to light very quickly now&mdash;we will need to undo. That does represent a vast waste of the resources of the community. We simply should try to head those things off as far as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the amendments which have been put by Senator Chamarette are designed to do that. The first one, as she said, is to recognise that there are other criteria which need to be taken into account, even though this legislation is dealing with ozone protection. The second one provides some definition. I notice that there is an amendment to amendment No. 14, and I hope that has been circulated. At the bottom of that table, which is part VIII of schedule 1, it should state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Note: GWP figures are only for direct effects, and are based on a 20 year time horizon. The GWP for CO(2) is taken as 1</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the explanation to go at the bottom of the table which is in Senator Chamarette's amendment No. 14. I think it is even more important that I give some explanation to that table which appears there. As it stands, the global warming potential figures may well be somewhat meaningless to some people in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back to the ozone depleting potential, the Montreal protocol took the ozone depleting potential of CFC-12 as 1 and then related other substances to that. What that meant was that molecule for molecule, taking into account the resonance time in the atmosphere, other substances had a greater or less ozone depleting potential than CFC-1, so one could directly compare one substance with another with respect to its ozone depleting potential. So you could say that CFC-22, freon-22, if I recall, had an ozone depleting potential of 0.03&mdash;three per cent. In other words, if you are looking for the effect on the ozone of a release of freon-22, you could say that roughly 300 tonnes of that would have the same ozone depleting potential as the release of one tonne of CFC-12. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a similar way, one needs to recognise that the CFCs the HCFCs and the various other related substances are very potent greenhouse gases. The importance of this table lies in the fact that, while the concentrations in the atmosphere may be small, molecule for molecule they are very potent. I draw Senator Kemp's attention to the first one in that table, the CHF(3), or HFC-23, with a greenhouse warming potential of 9,200. What that means, Senator Kemp, is that one molecule of that substance in the atmosphere has a global warming potential 9,200 times greater than a molecule of carbon dioxide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, even though the concentration may be significantly lower, there is still the potential for it to be a global warming substance if the technology using these substances develops along similar lines to the way in which the CFC technology developed from the mid-1930s through until the late 1980s&mdash;namely, when equipment leaked the material was simply let off into the atmosphere. Yesterday, in your speech on the second reading, I think you yourself pointed to the enormous expansion of refrigeration in China which has 60 times Australia's population. If they use the wasteful technology that we have used over the last 40 or 50 years, then we are setting ourselves up for a very serious greenhouse warming situation. We should try to head that off as far as we can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are designed to recognise that we are looking at problems which go beyond ozone depletion. We are also looking at substances that have significant greenhouse effects, and they should be taken into account in this legislation. I understand that my further amendment is being circulated now. It simply identifies that, when talking about global warming potential&mdash;the words at the top of column 2 in that table, which is amendment No. 14&mdash;that takes carbon dioxide as unit one. It tells you that those substances have much higher degrees of global warming potential. The Democrats will also be supporting this group of amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can address that at a later stage. Senator Coulter, getting back to your issue, you have raised some very technical points. You have raised some points which, as a non-scientist, I would have welcomed the chance to further explore with you and to seek some advice. This relates, as well, to the amendments that have been moved by Senator Chamarette. My understanding of the amendments that we have before us is that they concern the issue of HFCs and HCFCs and how this bill should be dealing with those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will raise this issue and perhaps one of the senators who has spoken on this will address this particular matter. My understanding is that the use of HFCs and HCFCs is viewed as an interim strategy to maintain the air conditioning and refrigeration equipment following the removal of CFCs as a refrigerant option. I think that is the government's strategy&mdash;and Senator Faulkner is nodding. I think that is a strategy which most people felt at least provided an interim solution and dealt with a larger problem quite effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, in fact, these amendments are passed, does this mean&mdash;and I understand that it would&mdash;that we would have to replace HFCs and HCFCs with hydrocarbons? In other words, we would have to find alternatives for the uses for which they were going to be used. This is the advice that I have and I would like you to address it. The key alternatives to HFCs and HCFCs today are hydrocarbons, which are inflammable. Should hydrocarbons leak from the refrigeration system and a spark be present, explosion and fire may follow. Significant safety concerns exist over hydrocarbon replacements for this reason. HCFCs and HFCs&mdash;according to the advice I have, and I listened to your response&mdash;are the best technology at the moment as an alternative to CFCs. The implementation of the amendments would, in fact, remove this option. If that option was removed, would we be forced into alternatives which would pose an even greater threat to life and limb? Senator Coulter, perhaps you could address that concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I read these amendments, that is not quite the intention. I think you have pushed the amendments further than they intend to go. Two of the possible gases which would be substitutes&mdash;hydrocarbons and pneumonia&mdash;are both flammable. If you had a massive leak, you could have a fire. That is not the reason we are not going down that road. We have seen the development of substances which can be used within existing equipment. Compression ratios and various other things in refrigeration and airconditioning units can use some of these substitutes in existing equipment. It is the convenience reasons. I think I am right in saying there are 180 grams of working fluid in a typical domestic refrigerator. A slow rate of leakage would be extremely unlikely to cause any fire or hazard, even if all of it were to come out at once.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the advantages of ammonia is that it has such a horrible smell, unlike the CFCs and the HCFCs. Immediately it leaks, it is so pungent that one identifies the leak very quickly. Certainly with ammonia, which I mentioned yesterday, there is no possibility of slotting it into existing equipment. The intention, as I understand Senator Chamarette's amendments, is to recognise this other dimension to the problem and to head off the possibility that, given we are in a transitional phase, we do not go down a blind alley. We want to recognise that we are faced with another large problem. As far as we are capable of doing so, we want to head that off. It is sensible economic policy to try to recognise the options which are available to you in the future and make your investments in those areas in which you are not going to then have to pull back from those investments and make further investments. That is how I read the intention here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that we should be going back to the old ammonia technology with modern equipment. It was used prior to the 1930s and can be made extremely efficient. As I mentioned yesterday, the Peltier effect has been used in some small 12-volt refrigerators for cars and caravans. That has now been developed to a very high degree. It would give one the opportunity to have a domestic refrigerator work on a solar panel on one's roof, thereby creating zero greenhouse gas emissions. There would be no moving parts; it would be very efficient technology. Recognising that there are problems, let us not invest in technology from which we then have to pull back and make further investments.</PARA>

They only say no to HCFCs and HFCs in certain applications.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make one further point to Senator Kemp. The history of the way in which the ozone depletion debate has gone and the way in which industry has responded to that provides a very good object lesson for us in the matter we are debating here. I pointed out in my speech yesterday that, when the scientific evidence on ozone depletion became in my mind absolutely clear, by 1976 when the National Academy of Science in the US said, `We have a serious problem,' industry resisted that. We all remember the way in which they said, `We have no substitutes for pressure pack cans.' We went to hydrocarbons in pressure pack cans. They had warnings that you were not to use pressure pack cans near fires. That was 1,000 times more dangerous than a couple of ounces of hydrocarbon in a refrigeration compressor unit where you might get fractions of a gram leaking.</PARA></TALK.START>

Australia has been very good, since that legislation in 1988 or 1989, in dealing with the problem of ozone depleting substances. We are trying to say there is another emerging problem. If government is prepared to set the parameters or the guidelines, technology and industry are capable of responding. But don't leave industry in a limbo where they might go down a road thinking this technology is acceptable and find a couple of years down the track they have to change their patterns yet again.

The purpose of the act is to implement the requirements of the Montreal protocol to regulate ozone depleting substances. Other environmental impacts of replacements for ozone depleting substances, such as the greenhouse warming potential of HFCs, are appropriately managed through other mechanisms.

Cooperative industry agreements, monitoring and information programs will provide industry and consumers with the knowledge they need to make the best choices which are also environmentally sound from an ozone and a greenhouse perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While HCFCs and HFCs are greenhouse gases, they have global warming potential values less than the CFCs they replace. The emission of these gases has also been substantially reduced due to better maintenance and training of service mechanics. Current emissions of HFCs are small.

The States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1995 amends the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994, and gives effect to agreements made at the Premiers Conference held on 11 April 1995. This was an historical meeting, as honourable senators may recall, in that this agreement coincided with agreement by the state Premiers on the implementation of national competition policy. Competition policy reforms were a central theme of that conference. The government in its budget paper No. 3 for 1995-96, at page 4, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of the real per capita guarantee reflected the Commonwealth's desire to foster cooperative Commonwealth-State relations which would in turn offer a sound basis for working together to progress micro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA>It is worth remembering that the additional general purpose payments to be made by the Commonwealth to the states for the competition policy reforms will depend very much on satisfactory progress on implementation. Failure to do so will result in the per capita payment being retained by the Commonwealth. It will be the role of the recently established National Competition Council to determine whether the required conditions have been met by the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The payments, which are due to commence in July 1997, will be paid on a quarterly basis and indexed annually to maintain their real value, structured at $200 million in July 1997, increasing to $400 million in July 1999 and to $600 million in July 2001, all at 1994-95 prices, and therefore adjusted for inflation over that period. The payments will form a pool separate from the financial assistance grants pool and will be distributed on a per capita basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One may ask the relevance of these payments in the context of the bill before us. The point is simple. It is another example of the centralist Keating federal government creating conditions for the states whereby states are reliant on the goodwill and generosity of the federal government for their funding. This has an all too familiar ring about it. As I said at the outset, the last 10 years have seen a decline in assistance to the states in real terms. In marked contrast, the Commonwealth government's own purpose outlays have increased in all but three years, 1986 to 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A secure revenue stream is critical for the states. The Liberal and National parties believe that a fixed share of Commonwealth taxation revenue should be agreed upon, free of conditions, to restore autonomy to the states.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a new issue. It was flagged during the prime ministership of Mr Hawke but taken off the agenda by the present incumbent, Mr Keating.

The calls have, sadly, fallen on deaf ears. Mr Keating has shown absolutely no sympathy for the almost untenable situation in which the states find themselves, their funding squeezed by the Keating government, forced to cut some services given the insufficient funding provided and then blamed for an inability to provide an adequate level of service. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That 65 per cent of the increase compared with 53 per cent of the total grants for 1995-96 being tied compared with just 39 per cent 10 years ago is a very clear demonstration of the unhealthy trend against genuine federalism under this centralist Labor government. Furthermore, total payments to the states have fallen from 33.1 per cent of total Commonwealth spending to 25.6 per cent of total Commonwealth spending since Labor came to office&mdash;a reduction of more than one-fifth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two issues involved. Firstly, the amount provided to the states is insufficient given the revenue increases available to the federal government. The states are being squeezed while the federal government undertakes an uncontrolled spending spree. Secondly, by increasing the level of tied grants, the flexibility available to the states is reduced and the Commonwealth steadily but surely tightens its control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This state of affairs makes a mockery of state government mandates, with perhaps the exception of Queensland following the last state election&mdash;that is a government without a mandate if ever there was one. It shows contempt for the checks and balances of a federal system against centralised power. It denies regional flexibility and permits centralist interference in hospitals, schools, law and order functions, housing, roads&mdash;and now with the advent of national competition policy reforms&mdash;power and water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere is this more apparent than in section 15 of the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994. This section allows for funding to be recouped from states which have repealed laws proscribing compulsory student unionism. Not for the first time will the Liberal and National parties attempt to delete section 15 from the act. As I mentioned at length in the debate in this chamber on the Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill 1994 in December last year, the concept of compulsory student unionism is anathema to the Liberal and National parties and we will not resile from this position. These terms and conditions are incongruous with general purpose funding and section 15 should be deleted. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government relies on the Commonwealth Grants Commission to make recommendations on the provision of state government funding. The Commonwealth Grants Commission goes to extraordinary lengths, using some formidable formulae, to determine its recommendations and I have little complaint with that. The following statement is made in the main findings section of the Commonwealth Grants Commission's report on general revenue grant relativities 1995 update:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main role of the Commonwealth Grants Commission is to advise Governments on `per capita relativities'&mdash;the measure of the relative needs of States and Territories for financial assistance from the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>Per capita relativities will be applied to untied financial assistance grants and hospital funding grants. Similarly, a method of distribution of arterial road grants, which will increase in line with the consumer price index and population growth, will be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Untied road grants are a step in the right direction, but again only a small percentage of the funds collected by this federal Labor government in the form of fuel excise levies are returned to the states for road funding. When Labor came to office in 1983 some 60 per cent of levies were returned for this purpose. It has continually and persistently shrunk ever since that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Stuart Hicks, Director General of the Western Australian Department of Transport, earlier this year referred to our roads as an `asset worth about $1 billion'. He went on to ask and answer the following question: `Do we treat these road assets as a national treasure? No way.' To do so becomes exceedingly difficult for state governments are forced to make choices between competing portfolios&mdash;health, education, law and order and infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hicks's point that transport is central to our economic prosperity should ring loudly in the government's collective ears. There is very little in the economy which is not in some way affected by transportation costs. The Western Australian task force on road funding in 1981 identified a serious under-investment problem with our roads. Again, the federal Labor government is too blinkered to see the potential problems created by its neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put on the record some of the figures applicable to my own state of South Australia. General purpose payments to South Australia for 1995-96 will be $1,528.1 million compared with $1,486.1 million for 1994-95. These estimates as final figures will depend on the actual increase in the consumer price index for the four quarters to March 1996. The 1995-96 figure represents an annual increase for South Australia of $42 million, or 2.8 per cent. In addition, there is a $17.4 million payment for better cities funding, taking the total general purpose payments to South Australia to $1,545.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specific purpose payments to the states are estimated at $1,086.4 million and specific purpose payments to South Australian local government are estimated at $572.4 million. There is an additional direct payment of $6.6 million to local government. The total gross payment to South Australia will be $3,210.9 million and, after repayment to the Commonwealth of a debt of $109.3 million, the net figure is $3,101.6 million. This equates to a net dollar per capita funding level for South Australians of $2,095.80. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the government's Budget Paper No. 3, state governments raised around 58 per cent of their total revenue from their own sources.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1995 is not controversial and both sides agree to it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do want to make one brief comment about the philosophical argument that affects the small states. I am not surprised that Senator Chapman quotes Premier Goss from Queensland. Most premiers, whether they are Labor or Liberal, from the eastern states, the big states, are in one form or another consistently arguing that the grants money from the federal government, in any of its forms, should be distributed on a per capita basis. Ultimately, that would obviously assist them because they have a bigger population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this bill, I am advised by my officials, that the general revenue assistance on a per capita basis to New South Wales is $731.10 per person; to South Australia&mdash;my state&mdash;it is $1,032.60 per person; and the average is $864.90. Clearly, under the grants arrangements there has always been a recognition of states' needs, and this government and Prime Minister have been extremely strong in ensuring that there is a balance and the regional needs of the smaller states are taken into account in the allocation of funds to the states. I see Senator Calvert in the chamber. Under this bill, on a per capita basis Tasmania gets $1,393.80 per person, which is considerably more&mdash;over $600 per person more&mdash;than New South Wales. </PARA>

If the smaller states allow it&mdash;as I hope never happens&mdash;that we end up with a weak federal government that gives in to the pressure of the big, powerful eastern states, the three biggest states, over the allocation, I know the ultimate consequences will be less money for the smaller states as it is distributed on an even basis per capita at $864 per person, as in this bill. That would mean a loss in South Australia, in this bill, of $230 per person multiplied by 1.4 million. You can soon work out what we would lose.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the unprecedented intervention of Mr Bill Kelty in the Coles Myer saga by taking action which could only be designed to assist the interests of trucking magnate Lindsay Fox and his fellow Reserve Bank board member Mr Solomon Lew in questioning the basis for concerns expressed by the AMP Society. Given that Mr Kelty claims to represent the interests of at least some of the battlers, although clearly not the 760,000 unemployed, will the government indicate why Mr Peter Sams, the Secretary of the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council, is not absolutely right in saying that Mr Kelty's actions have nothing to do with the trade union movement? Are you happy to condone trade union supremos swanning around at Toorak dinner parties and running errands for the mega-rich rather than looking after the real interests of all those who are forced to pay membership fees to the ACTU?</PARA></TALK.START>

I know you are new in the job, but one of your responsibilities is to state government policy and government attitudes to issues of the day. Here you have someone who is a de facto cabinet minister and with whom you have just signed on for a seventh accord. So don't let's just pretend he is just another player in the game. He is very much someone with whom you and your government have a daily association. I am simply asking you whether you are going to walk away from him on this occasion, or whether you are perfectly content for your government to be associated with someone who is supposed to represent the working class, supposed to represent those who do not have $2 million homes in Woollahra. Do you see any problems with him intervening on behalf of Mr Fox and Mr Lew? Has Peter Sams not got it absolutely right when he says that Kelty's obligations are to look after those he represents?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook. Minister, I note media reports this week about the escape of the rabbit calicivirus undergoing trials on Wardang Island on South Australia's Yorke Peninsula. Could the minister explain how the CSIRO became involved in this work and whether there is any truth in the claims that there has been political interference in the project?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Burns for the question. A program such as the Australia and New Zealand rabbit calicivirus program is approved and undertaken only, of course, after significant examination and assessment. This particular program was developed to assess the suitability and effectiveness of rabbit calicivirus disease as a biological control mechanism for rabbits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rabbits cause very serious environmental damage, as I am sure senators know, and the damage is estimated at $100 million a year in lost primary production in Australia. Therefore, control of rabbits is an urgent priority for both environmental and agricultural reasons. Therefore, ultimate responsibility for the rabbit calicivirus program rests with two ministerial councils. These are the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand, and the Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program is managed by a committee which has as its members representatives of the two ministerial councils, the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, the CRC for Vertebrate Biocontrol, the CSIRO, the Meat Research Corporation, the International Wool Secretariat, the National Farmers Federation, and the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The government Assessment and Facilitation Committee of DPIE is an observer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding for the program is provided by the two ministerial councils, the Meat Research Corporation, the International Wool Secretariat, the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the Bureau of Rural Science. There is no funding provided by the CSIRO. There have been no funding cuts. Allegations of funding cuts are contrary to the facts and are not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSIRO is contracted by the management committee to provide quite specific services. These are to undertake strategic research and field trials. A three-year program of laboratory research was completed at the Australian Animal Health Laboratories before field trials began in March 1995 on Wardang Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The testing pen on Wardang was the subject of detailed design and safety and security protocols which had been developed by a research management committee and approved by AQIS. It had double rabbit proof fencing around the individual warrens as well as double rabbit proof fencing around the quarantined area. The site was, of course, located on an island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most regrettable that the virus escaped initially from the test site and then from the island. I can, however, assure the Senate that all possible measures are being taken to contain the virus. Indeed, I wish to put on record my appreciation for the work being done by the eradication and surveillance teams of Point Pearce, as well as that being done by the local Aboriginal community who have worked with these teams.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Responsibility for control of the outbreak now lies with the South Australian Department of Primary Industries in conjunction with the Consultative Committee for Exotic Animal Disease and in consultation with the Australia and New Zealand rabbit calicivirus disease program. Surveillance is now being expanded to six eradication units, and they are clearing the warrens within 20 square kilometres of Point Pearce. An information centre has been established in Adelaide, and a hotline has been set up to answer any questions that people may have.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone working on this program has been committed and professional&mdash;which is more than can be said for the media, who are seeking to make political capital out of what is a serious issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scientific evidence is that there is no danger to species other than the European rabbit. Containment at Point Pearce has been undertaken not because CSIRO believes that there is any risk to other species but because the approval to release the virus has not yet been agreed; and, if the virus is released, it would be in a controlled way to ensure its effectiveness. A decision for release has not been made and could only be made after the experiment is complete and following proper community consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no political interference in the research project, as was wrongly alleged on the ABC news last night. The coordinator of the RCD program, Mr Nicholas Newland, has today publicly refuted this allegation. Funding&mdash;particularly CSIRO funding&mdash;is not, and never has been, an issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Cook representing the Treasurer. Yesterday a major report confirmed that your government's regressive indirect and company taxes have contributed to income inequality, that the relative earnings of the lowest-paid full-time workers have declined and that the richest 20 per cent of families earn up to 13 times as much as the lowest 20 per cent and five times as much when government cash transfers are included. In the light of these findings, how can you have the gall to be party to the barefaced misrepresentation in your latest propaganda, which should have been called `Destroying the nation', that under your government inequality in earnings has not declined. The question is, Minister: isn't it a fact that, despite your propaganda, there is a widening gap between the rich and the poor?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Patterson asked me a question referring to a report unnamed, unsourced and unreferenced. The description of that report unnamed, unsourced and unreferenced bears no comparison to reports that I know have recently been  released on this issue. Until she designates what particular report she is referring to, I frankly do not know what she is talking about because the facts do not resemble anything that she has described in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that unnamed, unreferenced and unsourced report Senator Patterson draws a number of conclusions about the people in Australia, particularly the wealthy and the poor. I can say categorically that the evidence is quite clear on this subject: the rich are not getting richer and the poor are not getting poorer in Australia. That is the fact under this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When the coalition was in power it was not true because, in fact, the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. The attempts by the previous government to abolish a safety net, to do damage to the welfare structure in Australia, ensured that those in a position in society least able to protect themselves were the victims. The government of the day, the Fraser government&mdash;of which Mr Howard, now Leader of the Opposition, was then Treasurer&mdash;blamed the victims and penalised them for lack of incentive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not an approach that this government has. We have a safety net. We have a properly balanced welfare program. We adjust that program to protect individuals in a position in society not to protect themselves. Any allegation that the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer is not true. Perhaps this extraordinary piece of research referred to by the Senator&mdash;unnamed, unsourced and unreferenced&mdash;might shed some light on it, if only she had the courage to tell us what she is quoting from and what her references are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, which maintains a surveillance of the disparities between wealth and poverty in Australia, has constantly reported on this matter. The key findings of its report, many of which have been reported earlier, include that much of the growing income inequality evident up to 1989-90 was driven by changes in the inequality of market income; that changes made to the social security system during the 1980s&mdash;that is, by us&mdash;partially offset this market income inequality; and, further, that the change in inequality was again less once income taxes were included, with the income tax system having a greater effect on reducing inequality at the end of the decade than at the beginning. Those are the authoritative findings of this research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NATSEM agency undertook further analysis to estimate what happened up to 1994-95 and to take account of the social wage. The result of that analysis included that, in the 1994-95 year, the top 20 per cent of Australian families had market incomes that were about 13 times higher than the bottom 20 per cent of families and that the cash transfer system reduced this gap between the top and the bottom 20 per cent by just under five times. There is nothing in this question that suggests the honourable senator is referring to this authoritative research. It goes on: once the income tax system is included, the ratio between the top and the bottom falls by just under four times and, in NATSEM's estimate of the impact of education, health and housing subsidies, the ratio gets down to just under three times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I frankly do not know what the senator is talking about, but perhaps if she would address her attention to the authoritative research in this field she would learn something and she would cease this silly political provocation of pretending that a Labor government has no concern for the underprivileged when we have pioneered and built that concern into our welfare system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Now that the senator has identified the report, I can say she selectively quoted from it to misrepresent it, and the quotations I have made are accurate and put it into proper context. The second point is that my staff were on strike on Tuesday to participate in a national day of protest in the state of Western Australia, in solidarity with Western Australian workers, in opposition to the state government's anti-worker industrial relations legislation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The announcement by the United States Air Force to withdraw their F111 aircraft from service by around 1998 will make the Australian air force the sole operator of F111s in the world. A key priority for Defence has been the development of a strategy for ensuring the continued support of our own fleet. I have had several discussions with the US Defense Secretary, William Perry, firstly at the AUSMIN talks in April. There he indicated a very firm commitment to assisting us in maintaining our F111 capability. Secretary Perry confirmed this again when I met with him in Hawaii in September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to announce to and advise the Senate that when I met the US Secretary of the Air Force, Dr Sheila Widnall, yesterday she advised us of the United States Air Force's agreement to the pricing of F111 spares for the Royal Australian Air Force at just 10 per cent of their inventory price. This applies to the great bulk of unique F111 spares which USAF manages. Staff in the Pentagon are also working to achieve similar reductions for other spares managed centrally by the US Defense Logistics Agency. This special arrangement will result in a very significantly reduced cost and will make it much easier to secure the spares needed to support the fleet through its remaining years of service with the Royal Australian Air Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that some of the spares&mdash;the short life spares&mdash;will not be available through this and will be more expensive, but the very massive savings we have made on the more substantial and larger spares will go to funding these short life items. What we have done by purchasing another 15 ex-USAF F111Gs is extend the life of the fleet. We are involved in an avionics upgrade to bring them up to the most modern aircraft possible. The assistance provided by the United States on this matter I think is a further demonstration of the strength and closeness of our relationship.</PARA>

Telstra has advised that the company is developing an equipment scheme consistent with the proposal put before the commission.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen claims by Mr Baird about our visa system, its rationale and its operation. I say at the outset that not only are they ill-informed and ill-researched; they are also quite offensive. I do not think they do the Australian tourism industry any good. This is very much an irrational contribution to an important debate. By big-noting himself, Mr Baird is doing merely that in Tokyo at Australia's expense. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration is investigating this area. In the meantime, a number of questions need to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our starting point is that it is in the national and economic interest that we check people's health and character, whether they want to stay on, whether they are likely to work illegally and whether they will place an unnecessary burden on our asylum processing if they want to come to Australia. We are not alone in that respect. All countries want to protect their borders. The choice is very much whether they do so by screening before people arrive at a country or whether they do so at arrival at busy airports after long trips, which requires enormous resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country has had a bipartisan approach to visa checking. We have had that approach because we have decided as a parliament that it is smarter to keep criminals, people who abuse and people who have health risks out of Australia than it is to try to get them out once they are here. It is a continuing concern. Only during the last 18 months or so we have had cause, for instance, to deny visas to the Japanese nerve gas sect, the Aum Shinri Kyo sect, or the Supreme Truth, when they have tried on a number of occasions to get visas into the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are good reasons for having a visa processing system. We have been keen to use our resources to ensure that we have a faster and more efficient system. We have the most advanced system of visa processing in the world. We have worked at it with technology and resources. It now takes some 44 seconds, on average, for people to be processed at the border.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have worked at it by introducing agency arrangements in more than 16 countries, whereby people can get a visa when they apply and pay for their ticket. They can get a visa through an agency arrangement. They do not have to go to the Australian embassy. As Mr Baird should know, such agency arrangements have been operating through Japan and in Japan for some five years now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year we will be introducing electronic travel authorities which will make it even faster. In the course of this year, as I mentioned in this parliament a few weeks ago, we have introduced advanced passenger clearance systems with Customs and Qantas, whereby people spend some 20 seconds when they arrive at our borders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the impact of our current visa system? Senator McKiernan, if you look at tourism into Australia, we have had to handle a huge increase in demand. For instance, in 1984-85 one million tourists came to Australia. In 1994-95 that figure was up to some three million. From Japan, we are now getting some 720,000 tourists a year, worth $2 billion in export earnings. We expect that figure will increase to 1.2 million, almost double, by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this massive increase in numbers, we have managed to achieve a massive decrease in the number of illegal overstayers. Now we get 100th of the rate overstaying that we had a number of years ago. We have more efficient systems. I must say that we are doing it with reduced staff numbers. We now have 25 per cent fewer staff who issue 300 per cent more visas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear, with these facts in mind, Mr Baird has gone off half-cocked.

The government last year notified the Secretariat of the London Dumping Convention that Australia reserves the right to continue sea dumping of jarosite until the end of 1997.

I remind the minister that I asked him back in June to consider providing funding to help protect habitat areas in accordance with the wishes of many of the land-holders. As time is running out, I ask again: will the Commonwealth government be providing money to ensure sufficient habitat is preserved, or will it continue to stand by and watch the inevitable destruction of these species?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to say that more than 50 major Australian companies and industry associations have committed themselves to developing action plans to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions by joining the greenhouse challenge program. These companies represent a significant proportion of Australia's key energy users and producers. This announcement is an important step forward in meeting the challenge to reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. Our response demands a cooperative approach and I welcome the level of cooperation that industry has shown right from the commencement of this program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greenhouse challenge program of cooperative agreements follows industry's undertaking to join government in a partnership to tackle the greenhouse gas issue during the development of the Commonwealth's greenhouse 21C package. Cooperative agreements formed the major element of the package and it was estimated that they could yield in the order of 15 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emission reductions by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The companies who have committed to the greenhouse challenge will be known as the founding participants in the program and they have formalised this commitment by lodging a letter of intent. These companies and industry associations have shown leadership and I think they deserve recognition for the commitment they have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can illustrate the range and strength of the commitments given by Australian industries by perhaps just mentioning some of the broad cross-section that have joined up. The participants include the Business Council of Australia, the membership of which includes over 90 of Australia's largest companies; the Metal Trades Industry Association, representing 7,000 companies in the manufacturing, engineering and construction industries; and companies such as BHP, Goodman Fielder, James Hardie Industries Ltd, Shell and BHP.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Chris Evans for that very serious question. It is true that some data has been released recently on our exports to Asia which show, as you would expect, that over the last financial year our exports to this region have continued to grow despite the effects of the drought and despite the sluggish economic performance of our largest trading partner, Japan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, Australian exports to Asia increased by six per cent in the 12 months to June 1995, which made our total exports to Asia now $43.4 billion. To put that in perspective, 10 years ago it was $16.8 billion&mdash;$16.8 billion to $43.4 billion over the 10-year period. In the last year, the most important thing to note is that the growth has been across a range of sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I want to emphasise the growth in elaborately transformed manufactures, which increased by 10 per cent. They now account for 16 per cent of total merchandise exports. People always tend to say, `But off a very low base.' Going back to 1984-85, it was a low base. When we came into office, the base for elaborately transformed manufactured exports was less than $1 billion. But in 1994-95, they were $6.8 billion&mdash;a rise of 700 per cent, which is not a bad effort. We have almost made up for the years of the Fraser government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent Reserve Bank report noted that Australian manufactured exports to non-Japan Asia grew at an annual rate of 23 per cent in the decade 1985-94 and, in particular, in the area of processed food. The fastest growing area is in South East Asia where exports grew by 15 per cent to reach $10.5 billion, up from $2.2 billion in 1984-85. In North East Asia, despite the sluggishness in Japan, where our exports grew by only five per cent, in China and Korea they grew in both cases by a satisfactory 15 per cent. This is not a recent or an isolated event; it is part of a consistent pattern of growth which has been established since this government first came into office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The five-year trend of exports to Asia shows a growth rate of 9.4 per cent. This is one of the reasons why Australians can have confidence that the Australian economy can continue to grow, building on the climate of competitiveness and the export oriented industrial base and the export culture which has developed and which creates the opportunity for continued growth and, therefore, continued employment generation.</PARA>

The report was by Mr James Schofield, the ABC's science reporter. In the news item an edited version of an interview I gave live yesterday to the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World at Noon</EMPHASIS> program was used. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World at Noon</EMPHASIS>, I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is a strong body of opinion&mdash;not one that I subscribe to, but nonetheless respectable scientific opinion&mdash;that maybe the best thing the Government can do is let the virus run, because it will then meet the need that farmers cry out for in this country of dealing with the rabbit plague.</PARA>
<PARA>I draw attention to the words in that quote `not one that I subscribe to'. I also said towards the end of this interview, in response to another question and in relation to putting into context the possible danger to humans and other species of this virus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, again, I put against, that, a respectable body of scientific opinion is, `Well, now that it's out, why don't you let it go?'</PARA>
<PARA>The ABC TV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News</EMPHASIS> used this quote out of context. The point I made on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World at Noon</EMPHASIS> is similar to what I told the Senate in question time yesterday when, in answer to a question from Senator Ferguson, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that there is a body of respectable scientific opinion that says that the best thing that can happen now is to let the virus run. That is not my preferred position; I am certainly not in favour of that.</PARA>
<PARA>I also said this on the Murray McNicol program on radio 5AN in Adelaide yesterday. The James Schofield piece on the ABC TV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News</EMPHASIS> last night edited the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World at Noon</EMPHASIS> quote.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A respectable body of scientific opinion is, `Well, now that it's out, why don't you let it go?'</PARA>
<PARA>The reference was to part of what I said&mdash;and that was the only thing that was aired&mdash;not my view opposing the alleged respectable body of opinion nor any clear contextual meaning of what I said or what I believed about that opinion. The editing in the James Schofield piece made it sound to the innocent viewer as though I favoured `letting the virus run'. I do not. My view is, and I quote my words on radio 5AN yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . now that it has escaped there is also a respectable body of scientific evidence and farmer opinion that argues for let it run, because it doesn't harm humans, it doesn't harm other species. It deals with rabbits, they're the number one pest, and let it run. That's not my view. My view is let's complete the experiment in the proper way, give the results, make a decision, authorise its release.</PARA>
<PARA>My office has drawn this issue to the attention of the ABC TV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News</EMPHASIS>. Reporter Schofield agrees that the tape had been edited and my complete view had been omitted. But he also advised my office that he will not correct it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have caused this matter to be taken to a higher level of responsibility within the ABC and requested a response by question time. Just now, I have received a response. I am advised that the ABC's initial response states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC did not mean to imply in its 7.00 pm news story that the Minister supported the views of some scientists that the virus should be released. However, if the use of the briefer version of the Minister's description of that view led to an interpretation that the Minister supported this particular view, then that was not the ABC's intention.</PARA>
<PARA>The ABC has not confirmed any intention to make a correction on air about what it has broadcast. In the same item last night, Mr Nicholas Newland and I were reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schofield:"Science Minister, Peter Cook, pitched in to rebut suggestions that the problems were caused by underfunding."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cook: "This particular program has not been cut back, and so no-one can blame a lack of funding for this particular program as the reason for the escape."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schofield:"But it later emerged that even if the funding was sufficient, the research has been cut back and subjected to political pressure."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Newland: "The sort of thing that can happen is that, if . . . if governments are, for example, coming up to elections, then they may well be looking for some positive result.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All we've had is people say, `Well, do you really need to do this . . . this much research? Why can't you release it earlier?'"</PARA>
<PARA>This program has not been subject to funding cuts. I answered a detailed question on that in question time today from Senator Burns. It is funded by the Agricultural and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand, the Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, the Meat Research Corporation, the International Wool Secretariat, the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the Bureau of Resource Science. None of this funding has been reduced since the original budget was struck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out that Mr Nicholas Newland, quoted in the program, today reaffirmed that no political pressure had been applied to the RCD program. He said he told the ABC that suggestions that the program had been subjected to any political interference were unfounded and that a quote from him had subsequently been used out of context in the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News</EMPHASIS> story.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a sorry incident.

This suggests that a serious national story in which precision is necessary for factual and accurate reporting was deliberately and wilfully misrepresented.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) to a question without notice asked by Senator Patterson this day, relating to the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook said this in answer to a question I asked about the increasing gap between the rich and the poor:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can say categorically that the evidence is quite clear on this subject: the rich are not getting richer and the poor are not getting poorer in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on with some more gabble. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any allegation that the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer is not true.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know who to believe. I do not believe either the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) or Senator Cook. But the Prime Minister admitted earlier this month that the gap between the rich and the poor has widened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somebody has to be wrong. Senator Cook says that it has not become wider. He said categorically that the rich are not getting richer and the poor are not getting poorer. He also said that any allegation that the rich have become richer and the poor have become poorer is not true. His Prime Minister has told the Australian public that there has been an increased gap between the rich and the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not have to be very bright to realise that there is a huge discrepancy between what Senator Cook said here in the chamber today and what the Prime Minister has said. I do not know where Senator Cook has been. All you have to do is go out into the community to find that, after the recession we had to have, Australians do not feel any better off. There is a widening gap between the rich and the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 12 months, a report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics has found that 24 per cent of all families have no family member employed, that more than 700,000 children under 15 live in families where no-one has a job, and that one in 10 couple families with dependent children has both partners out of work. I know that was in November 1994, but it is very difficult to always have the most up-to-date statistics. Things have not changed that drastically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has estimated that the number of people living under the poverty line over the past 10 years of the Labor government has increased. We have had 13 years of people getting poorer. The Human Rights Commissioner has said similar things. ACOSS has warned about increasing levels of poverty. Professor Ann Harding, in her report, which she released yesterday, and Professor Helen Hughes say the same thing. Over the last 12 months, all these people have come out over and again providing evidence of the increasing gap between the rich and the poor. Senator Cook stood here today saying that there is not an increasing gap. That totally contradicts Prime Minister Keating, who says there is one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They do not go into the community&mdash;I suppose the Prime Minister spreads his time between his mansion in Woollahra and the Lodge&mdash;to see that people are finding it more and more difficult to pay their bills. I suppose that on the one hand the government is trying to say that there is not a problem. On the other hand, the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) yesterday had to give another $2.3 million to families in crisis. Why is that? Because the agencies&mdash;the Brotherhood of St Lawrence, the Salvation Army, the Smith Family and the Red Cross&mdash;are all telling us that there has been no reduction in the number of people who are struggling to make ends meet. They are getting as many calls and demands on their services as they were before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Christmas before the last election, what did the Prime Minister do? He said to the charities, `We will give you one dollar for every dollar that you raise. We will match one dollar for every dollar.' But when they went to sign the fine line, they found that it was every dollar that they had spent over the Christmas period. It meant millions of dollars less than what the charities thought they were going to get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government threw money before the people at the last election in a trick way. Again, Senator Crowley yesterday threw $2.3 million at people. That is what they are doing. It is another pre-election promise. The charities did not get any money before last Christmas. Last year, I asked whether the government were going to do anything before last Christmas. They did not do anything. Why are they doing it before Christmas this year? Because there is an election. That is what they are doing. This money was not available last year. About this time last year, I asked whether they would give money like they did before the 1990 election. Senator Crowley said no. Guess what? They have come up with $2.3 million this year. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Further to Senator Cook's answer today, it is crystal clear that what has been happening to the people of Australia by staff of Labor senators and members is a massive defrauding of the Australian public.

Senator Cook has two offices in Perth. People could not get through to them.

This is the interesting thing: I wonder whether Senator Cook eventually got through on a line into his electorate office that is actually there for the use of the candidate for Stirling. Senator Cook has a line set aside in his electorate office for the candidate for Stirling. That office line was actually being answered on a day when his electorate office phones were not.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have called the office of Senator Peter Cook. Due to industrial action we are unable to answer your call today. Lengthy and unreasonable delays in finalising the electorate staff salary restructure have forced this action.

<PARA>It is very enlightening to see the opposition taking the position that they have over this issue. I would like to read from yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the question of Senate Crane to Senator Cook. Senator Crane asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why was your office on strike yesterday, how long have they been on strike and when are they going back to work?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook, in answer, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My office was closed down yesterday, Senator Crane, because my staff, along with a lot of other workers in Western Australia, were rallying in support of industrial democracy and fair and proper industrial standards and expressing their solidarity and opposition to the Western Australian draconian industrial relations laws.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the fact of the matter. Senator Cook has never misrepresented or misled the Senate. But I would suggest, Senator Knowles, that you have. Regarding the staff pay claim, I am very interested in and very curious about what you people did. Did you round up all your staff in a little corner, threaten them and tell them that they were not allowed to participate in any industrial action to try to negotiate a wage increase?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What is more enlightening for the people of Australia is the fact that this highlights very clearly the opposition's position on industrial relations. If workers take one iota of industrial action to pursue their interests, to pursue their rights and the conditions that they believe they ought to be entitled to, the opposition will never support it. The opposition will seek to remove all forms of law that entitle employees to do that. That is what the Australian people have to be able to see. It is becoming very clear to them again. It was clear to them before. They thought they would give the opposition a second chance. However, unfortunately, as I said yesterday, the leopard never changes its spots. Certainly the opposition's spots have not changed. In fact, they have become further ingrained. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) to a question without notice asked by Senator McKiernan this day, relating to a universal visa system and comments made by the Chief Executive of the Tourism Council, Mr Bruce Baird.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bolkus took the opportunity in question time to use the most abusive language in respect of Mr Bruce Baird, who is the chairman of the peak tourism body in Australia&mdash;the Tourism Council of Australia. He used words such as `offensive', `irrational', `big-noting', and `misinformed', and even suggested that Mr Baird would be only too happy to let Al Capone come to Australia. This is typical of the abusive language used on a regular basis not only by Senator Bolkus but also by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He is obviously looking forward to being a clone of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before Bruce Baird became Chief Executive of the Tourism Council he was the motivator who gained the Olympic Games for Sydney in the year 2000. Mr Baird is reflecting the tourism industry's views which he so capably represents. It is typical of this government, this minister and other ministers like Minister Brereton and so on, when someone says something they do not like, to promptly come in and kneecap them or abuse them in a way that is absolutely disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me point out&mdash;and this is where the crunch comes&mdash;that I know Mr Baird had a radio interview and I know that in that radio interview he supported the joint communique put out at the Tokyo summit of the tourism industry. This summit was made up of 63 tourism leaders and was sponsored by the Australian Tourist Commission&mdash;not by Mr Bruce Baird's organisation, the Tourism Council of Australia. The statement was put out by the co-chairmen of the summit. Who were they? Mr Jon Hutchison, the Managing Director of the Australian Tourist Commission, a government body, and Mr Isao Matsuhashi, the President of the Japan Travel Bureau. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what this minister has come in and here and accused Mr Baird of doing was a communique and a press release put out by the Australian-Japan Tourism Summit. I might say that this summit was a major step forward. It was the first time that we have had industry leaders from both countries sitting down to reach an agreement in the marketplace on a strategy for the future. Let me also say basically what the covering note on the communiques said: in view of those discussions, which are in the interests of promoting tourism into Australia among a whole lot of other things&mdash;and I will mention some of those things&mdash;it included the abolition of visas for Japanese tourists and a relaxation of the conditions governing working visas for Japanese tour guides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among other items covered were: the improvement and development of tourism infrastructure, which everyone knows is desirable in this country, and marketing and distribution. It went into a whole range of things: about new products, a more coordinated destination promotion by the Australian Tourist Commission, product pricing, pricing at levels that are competitive&mdash;and this relates to airline fares, which are very important if we are to continue the tourism growth that is so important to this country&mdash;access to airline services, and visas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minister came in here and made atrocious allegations. He said directly that Mr Baird should apologise to people in the immigration department. He indicated that someone in one of the South-East Asian countries&mdash;I think he said Vietnam&mdash;died doing his job and that Mr Baird should apologise. What an outrageous remark on the part of a person on the Tourism Council of Australia. More importantly, he has branded Mr Baird, who is doing his job very effectively, for a statement put out by the summit and the co-chairmen of that summit, one chairman being the President of the Japan Travel Bureau and the other being Mr John Hutchison, the Managing Director of the Australian Tourist Commission, which is the government body that is responsible for promoting Australia overseas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year, the 31st since overseas leisure travel was liberalised in l964, the number of Japanese travelling abroad is showing a favourable increase, and is poised to exceed the corresponding number last year, despite continuing economic uncertainties and the damage inflicted by the Great Hanshin Earthquake. There is also a favourable increase in the number of Japanese travelling to Australia and Japan is expected to retain its status as Australia's No.1 tourism source into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia recognises the importance of Japan as its largest tourism source market, while Japan recognises that Australia, with more than 21 times its own surface area, has ample capacity to provide additional international tourism infrastructure in order to sustain healthy growth in the future. In this regard it was agreed that tourism industries in both countries should act in close collaboration with each other.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I reject the assertions that Senator Parer has made about the minister in his response to my question today. The thrust of my question related to what I heard this morning on the ABC radio <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program when I was in the process of getting dressed, which accounts for the shabbiness of my tie today, which is not up to the normal standards. Let us just get the matter into some perspective. This item&mdash;and it was a major item on the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program&mdash;was introduced as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia could be missing out on a hundred thousand Japanese tourists a year and up to a billion dollars because it insists that tourists obtain visas. The estimate of travellers turned away by the paperwork has come from the Japanese operators attending an industry summit in Tokyo.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on and then later introduced Mr Bruce Baird. I was very disappointed with Mr Baird's comments this morning. I heard that he did come to see me prior to his own industry conference in Australia last week or the week before. He also alerted me to the fact that this conference was taking place in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take exception to some of the words that Mr Baird used this morning. I will quote his words in the first instance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the Immigration Department, the mandarins in the Immigration Department, are all-powerful and their scenarios are unbelievable. They have people thinking, and there is a parliamentary committee that has been set up that makes their recommendation next month, or it's expected to, and they've got images of the Triads, all types of nefarious cooks, wheelers and dealers, drug barons emerging out of every country to come and descend on Australia. Now that is just clear nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly the words that he was expressing were nonsensical. I am appalled that a person in his senior executive position can utter on national radio words to that effect. He is implying that the parliamentary committee that is examining Australia's visa system was set up at the instigation of the immigration department. Let me tell you here and now that nothing could be further from the truth. If anybody wants to claim credit or point the finger of blame for that particular inquiry they can point it at me, the person who chairs that inquiry. I read the concerns of the tourism industry and thought that this was a worthwhile issue that a joint parliamentary committee, deputy chaired by Senator Short, the opposition immigration spokesman, could certainly look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major issues to come through in the inquiry is the protection of Australia through the use of the visa system to keep out organisations such as the Triads. But when we are looking at Japan, we are looking at a different type of organisation than the Triads. The committee is in the process of formulating its views on it. We have not done that as yet. We hope&mdash;and I ask Mr Baird for this&mdash;that when he returns from Japan with the evidence, he will give it to the committee. We in turn, on the basis of the hard cold evidence that he has been able to glean in his travels, might be able to incorporate that into our report and our recommendations, which we hope to give to the parliament some time next month. The people I have met recently in the embassies in Jakarta, Beijing, Shanghai, London and Bangkok who work for the immigration department are doing a phenomenal job and an enormous output of visas is being issued, which Australia as a nation is benefiting from. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the first annual report presented by Mr P.J. Barrett, the new Auditor-General. Can I say how pleased I am Mr Barrett chose in his first report to refer to his predecessor, Mr John Taylor, who retired as Auditor-General on 13 January 1995 and who was replaced by Mr Bill Nelson, who acted in the position until Mr Barrett commenced on 2 May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I think the whole parliament will be pleased to acknowledge that the new Auditor-General has spoken in a very warm way about Mr Taylor's period as Auditor-General. He states in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Taylor devoted himself to the duties of this Office with skill and energy. John was responsible for guiding the strategic direction of the ANAO during a period of considerable change and for raising the public profile of the Office in many forums. We wish him well in his retirement.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate has already expressed that view, but I would simply like to reinforce it. However, I do hope that there will be no diminution in the sorts of objectives that Mr Taylor had set for the audit office, in particular the hopes that many of us had about the extent of the reform that was to be undertaken following some years of obvious dispute between the audit office and this government relating to, if you like, the audit office's intrusive involvement in&mdash;some might call it quite proper examination of&mdash;various matters such as the sports rorts, whiteboard scandal when the Auditor-General examined complaints that I and some other senators, particularly Senator Campbell, had raised relating to this shonky deal that the then minister for sport was undertaking. Without the Auditor-General's strong support, I believe that matter would not have reached its proper conclusion as it did. The Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evolving reform environment over the last twelve years is now to be reflected in the bills which are to replace the current Audit Act, and the proposed replacement of the Public Service Act. When enacted, this legislation should provide a robust and flexible legislative framework for public management into the next millennium.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we must all recognise that that is not the ideal solution. There are still matters which the previous Auditor-General raised that have not been entirely and satisfactorily resolved. I hope there will still be pressure to ultimately make a better set of reforms. I commend the new Auditor-General for the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have decided as a policy position that the conduct of financial statement core activities will be undertaken by ANAO office, provided we have the necessary professional capability and demonstrated performance.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our recruitment and personal development policies are being progressively designed to ensure we do.</PARA>
<PARA>The ANAO also needs adequate resources. The government has an obligation to ensure that those resources are provided. The Auditor-General goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the hand, non-core financial statement audits will be undertaken utilising, if cost-effective and appropriate, private sector expertise.</PARA>
<PARA>I have discovered that some very substantial private sector accounts which come before the parliament have been dealt with through this exercise of getting private sector accountants to undertake audit office work. The Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point I would like to emphasise is that the ANAO's aim, by allocating its own resources mainly to the audits of core government, is to consolidate its expertise and experience in that particular area of public sector activity.</PARA>
<PARA>I am glad to see that the area of greatest controversy in which the ANAO has been involved&mdash;that is, performance auditing of government bodies&mdash;is one area of activity that it is going to retain. I commend the Auditor-General for a comment in the report which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO regards performance auditing as core business and, as such, these audits will be delivered primarily using ANAO staff. Importantly, however, this resource is, and will continue to be, supplemented on a needs basis by specialist external expertise.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the ANAO will cover as much of this area as possible because I think its objective examinations in the performance auditing area have been exemplary and I commend it for that. The Auditor-General says that there is considerable mutual interest in the outcomes of communication between the ANAO and agencies on performance audits. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Confidence needs to be promoted in those outcomes for all stakeholders including, importantly, the Parliament. Performance audits offer considerable scope for adding real value to public administration, and in 1994-95 reports tabled made recommendations estimated to realise one-time savings of $96 million (up from $73 million in 1993-94).</PARA>
<PARA>That is a one reason the audit office ought to receive adequate funding. There is a good financial reason for that, but there is a greater reason which involves the principle of accountability to the parliament. In my view, that is the major role of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General says in relation to that topic:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In dealings with the Parliament, as with public sector agencies, the ANAO has an obligation and indeed a responsibility to act in an apolitical, impartial and objective manner.</PARA>
<PARA>Under Mr Taylor it certainly did that. I hope it will continue to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a table on page 46 which makes interesting reading because it demonstrates just how these estimated potential savings from performance audits were arrived at. Interestingly, in the latest financial year the number of recommendations made in efficiency audit reports was only 251&mdash;less than half that of the previous year. The number of recommendations made in project performance and follow-up audits was only 82 as against 232 in the previous year. The number of recommendations made in performance reports accepted by the auditee towards estimated efficiency savings, accountability and effectiveness was 297 in 1994-95&mdash;less than half the 628 of the year before. And so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of audits tabled in addition to the ANAO tabling program was only 13 compared to 33 in the previous year and the number of reports tabled within budget in accordance with the ANAO tabling program was only 20 as against 33. However, the result of that apparently much reduced activity was a much greater potential saving arising from these performance audits from $73 million to $96.7 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I certainly commend the improved outcome in money terms, I think many of us in this parliament would not like to see a diminution of energy in the spread of examinations or in the number of recommendations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not speak at great length about this report at the moment. One of the great benefits of these annual reports coming in, as they do now, in their final form before Senate estimates committees meet is that we have the opportunity of discussing the reports in great detail at the estimates hearings. I am grateful for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a couple of problems with the report. In the past I think it has been normal for this report to outline the number of consultants it has used and to list who they are. Having flipped through this report, I do not see that information now but, hopefully, we can take up that matter at Senate estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of substance that I do want to raise is peripheral, I suppose, to the department but it has to do with page 133 of the financial statements. It reveals that there are guarantees and undertakings by the Commonwealth relating to various borrowers. One of them is Telstra Corporation Ltd. Under the Telecommunications Act 1991 there are 28 loans and the total principal amount covered by Commonwealth guarantee is $704 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What intrigues me is that Telstra recently wrote to the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee, expressing the view that it should not be required to come before Senate estimates committees for examination because it was not requiring an appropriation. But here we have the Commonwealth with a massive contingent liability. There is no guarantee to us as senators that that contingent liability will not be called upon in the current financial year. I hope it would not be but there is the potential for it to be called upon. There is a potential expenditure, a capacity for expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To me it is an absolute nonsense that any organisation like Telstra which has the support of such a guarantee should assert that it is not required to come before an estimates committee. In fact, we have decided to call Telstra before another committee of that same committee, and it will deal with the annual report. I suppose the only significant change that will take place is that instead of the minister or the minister's representative being there to, if you like, guide the senior management of Telstra at the estimates committee meeting, there will be no such minister. There will simply be the chairman and the committee, and the representatives of Telstra will be obliged&mdash;and I underline that for Telstra executives&mdash;to answer questions; they will be obliged to be responsible; they will be obliged to tell the truth to this committee without the sort of obfuscation we had at the last estimates hearings from some senior executives of Telstra. I found that to be totally unsatisfactory. I think Senator Calvert would endorse the view that some of the answers we got from Telstra at the last estimates committee hearings were far from satisfactory. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The commission's regulatory powers prior to the superannuation industry supervision legislation were largely limited to checking the compliance status of funds claiming taxation concessions. Since then, particularly with the passage of the SIS legislation, its role has increased exponentially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission nowadays places great importance on informing trustees about their prudential management responsibilities. It also checks that funds are well managed. It conducts a series of audits and reviews. If there are weaknesses in funds, the commission points them out and requires trustees to rectify them. On some occasions, the commission uses its stronger SIS powers to take action against particular funds and their auditors. However, I use this opportunity at the tabling of this document to raise several other related matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is the draft report involving the licensing review of investment advisory services. This draft report is said by the Financial Planning Association of Australia to be built on a framework to regulate the securities industry of the 1980s, where the giving of advice was embraced under the umbrella of a dealer's licence. `To deal' was defined as involving activities designed to induce persons to enter into security transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the industry has a far wider role: advice on superannuation, risk insurance, estate planning, savings strategies, retirement planning and social security, et cetera. However, a range of regulators cause problems covering the activities of financial planners: the ASC, ISC, RBA, AFIC, TPC and BBCA. Arising from the statutory requirements of these regulators, it is inevitable that there is a lot of duplication and costly compliance. There have been calls in recent times for the bringing together of the offices of the ASC and the ISC. While I believe that such a merger proposal may be somewhat premature, I call on both the ASC and the ISC to prioritise the need for common definitions and standards, uniform complaint handling, contractual restrictions and particularly the levels of disclosure to overcome all the different levels of compliance required by these five or six regulators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators may recall that historically the ASC and its predecessor were not all that successful in stopping the corporate cowboys literally ripping millions of dollars off shareholders during the 1980s. I do not entirely blame the regulator, because the courts and the wider community have to carry some of the blame. However, we must remember that this was in an environment where these sorts of corporate cowboys were regarded as national heroes. One regulator went so far as to say to me when I raised the question with him, `Not a jury today would convict such local money heroes.' It is a national disgrace that people such as Skase are still living a life of luxury overseas and defying Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was into this environment of the late 1980s that the ISC was born. Very quickly, it stopped several potential frauds, including that of Occidental Regal Life, where one of the perpetrators only a few weeks ago received something like a four-year gaol sentence. The commissioner at the time, Richard Beetham, has to take much of the credit for such intervention. Despite these successes and its huge workload, there is still a constant trickle of criticism about the cost of compliance from accountants, superannuation fund administrators and trustees, about the lateness of delivery of annual statutory forms and about a poor educational campaign, which has had some prominence recently, involving $3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With almost $200 billion under investment, naturally the ISC has a wide range of supervisory functions involving four general insurance pieces of legislation as well as regulating insurance intermediaries. For example, there are 988 general insurance brokers, 61 life insurance brokers and over 100,000 different sorts of superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take this opportunity to mention a couple of features that the government will have to address in relation to superannuation fairly quickly. They cover award superannuation contributions and the payment of what I term compulsory member contributions and the government matching contributions. Ideally, these should go into a single fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some problems with the self-employed. Currently, a section 82AAT notice from a member advises the amount of contributions for which a tax has been levied. This continues unchanged under the rules from 1 July 1997. However, an education campaign will be necessary to explain the new arrangements, as up to 25 per cent of a self-employed person's contributions can be nominated as a single non-deductible and eligible for matching government contribution subject to the income test. Later I would like the opportunity to raise other issues that have to be treated as a matter of some priority. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>On 17 October, a couple of days ago, I was interested to read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> an article by Andrew Darby in Hobart which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's biggest union yesterday joined the fight over the "battlers", warning the Keating government these voters would want new policies from Labor at the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Beazley, was told bluntly that many people were in pain in the present economic climate and Labor must come up with changes to address the demands of single-income families, in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He accepted what he described as a "barb" from Mr Jim Maher&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a very noted trade unionist&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">who is retiring after 25 years as president of the 235,000-member Shop Distributive and Allied Employees' Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Maher told the union's annual conference: "There are many people in Australia today who are suffering, and suffering hard. Families trying to bring up children, rear them and educate them in the current environment is not easy. They can truly be described as battlers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"I would . . . hope for the future that the government will, whatever other promises it makes, attempt to look after those genuine Australian families that are today struggling."</PARA>
<PARA>To my amazement, the response of Mr Beazley, the Deputy Prime Minister, to Mr Maher was that the government `would be standing first and foremost on its record' at the next election. Yesterday it was reported in the media that Mr Beazley would be releasing a detailed defence of that record, which would be a key element of the government's strategy for re-election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was that in particular which prompted me, on behalf of the coalition, to give notice of motion yesterday of the fact that the government did propose to run on its record at the next federal election; to condemn the government for that appalling record; and to welcome the opportunity to expose the government for this appalling record between now and the forthcoming federal election. That is what I and some of my colleagues wish to do in the course of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> No government in the living memory of this country, with the possible exception, of course, of the Whitlam government between 1972 and 1975&mdash;the last Labor government, but it was a relatively short lived government&mdash;has produced such an appalling record. Of course, in the case of the Hawke and Keating governments, that has been an appalling record that has extended over 13 long, hard and bitter years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The record which we are very happy to see the government fight the next election on is one of a litany of broken promises. It is a litany of record levels of debt in the Australian economy, of record levels of unemployment, interest rates, family breakdowns, bankruptcies&mdash;you name the problems you can think of in an economy and if you look at the record of this government over 13 long, hard years, it is impossible to surpass it. Just have a look, for example, at the question of foreign debt. The total debt that Australia owes to the rest of the world has risen from $23 billion net when this government came to office in 1983 to today's figure of $180 billion. That is $180,000 million. It is equivalent to $10,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. It is an eight-fold increase during the life of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, of course, a consequence of the huge current account deficits run by this government and it means that Australian families and businesses are paying higher interest rates than they otherwise ought. In fact, and I will come back to this later, they are paying amongst the highest interest rates in the world. I am sure that all Australians were absolutely flabbergasted to hear the Treasurer and other leading members of the government, including, although he did not know which way to go from one day to the other, the Prime Minister, assert that the current account problems that we have in Australia, which are the greatest of any western nation, are indeed not a contributing cause to Australia's very high interest rate regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will quote the views of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a very respected industry organisation, in its July 1995 newsletter. It puts the problem in a very clear perspective. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has a possible nightmare facing it in the not too distant future as a result of its balance of payments situation. The current account is a long-term problem which is undermining every aspect of Australia's economic life.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, I interpose, the social fabric of this country as well. The article goes on, rightly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is keeping interest rates high, which is slowing growth. It is preventing real incomes from rising. It is putting upward pressure on the consumer price index and creating additional pressure on non-productivity related wage increases. The prospect of further rises in interest rates is making the business community, especially small business, highly tentative about taking on additional investment projects.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to elaborate on the other problems that arise from all of that. Foreign debt is a huge problem. The current account deficit is indeed a huge problem. At almost six per cent of gross domestic product, the current account deficit has, for the third time under this Labor government, left Australia with banana republicesque external account imbalances. It puts us worst in the industrial world, worse even than Mexico that we used to laugh at. Mexico, in fact, is improving to such an extent that it probably will be in current account surplus next year. It reflects an inability of this government to get its economic policies in order after 12 years so that Australia can compete internationally and actually afford the consumption that we enjoy and want to continue to enjoy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current account deficit, our external accounts, is the achilles heel of our nation. The underlying problems that cause the lack of competitiveness have gone from bad to worse under this government. Indeed, it was this scenario of a high current account deficit leading to the crippling record interest rates in 1989-90 which sent Australia into the worst recession in 60 years&mdash;a recession which, of course, was, on his own admission, deliberately engineered by the now Prime Minister and then Treasurer, Paul Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That recession tore apart the fibre of Australian society. It produced one million people unemployed. When the knives were out for former Prime Minister Hawke by putative Prime Minister Keating, I remember you, Mr Acting Deputy President, in your capacity as a senator from Western Australia, saying that there were 999,000 reasons&mdash;it subsequently went over one million&mdash;why Paul Keating should never be Prime Minister of this country. Whilst I disagree with you on occasions on matters of policy, Mr Acting Deputy President, on that one you were absolutely spot on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we have a major unemployment problem in Australia as well as a major employment problem. We hear much about the government having created all these hundreds of thousands of jobs in the last two or three years. What we do not hear from the government is the comparison of employment now compared with what it was five years ago. Full-time employment in Australia peaked at 6.3 million people in jobs in July 1990&mdash;just five years ago. Five years later, after the recession that Prime Minister Keating said that we had to have&mdash;and after his much vaunted 16 quarters of growth&mdash;total full-time employment today stands at 6.2 million. In other words, Australia today has almost 100,000 fewer people in full-time employment than we did before the recession. That is in the context of a labour force which is another 500,000 larger due to population growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the legacy of Labor. That is the record on which the Labor Party proposes to stand at the next election. It is a record of record unemployment. It is a record of record bankruptcies. It is a record of record family breakdowns. It is a record of record homelessness in our society. It is a record of record foreign debt. It is a record of broken promises that no-one could have imagined any leader of any nation&mdash;particularly this great nation of Australia&mdash;would deliver during his period in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most striking broken promise, of course, was the one on which he arguably won the last election&mdash;the l-a-w law tax cuts. In that case he promised Australians $8 billion of tax cuts if they re-elected the government. Within one week of taking office he admitted that he and then Treasurer Dawkins were working out how to get out of the second tranche&mdash;the larger tranche consisting of two-thirds of the tax cuts&mdash;on which they had won the election. Not only did they break their promise, which was a legislated promise, but they also went through a whole raft of tax increases that they had promised they would not make. Those taxes were in the areas of cars, general sales tax, wines, petrol and the like. We have had a record of record broken promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a great and growing divide between the rich and the poor in our country. We now have a situation where many Australians are saying, `This was the land of the fair go. It no longer is the land of the fair go because of what this government had done for us.' Under this government we now have a record of greater inequality with an entrenched underclass locked out of opportunities. We have amongst the highest income taxes in the world. From this government we presently have amongst the highest real interest rates in the industrial world. As of today we have amongst the highest inflation rates in the industrialised world. We have this great tragedy of being amongst the highest youth suicides in the world. That is a figure that ought to stun every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a record of manipulation of political appointments and government appointments that is beyond belief. I must say that the return of the Australian Ambassador to the United States to head the Prime Minister's attempt to survive at the next election and all the events surrounding that, in my view, produce the ultimate cynicism that people face about these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are matters of great concern. We have a government which has lowered the standards of propriety and honesty in government to the lowest level that, I think, any of us can ever remember. We have a government which willingly, as I said, lied and deceived its way back into office with a subsequent record of broken promises that has never been contemplated before in this country. We have a government that promised $14 billion of tax cuts at the last election only to deliver $18 billion of tax rises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there were a good prospect of economic recovery in the period ahead, one might view these matters in a different light, although the government stands on those records anyway. We on this side of the chamber welcome the opportunity to fight the next election on the government's own record because it is a record that stands in the starkest possible way and will be condemned by each and every Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have got no chance because even the most informed commentators have signalled to the government that that gap in the polls now is unbreachable. But the government has put in place certain stages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first stage of its campaign to attempt to rein back that gap in the polls was a campaign to discredit John Howard and to produce fear. Well, that failed. We know that failed in the Queensland election quite smartly where Wayne Goss and his cohorts put out the well-known faux postcards which stated that the coalition in Queensland was going to privatise the four hospitals. That completely failed, and we now know that fear campaigns do not work in the federal sphere either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government is into stage two now&mdash;to run on its record. That is doomed to failure. What stage three will be is anyone's guess&mdash;probably to throw itself at the mercy of the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was thumbing through <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shaping the Nation&mdash;Achievements of the Labor Party</EMPHASIS>, wanting to be fair to the government. I thought that after 13 years of government I was sure to find one or two good achievements to give the government credit where credit is due. No government could possibly be in power for 13 years and not have achieved some good. So I looked at the health and community services section and I saw the heading, `Breast Cancer'. I thought, `Yes, there has been greater awareness in the area of breast cancer, and even perhaps some more expenditure.' Then I remembered that it was Senator Jocelyn Newman who first brought the issue into this chamber and forced the government into making changes. So that cannot be put down as a government initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I looked at the environment section and saw the heading `Whaling'. I thought, `Whaling is a very honourable cause.' Then I remembered that the policy the government is carrying out is no more than a continuation of the Fraser government's enforcement of the banning of whaling and drift-netting. So that is not an achievement at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this bulky blue document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shaping the Nation</EMPHASIS> I could hardly find one credible achievement in the government's 13 years. But, to give credit where credit is due, there was one achievement, and that was in the veterans' affairs area&mdash;the Australia Remembers campaign. We all know that was well done. Congratulations to the minister. But that is about it. Every other area is a statement of failed administration and, worse than failed administration, lost opportunities. When we look back over the 13 years of this government we see that it will be declared a government of lost opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even as recently as last night the government was making changes to what it considers to be its most shining initiative, Working Nation. Up until two days ago Working Nation was a document dead in the water. The latest unemployment figures showed that Working Nation was not working. Long-term unemployment had jumped by some 6,000. The trend for unemployment was back up again and all the initiatives were failing. That hurriedly cobbled together cabinet meeting last night was to resuscitate and attempt new initiatives for Working Nation, like the employee subsidy scheme. From the start the government was told that this was full of complexities and difficulties and would never be taken up by the employers, and that is exactly what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation in its very first instance was never seriously going to address the unemployment problem. Deep within that document is the evidence. One of the major tenets of Working Nation is that the very best this government could do was to reduce unemployment to the figure of five per cent by the year 2000. That is some 750,000 to 800,000 Australians, which is absolutely no improvement on the unemployment figure as it stands today&mdash;763,000. That statement alone in Working Nation enshrines the hopelessness that so many unemployed Australians feel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that admission is not bad enough, within Working Nation the statement had a qualifier. To reach that figure of some five per cent unemployment by the year 2000, we needed a growth rate of between 4.5 per cent and five per cent for every year to the year 2000. What is the growth rate at the moment that the government is so proud of? The growth rate has slowed down to 3.5 per cent and we cannot expect any better in 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been equally stunning failures&mdash;just like Working Nation, all wrapped up in glossy pages&mdash;such as Creative Nation. One year on from all the fanfare of Creative Nation, what do we have? Buried within Creative Nation under the additional outlays summary table the government committed itself to some $62 million for the 1994-95 financial year. This was broken up into $45 million for the Australian Multi-media Enterprise and some $17 million for a range of other initiatives. The Multi-media Enterprise initiative has not received a cent in the last 12 months. The other initiatives, totalling some $17 million, have received only $10 million. So that was hollow rhetoric from the very beginning. Creative Nation is now starting to fall over, just like Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the Better Cities program. That has all the hallmarks of sports rorts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Forshaw will be on the front bench in government long before many of those opposite will be. Let us compare the education retention rates between the coalition when it was in power and the Labor government. Education is vitally important because it does not just teach people how to read and write. Education prepares people for life. The more education you can have the better prepared you are. When the coalition left power in 1983, the retention rate for year 12 was 36.3 per cent. In 1995, we now see the retention rate at 74.6 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some of the conservative held states like Victoria, the retention rate is actually dropping. People are being forced out of school; they are being disencouraged to stay at school and encouraged to leave school. That is a really sad reflection upon the needs of this community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983, the school participation rate per 1,000 persons aged 15 to 19 was 383&mdash;it is now 491. In higher education, there were 250,000 full-time equivalent places&mdash;there are now 411,000. The participation rate per 1,000 persons aged 17 to 64 was 36&mdash;it is now 51. This means that more people are availing themselves of the opportunity for re-education, for continuing education. These are the sorts of policies that this government has implemented to assist people to get an education and to stay on to get further qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also been working very hard at meshing in the education system, of interlinking so that people can start their education in TAFE and work through and have recognition of that prior learning and those qualifications for their university courses and the like. This is vitally important, because many people who may leave school early, who may drop out, discover later in life that they would like to do some study. They feel that going to university is perhaps beyond them at this stage and they do not have the confidence. By doing some accredited TAFE courses they find that, yes, they can study and they are not `dummies' as they have been told they were for dropping out of school early. They can study and they are motivated to get good results. They are able then to use their TAFE courses to go on to university to do diplomas and degrees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These improvements to the education system are a vital improvement to the welfare of this country. Whatever we do to this country, we have to ensure that we have an educated community and that people are not just told, `You have not got a job. You are no good, you will not get a job, you do not need any training.' That is what is happening in other countries and, as we come out of this recession, that is what makes us different from other Western developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the US you have a very major underclass of poor. There are no programs, no incentives in that country operating to assist those people who have lost jobs, who might never have had a job, to get some skills, to get some education, to get some self-respect and self-esteem and therefore re-enter the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reading some of Robert Reicht's work, you find that in some other countries people are given financial assistance but they are still not given the training, the jobs and the skills. That is what is so different about Australia. What is so caring about this country is that we are providing these people with financial support, but we are also providing them with skills, with qualifications that they can actually use when they enter the marketplace&mdash;and that is vitally important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I keep saying, this government does care. We do not have policies from the opposition. How can people make a decision about who should govern this country if only one side is working or has policies and there is an opposition with no policies and obviously no ideas? All they can do is sit and carp and be critical and repetitive. This is a very stark contrast that is available to people in the community to look at. We are a government that is actually working and caring; we have an opposition that will not show us their policies.

<PARA>We know that this government will say and do anything to stay in office. We know that there is simply no end to the waste of taxpayers' money and the amount of taxpayers' money that this government is prepared to spend to keep itself in office. We know that this is a government which is obsessed with wasting taxpayers' money in order to look after its special interest groups. This was highlighted today by a question from Senator Hill. We find that this government is funding the student union at Melbourne University to the tune of $1.2 million. We find that that money is going towards funding a book or a periodical that is instructing people on how to shoplift. I think that is an absolutely disgraceful waste of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, I found through my waste watch committee that another group called SIC was using government funds to promote male prostitution as a way of working your way through university, and that was highlighted. I must say that at least in that case, when it was highlighted by myself, the minister at the time, Mr Howe, had the decency to cut off their funding. In this particular case, the university has been threatened with loss of funding. But what has happened to the student union? Here they go again running this article on how to shoplift. I think that is another example of how this government allows its special interest groups to waste money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a government that cannot control its wasteful spending. It is a government that is now trying to hide its wasteful spending, just like it is hiding the true youth unemployment figures. For instance, in the way it has changed its Senate estimates committees in terms of what is now open to scrutiny, the government is trying to hide where it is wasting money. Similarly, the way it presents its annual reports is another way of hiding where the waste is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, it was pointed out that with the arts grants it is very difficult to find out where the money is going&mdash;more waste. We had it highlighted in the House of Representatives. At least Ros Kelly had the right idea: she used to put her grants down on a whiteboard. She could wipe them off afterwards, so there was no trace of where her money went. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chief amongst those people hiding the money is the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself. When you try to find out the true facts, what happens? Recently the Prime Minister hosted a party for 100 Labor Party members and hangers-on up at the Lodge. He has refused to answer my questions on how much it cost. I know it cost $7,000 just to hire the crockery and a few chairs, so goodness knows how much they spent on the food and drink they had up there. But no, the Prime Minister has refused to answer those questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same situation arose when I put questions on notice, because I was concerned&mdash;as all my colleagues would be and members of the government should be&mdash;about the amount of money that seems to be spent on computer hardware and software. We are forever having our computers changed and our programs changed, and I thought it would be a good idea to find out from the government departments just how much taxpayers' money is going on computer software and hardware. One department had the decency to answer very quickly&mdash;it was the environment department, one of the smaller departments in the government&mdash;and they admitted to spending $43 million on new hardware and software over the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened to the rest of the departments? The Prime Minister said, `No, it is too hard to find out.' If these computers are as good as people reckon they are, I would have thought you would only have to press a button to find out how much money the government spent on computer hardware and software for the year. But the Prime Minister refused to let that button be pressed and I could not find out&mdash;nor can the taxpayers of Australia know&mdash;just how much money has been spent by this government on all this new equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is no doubt that this government believes it is beyond judgment and beyond accountability. It is an arrogant government. I think that was shown pretty well today when Senator Schacht, in answer to a question, said that the $1.2 million being spent on a magazine that has not only disgusting language all through it but also an article on shoplifting was inconsequential. That is the typical arrogance that we get from this government. They are so blatant about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has taken jobs for the boys to a new art form. You have got mates like Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and John Spark who have received over $800,000 from the government to act as consultants in the sale of ANL. What a waste of money that was! Former Queensland ALP backbencher Brian Courtice, who by coincidence just happens to have been endorsed for the next federal election, is going to receive over $300,000 in publicly funded consultancies by February 1996. What about our former mate in here, Senator Loosley, who left this place only a short time ago? He does not appear to have taken too long to get his nose into the old Labor Party trough. He is now swanning around the United Nations receiving hundreds of dollars a day to sing the praises of Gareth Evans&mdash;no doubt so that Gareth will have somewhere to go when this government is thrown out of office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year the government is going to waste over $1.5 million of taxpayers' money on the National Media Liaison Service, the propaganda arm of this government. We also know that $14.5 million has recently been spent on promoting the government's superannuation ideas. Just to give another example: why did the government have to spend $1 million promoting the $20 note? For goodness sake, you have to spend $1 million promoting a $20 note when we all have to use it. I suppose you will spend another $1 million promoting the $50 note. If there is any money left in the bin, you will probably spend another $1 million promoting the $100 note&mdash;if you ever get around to making it into plastic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyway, we estimate that, by the time we reach the next election, this government will have spent $50 million of taxpayers' money on promoting itself. Today we hear about them running on their record. The Attorney-General's Department spent over $3 million in developing a law enforcement access network called LEAN. This was intended to be a massive computer link-up of people's various records so that the department would have a very nice record of everybody. The Privacy Commissioner and I raised doubts about whether this would work but, no, the department would not take any notice of us. However, eventually, the department scrapped the whole idea, and therefore wasted $3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could go on forever talking about the waste of money with this particular government. It is not only the big ticket items but also the small ticket items that we should be concerned about.

That is what we get from Senator Calvert.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this government has a proud record. This spurious motion moved by Senator Short says that the government proposes to run on its record. Yes, we will run on our record and we will win on our record, because it is a great record. No amount of running around the countryside by the opposition sanctimoniously pontificating about things like computers will divert the Australian people from examining our record and from comparing it not only with your atrocious record when you were last in government but also with your complete absence of policies about the future of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the record. Let us first deal with the economy and the period we have enjoyed of unparalleled economic growth&mdash;16 consecutive quarters of economic growth. We have an economy today which is internationalised, not like the economy we were left with in 1983 with a huge budget deficit, an economy that had gone to sleep for the 30 years that the government was controlled by the coalition forces. In this time exports in this country nearly doubled as a share of GDP. We have put manufacturing industry on its feet and we have provided the incentives and the investment climate for manufacturing industry and manufacturing exports in this country to grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We no longer rely or seek to rely on digging our exports out of the ground or taking them off the back of the sheep and shipping them off overseas as they did back in the McEwen days, as Senator West pointed out. We have restructured this nation's economy. We took on the hard tasks, the tasks that your predecessors&mdash;the government that Mr John Howard was the Treasurer of&mdash;shirked from ever tackling; that is, doing something about putting this economy and this nation into the rest of the world so that we can compete with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that restructuring as it has taken place in this country and throughout the world has been at times a painful and a difficult process. That is understood. But it has also been a necessary process. What we have been able to do is bring those changes about in industry at the same time as maintaining a social justice system which protects ordinary Australians. If we are to be criticised for taking those tough decisions then that is a criticism we will happily take on the chin because the Australian people will recognise that we have had the courage to tackle those issues. Those issues include how we coped with the massive rate of technological change and its impact upon industry; and how we tackled bringing about economic and industrial reforms while our commodity prices were collapsing on international markets, while we had one of the most sustained periods of drought in this country and while we had to compete with the protectionist policies of the European Community and the US. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are very difficult economic times throughout the world yet we in this government have managed to improve the economic position of this country so that we are expanding our trade in Asia and expanding our manufacturing exports. We have one of the best economic records of any country in the OECD. We have one of the lowest inflation rates, yet we also have the economic growth rate being sustained. We have been able to do that and achieve, at the same time&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, in a drought period where so much of our economy is always dependent on our commodity exports. We were able to do that and have stable interest rates at the same time. So because of our government's policies we are doing far better than are most other countries in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move to the long list of items which typify the great record of this government and which we could go on about if we had a lot longer. Let us look at superannuation. As Senator Sherry has pointed out, one of the greatest advances in this country is the introduction of superannuation. Now we have over 90 per cent of Australian workers enjoying superannuation. It is an initiative that was opposed all the way by the opposition and by their supporters in the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out before, whenever we took that issue to the Industrial Relations Commission most of the employers supported your party and were opposing superannuation. Yet superannuation fund assets today are approaching $200 billion. They are already greater than the foreign debt level and they will double within the next five years. So we are building the massive savings and investment base that this country will need into the future and, at the same time, provide the retirement incomes policy that we desperately need to deal with an ageing population. This is an issue on which your party has an absolutely atrocious record. You never did a thing about superannuation in all the years you were in office. It was a privilege to be handed out to the wealthy and the few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reformed taxation by reducing income tax levels to a point where we now have the second lowest tax levels in the OECD. We have lower corporate tax rates. We have rid the country of the only industry that was going forward when you were last in government, which is the tax evasion industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Working Nation and those great labour market programs, 670,000 jobs have been created since April 1993. We are on track to reduce the unemployment rate, as indicated in the Working Nation program. But what do we get from you? We get whingeing, carping and complaints about these programs, but we do not get any indication of what you would do. You have no policies on how to deal with this important issue concerning the future of young people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator West mentioned education and training. This government is proud of its record in education and training. We now spend $5 billion per year on higher education, and $768 million on direct vocational education and training. Our retention rate has increased.

There are two aspects in this debate that I would particularly like to address: record job losses; and the creation of an unprecedented number of new battlers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Forshaw added to the very cogent government argument by trying to tell us that all of the government's economic policies present a very attractive proposition to the 700,000 unemployed who are still trying to find a job in Australia today. He also clouded the issue by talking about superannuation, which I cannot really see being a topic for debate. It is obvious that he had to resort to talking about total irrelevancies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government, since 1983, real average weekly earnings have fallen by 0.4 per cent. Under the Labor government, a single income family is $27 per week worse off today in real terms, even taking into account transfer payments. In March 1983, average monthly home loan repayments were around 19 per cent of the median monthly family income. Figures up to May this year suggest that the proportion is now 27 per cent. I presume that the government will not dispute the findings of the Gregory-Hunter study recently announced, which found that, since the mid-1970s, the average real household income of the poorest five per cent of suburbs dropped 23 per cent while the richest five per cent increased their incomes by 23 per cent. The income gap has widened 92 per cent, or $20,000, in 1995 dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to a recent study, Australia's record of inequality has been worse than that of most other countries in the OECD.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. An international study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation ranked Australia fourth behind Norway, New Zealand and Britain in the growth of inequality in the 13 years from 1979 to 1992. All of this is very damning evidence, but there can be no more damning evidence provided than growth in the unemployment figures. Almost every week figures come out which show that the drop in unemployment is not that which is portrayed by the government and that there is an enormous amount of hidden unemployment, of underemployed people who would like more work and of people who have given up trying to look for work because they know that the jobs are not available. Not only that, the government claims that over 500,000 new jobs have been created since the last election. The actual number of available jobs is only 236,000, a factor which reflects the destruction of employment during the depths of the recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people, once they undertake more than one hour of study or training per week, go off the unemployment figures.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now well into the fourth year of the economic recovery and unemployment remains at a higher level than what it was at the last point in the last recovery.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very brief time available I would also mention the very damaging social effects of unemployment. It creates further pressure for those people whom we have described as an unprecedented number of new battlers. These people, because of the neighbourhoods they live in, which have been totally neglected by the Labor government, have very little hope of getting a job. That often plays an increasing role in family breakdown and family violence. Unemployment destroys individual wellbeing and self-esteem. Unless it is urgently addressed, we will see an intransigent underclass of exactly the same type mentioned by Dr Russell, which he maintains exists in America and which the coalition maintains is starting to exist in Australia today.

Part of that is acknowledging where achievements have been made and what areas still need to be addressed. The SDAEA have contributed to this agenda and obviously seek to continue to contribute to this agenda. They have worked for improvements for low income families. They have achieved improvements in family assistance, which is part of this government's record. They have achieved the introduction of the parenting allowance, the impact of which we have yet to see in inequality statistics. They lobbied for and, with the government, improved the situation of many pensioners in Australia by bringing about indexation, a policy which had not been supported in the past by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Ann Harding's research report was referred to in question time today by Senator Patterson. This report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">What is happening to income inequality in Australia?</EMPHASIS>, was released last night and provides examples of how the government's agenda for improving the lot of battling Australian families is ongoing. Professor Harding points out that income distribution is a subject in which there is keen interest in Australia, and thank God for that. This is probably why the international trend of a growing gap between rich and poor is diminished in Australia. Unlike other countries with policies that the coalition seeks to mirror, the trend here is diminished. Yes, there is a growing gap. Senator Cook did not deny that earlier today. He did point out, however, that the poor are not getting poorer. The social security safety net, established and improved by this government, has been substantially improved. But the problem is ensuring a fair distribution of Australia's growth, and this is an ongoing issue. This is the issue on which the government can stand on its record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As pointed out by Professor Harding, a boost in business income has been a major factor in growing income discrepancies. A growth in the wages and salaries of senior executives has also assisted in the growing gap between rich and poor. The government acknowledges these problems as factors to be accounted for in its continuing ongoing social reform agenda&mdash;an agenda which the coalition lacks. The government's record is in continuing improvements in government cash transfers and social wage benefits. As acknowledged by Professor Harding, social wage services are a very significant component, especially for families with children and elderly persons. `Social wage benefits should not be ignored in the income distribution debate,' Professor Harding says. When government cash transfers are taken into account, the earnings of the top 20 per cent of income earning families drop significantly from 13 times to five times that of the lowest 20 per cent. But this is not good enough, and the government acknowledges that. Our cash benefit transfers make a significant difference, but so too does the social wage overall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is not good enough is that the gap between rich and poor is growing. This is why, as cited in Professor Ann Harding's report last night, the government has commissioned a study of trends in income distribution, including non-cash benefits, to be completed soon. Contrary to Senator Troeth's comments, I refer to the final page of Professor Harding's report where she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the moment there is no data available to tell us whether the distribution of final income has become more or less unequal since 1980.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no data, but this government is looking for such data so that it can continue its agenda of reform. The outcome of this study commissioned by the government will contribute to the government's ongoing agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let me conclude on the coalition's record&mdash;or should I say `What record?' It is not only that there is no policy in many areas, but there is also no consistent policy. Will we remove the unemployment benefit after nine months, or won't we? Will we introduce a $3 wage for youth, or won't we? Will we cut expenditure or will we preserve the same social safety net? In this context let me conclude by referring to the recent comments by Mrs Bronwyn Bishop and let the Australian public judge. Answering questions last Friday about the changes a Howard government would make to child support, Mrs Bishop said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is an important principle that when you bring children into the world you have to remain responsible for them, and it is not the taxpayers' responsibility to pick up the remnants of a family when it breaks up.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the taxpayers' responsibility? We need policies from the coalition in terms of what those opposite think is the taxpayers' responsibility. The Australian public needs to know what sort of policies the opposition has. At least the government can stand on a record of a social reform agenda. </PARA>

You should explain to them the things you are supposed to have done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I want to address the underemployed today in the limited time I have got left. The underemployed are defined by the Bureau of Statistics as those part-time employed persons who prefer to work more hours than they are working, plus full-time employed persons who work less than 35 hours in that survey week. That is what they are looking at. I said before that this government rates anyone who works an hour a week as underemployed. They are the ones who are looking for work of some sort and are already working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To test their true figures, let us step back to 1985. This government always tells us what the Fraser government left it in 1983 but never mentions that 1983 had the worst drought on record. It was recorded in June 1985 that there were 607,600 people unemployed, or 8.4 per cent of the labour force. But it was also recorded in 1985 that there were 225,000 underemployed, or 3.1 per cent of the labour force. This meant that 11.5 per cent of the total work force were either unemployed or underemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comparable figures for June this year, exactly 10 years later, show that the Bureau of Statistics found 724,800 unemployed, a rise of 117,200 on the number of unemployed at the end of those 10 years. This represents 8.1 per cent of the work force, or a fall of only 0.03 per cent on the 1985 figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now for the underemployed. While all that had happened, the number of underemployed skyrocketed to 597,000, an increase of 200 per cent over the 1985 figure. That is why I want this government to run on its record, especially its record of unemployment and underemployment. There has been a 200 per cent increase from 1985 to 1995&mdash;all under the Labor government&mdash;with an additional 372,000 forced by Keating-created economic circumstances to accept less than they are prepared to work for. A combined total last June of 14.7 per cent of Australia's labour force&mdash;and the latest figures show that that has crept to over 15 per cent&mdash;was bearing the brunt of the Keating taxation reforms, or Keating's economic failure, which I am happy for it to run on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter how the government interprets these figures&mdash;we hear every day in question time what it has done since 1983&mdash;or what the government may claim to have done alongside this or anything else; the bottom line is that since 1985 the Keating government has allowed an extra 489,200 workers to fall behind either as unemployed or underemployed. Half a million people have been affected by Mr Keating's policies in those days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear day in day out how this government has improved employment in Australia, but they never mention&mdash;you never hear the word&mdash;the underemployed. In every month's statistics on employment, unemployment and underemployment they are always there, but Senator Cook never mentions it in answers to questions. It is time the government addressed that. Of course, it is far too late. The election has to be held by roughly March next year and nothing this government can do will do anything, unfortunately, for the underemployed. I am very happy, and I am sure my colleagues are very happy, to run on the government's record.

It is interesting to note that the deficit in 1994-95 will be about $26 billion, which is $16 billion up on last year. The OECD expects Australia to have the highest current account deficit as a percentage of GDP in the developed world in 1995 and 1996. Australia's deficit is expected to be about 5.7 per cent of GDP. That is worse than the US at 2.4 per cent, the UK at 1.1 per cent and Canada at 3.3 percent and close to the banana republic levels of the mid-1980s.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no coincidence that our bank prime rates are the highest in world and no coincidence that Australia has the worst current account deficit in the industrialised world. The high interest rates reflect a number of factors, including the reliance of the government on monetary policy to manage the economy and large budget deficits. Higher interest rates are demanded by lenders because of the uncertainties caused by the current account deficit, mounting foreign debt and the lack of confidence in the government's capacity to keep inflation low. The prime rate in Australia is 11.5 per cent, in Germany it is 7.5 per cent, in Japan it is three per cent and in the United States it is nine per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join in this debate this afternoon to refer to one aspect of the motion before the Senate and that is to talk about record job losses during the period of this government's self-induced recession in the early 1990s, and relate that to the actual impact that it has on a family where the breadwinner loses his job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could talk about many things under the terms of this motion, but all of it really comes back to people and the impact on their lives and on their children. I am sure many of us have received letters from constituents in recent times. I certainly know that my colleagues have. Perhaps Labor members have not. Perhaps constituents have given up trying to impress them with what has occurred and feel that it just is not worth the stamp anymore because they are so out of touch with what is happening in the world that there is little point in trying to relate to them anymore. But I wish to refer to one letter that I have received in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thinking about the sorts of things you hear on the news, men who are apparently intelligent leaders of our community, ministers of this government, talk about economic issues with such jargon. For example, `The economy is on track'&mdash;whatever that might mean. `It seems that we've got the settings about right'&mdash;whatever that might mean. And, of course, the other quite incredible statement about `never having had it so good'. I actually cringe when I see this happening on television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Men with that ability, who are supposed to be ministers running this country, dare insult the people of this country by using that sort of meaningless jargon, instead of explaining what is going on and giving some explanation for their conduct. But, no, month after month as the figures come out we get fed this rubbish language that means nothing, that is supposed to seduce people into believing that what is said is true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This letter that I referred to starts off by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Reid,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My letter addresses the worsening financial status of the pensioners, the unemployed and the low-income earners. As an example of my own situation, I have been unemployed for the past four years with a wife and three young boys who are remarkably bright for their age. They see their father at home every morning when they head off to school and they see him sitting at home when they arrive back after a day at school where they are quick to realise that there is not much use in getting involved too deeply in their school-work when there is going to be no work for them when they leave school.</PARA>
<PARA>What hope has this man got of inspiring his three bright sons to do well at school and have careers, and giving them an aim to do something with their lives? He wants to. He is in his mid-forties and has been out of work for four years. He is trying to maintain a home and family in an environment where he can give his boys some values and some aims for their lives. Yet he is left in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has been on every training course you could think of and a whole lot more of them. He has done every computer course that goes. He does not mind doing that. If there was a job at the end of it he would be delighted, but so far nothing has happened. He feels as though he has been put on the scrap heap. Taken away from him has been the right to bring up his boys to have a career, to have a life and to have some self-respect. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We attempted to sell our home, pay off the mortgage and move elsewhere, where the children could grow up away from the city and it's associated problems. I guess it is no surprise to you that our property didn't even attract an offer during it's four years on the local market where it dropped some 20% in value over that period.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to outline other issues and matters and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find it very difficult to swallow the fact that multi-million businesses are booming while my wife, my children and I are literally scratching around for food, and wearing clothes from St Vinnies and the Salvation Army. Thank God for these establishments. . . </PARA>
<PARA>In the next paragraph of the letter he concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Reid, we have just spent a cold winter and it was not pleasant.</PARA>
<PARA>What I want to do today is to say to government ministers, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in particular: can't you hear what these people are saying; can't you comprehend the despair of a man who had worked all his life up until his early forties, when he was thrown out of work through no fault of his own, that he is not able to bring up his family and provide for them as he wants to? He is living on welfare and his wife is going out on such days of the week as she is able to do domestic work for others in an attempt to keep the family together. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I heard Mr Keating on an ABC programme of some months back now, explaining that the ongoing recession is necessary to basically bring down our standard of living to enable us to compete with our Asian trade partners. My kids do not give a damn about Asia or it's largely Third World style of life I can assure you and your adversary Mr Keating. Our children are our future. I cannot feed them on rice every night. I cannot feed them on Republican talk.</PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To strengthen my opinion, the word `recession' is rarely heard now, although most indicators show we are simply becoming worse off.</PARA>
<PARA>The PS to the letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware that welfare is increased supposedly in keeping with CPI figures but this system has fallen victim to long term erosion of the dollar's value.</PARA>
<PARA>He wrote to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and has put together the figures which indicate that the actual costs of running his family and his household are very much out of kilter and that the CPI adjustments do not keep up. He had a letter back from the Minister for Social Security indicating that these figures are checked out about every 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good that they are checked out, but it is not much consolation to my constituent who mainly has to sit at home. He does not have the money to go out and do the sorts of things that people would regard as normal for a man with three young sons. He is despairing of ever getting a job again, having been on welfare for four years and having been on every training course that has been presented to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate we should remember the many families in this country that are in this situation.

<PARA>I think it is quite clear from the announcement about the recall of the Ambassador to the United States of America, Dr Russell, that the government clearly intends not to run on its record. We hoped that it would, but clearly the recall of Dr Russell, who has been recalled because the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has run out of both political guidance and policy advice and support, tells the Australian people&mdash;particularly Labor backbenchers and, I presume, Labor frontbenchers and the press in this place and around Australia&mdash;that Mr Keating is really in trouble because the government, if it ever had any policy focus in this term of government, certainly has lost it and is desperately groping around to find it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this appointment of Dr Russell as Mr Keating's adviser in the policy area comes only a short two or three weeks after the so-called glimmer twins, Mr Smith and Mr Swan, are reported in the media to have led a push against the so-called innovation statement by Senator Cook, which in itself is a bit of an oxymoron. They described that statement, we are told, as a bronze medal strategy, as a pathetic policy document. That is what they are reported as calling it. Mr Keating has taken over that policy development, and not even he is able to come up with an innovation statement, or the housing policy we have been promised, or the youth policy he promised&mdash;now something like six or seven weeks ago. He said that we would have a new youth statement from this Labor government within a month. Of course, the deadline for that passed a couple of weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this government is in policy fatigue. The reality is that it is looking more and more likely every day that Mr Keating will not be running to the people of Australia at the next election on his record. What an abysmal record to run on. He is going to, of course, come up with a series of policy announcements. I think the interesting thing about that is that, as you move around Australia, you notice that the people have stuck up their shutters when it comes to policy announcements and statements from this government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Prime Minister goes on national television and says, `We've got this great low inflation', what is the record of inflation right now, right here in Australia compared to our trading partners in the OECD?

That is what the small businesses of Australia have to pay if they want to borrow some money and create some jobs for young Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to support the motion moved by Senator Short. The people of Australia ought be made aware that, of the 13 speakers that have participated in this debate, only three have presented on behalf of the Labor Party to try to defend their record. The Labor Party wheeled out a troika of triers who completely failed and, after their failure of a contribution, fled the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a host of issues this country needs to address&mdash;first of all, the overwhelming debt this country faces, the unemployment problem and the current account deficit. The list goes on and on and it is that record that we on this side of the chamber will be presenting to the Australian people. That is why we are so delighted that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has indicated that the government proposes to run on its record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the question of debt, one of the Labor contributions, if I can use that term&mdash;I would be using it quite loosely&mdash;tried to make fun of the Liberal Party's debt truck, which is travelling around this country promoting our concern about the huge international debt that this country has. Somehow, it was made a matter of some jest by the Labor contribution in that this was in fact a light commercial vehicle that was manufactured overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get to the point. The debt truck is a two-tonne Ford trader four-cylinder diesel assembled in Australia and, like commercial vehicles in that range, it is no longer manufactured in Australia. Why? Because after 13 years of Labor the economy is that shot that that type of vehicle can no longer be produced in Australia. The fact that the debt truck is made out of imported parts highlights to the people of Australia the very real difficulties that our economy is in. If the Labor Party see that as a joke, it is a joke on them because it reflects on them. It indicates how terrible a state our economy is in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have a huge debt. We on this side of the house will continue to alert the people of Australia to the danger of that. In fact, some years ago Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, was concerned about our high debt and he was also concerned about the current account deficit. What did Mr Keating recommend? Allow me to quote the following passage:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were told that people recognised that they had to suffer for the nation's good. Treasurer Keating told us on countless occasions throughout the 1980s how interest rates must be kept high. `We must dampen down demand, mate,' he said, `otherwise the imports will be sucked in and the balance of payments affected.'</PARA>
<PARA>From whom do I quote? None other than the former Labor Premier of Victoria, John Cain, in his book. I ask the people of Australia rhetorically: what has happened since that high interest policy, the recession we had to have and all those other things? Imports are still being sucked in and the balance of payments is being affected adversely. In fact, we are having month after month of record current account deficits. All the pain that was inflicted by the Labor government has brought not a single skerrick of gain. That is the Labor Party's record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go to the question of unemployment, as a result of this recession we had to have the government has created a large class of permanently unemployed people. The government, because of its absolute ideological commitment to supporting the moribund trade union movement in this country, has introduced legislation such as the unfair dismissal laws which, of course, applies to parliamentarians. Who is the first person to fall foul of the unfair dismissal laws? None other than the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Sciacca. Whilst the Labor Party will preach to the people of Australia that they are genuinely concerned that there be no unfair dismissal, who is the first parliamentarian to fall foul of it? A Labor minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government says that they are concerned about child poverty. What did former Prime Minister Hawke say? He made a promise&mdash;remember?&mdash;that no child will live in poverty by a certain year. We have passed that year and the number of children living in poverty has, unfortunately, increased. That is another proud record of the Australian Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In recent times members of the Labor Party, because they cannot defend themselves, seek to draw on Mr Howard's previous ministerial experience. If the Labor Party wants to play that game, we will embrace them. Firstly, because Mr Howard has an excellent record as a minister and Treasurer of this nation and, secondly, if that is the basis for judging Mr Howard's performance, we will take Mr Keating back to when he was a minister in the Whitlam regime. That was the first time he was a minister. We will judge Mr Keating on the performance of the Whitlam era, with the highest inflation rate this country has seen, burgeoning unemployment and minister after minister being sacked. Remember Cairns and all the others who got sacked?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember the scandal of the Khemlani loans&mdash;a government absolutely rocked. Of course Mr Keating found himself sacked by the Governor-General, as he should have been sacked. That is not the first time the Prime Minister found himself sacked. There was somebody by the name of Mr John McGuinness, who worked for David Jones at the time, who had the good foresight on 15 July 1967 to sack Mr Keating. He provided a number of reasons. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was a very arrogant person and often rude to customers. We had complaints about him all the time. I really don't think he's the man to run the country.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr McGuinness is an ordinary fellow who used to work at David Jones, but he made a very appropriate decision in 1967. Sir John Kerr made an appropriate decision on 11 November 1975 to sack Mr Keating, again as a minister. I trust that the people of Australia will make it a trifecta for Mr Keating by ensuring that he is sacked as the Prime Minister of this country at the next election. I look forward to a new era in Australia when John Howard and Peter Costello hold the purse strings and Australia can look to growth in employment, a sustainable and stable economy, when the people of Australia will be able to have a future to be proud of. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>I would like to first of all thank the secretariat for the very considerable work it did in the preparation of this report. I took over as the chair of this committee when the reference was already before the committee and a considerable amount of evidence had already been taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the very nature of the inquiry, the inquiry was an extraordinarily broad one. There was a massive amount of material presented to the committee, and the secretariat really did a magnificent job in pulling that together, particularly Geoff Dawson, who worked tirelessly on the preparation of several drafts. Robert King, the secretary of the committee, and Frances Michaelis also worked extremely well with this committee through many, many months&mdash;in fact, several years&mdash;of the taking of evidence and preparation of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out to the Senate that the committee was indeed very broad, being one into arts education. It involved a consideration of education in all art forms, although most of our witnesses took this to mean the five art forms listed in the national curriculum&mdash;that is, dance, drama, media, music and the visual arts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee faced several general difficulties in the interpretation of the evidence and in the making of conclusions and recommendations. The first difficulty was that many of the submissions carried complaints about the status or resourcing of arts education. This was clearly of great concern to very many people. However, we were aware as a committee that if our inquiry had been into science or maths education we would have been presented with submissions making similar claims for these disciplines. We have therefore avoided making recommendations which may have been modified had we had the benefit of evidence from these other sources. We felt we would be unjustified in drawing rigid comparisons between the support for arts education and these other disciplines, without taking evidence in these other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, when the submissions were divided between different art forms, the number in each did not provide the committee with enough material to go into detail about each one. We have therefore not sought to make recommendations which relate to the relative merits of music and dance or drama. Furthermore, most of the submissions are dealing with the art and not nearly as many gave contributions towards the educational aspects. The committee's secretariat was required therefore to augment the evidence presented by witnesses in the area of education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, much of the funding and administration of education comes under the jurisdiction of the states. As a Senate committee, we were aware that we had even less force of persuasion with the states than we do have with the Commonwealth. Having said that, the Commonwealth has had a major part in the development of the national curriculum, the introduction of the key competencies and university reform following the introduction of a unified national system of universities in 1988. The committee believes the Commonwealth should play a major role in further improving the quality and direction of education, including arts education, in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, many of the detrimental features of arts funding and priority infected other areas of education. In my view&mdash;I am expressing a personal view&mdash;a solution to this deeper issue is fundamental to a solution to the problems facing the arts. Hence, most of what I felt about this was relevant to education in the more general sense, not just to arts education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Artistic expression is to be found throughout human history and in all people. As a former research scientist with a strong background in the biological sciences, this causes me to believe that artistic expression must have had considerable survival value. The earliest records of human civilisation show highly developed art forms. All extant indigenous people spend a great deal of time and effort in expressing and celebrating cultural identity through art. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without speculating on what that survival value may be, in attempting the even more difficult and speculative task of relating it to survival in the modern industrial world, I believe that six million years of human evolution would have built the need for and the satisfaction to be derived from artistic expression into our genes. It is against this philosophical background that I view with alarm the growing dominance of what has come to be called economic rationalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arts expression and arts education, like almost every other element of our lives, has become subservient to some degree to this paradigm. Art has become a market commodity; arts education is valued as a training for employment. Art, like science, has been corrupted to serve the needs of the industrial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the submissions raised, as a positive, the value of the arts in dollar terms. This may have been because these witnesses felt obliged to use the language of economic rationalism. This saddened me because in many cases one felt that this was not the way the witnesses would prefer to argue their case. Perhaps it is more because giving into this view of the world and using its language serves to reinforce its hegemony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that the statistics on the economic value of the arts are quite rubbery. The fact that the ABS does not keep better statistics is itself a reflection of the value which economists place on artistic endeavour. For example, $13 billion was mentioned by several witnesses as the ABS value of the `cultural industries'. Yet when this figure is analysed further it is seen that this represents about 1.9 per cent of GDP and that, within this figure, about one-third is media advertising, publishing, architectural services and radio and television services&mdash;they made up the bulk. Most of the submissions in our inquiry indicated that only about $1 billion relates to the arts as visual arts. Dollar values are a totally inadequate surrogate for aesthetic value as broadly defined. The rejection of the application of the economic rationalist paradigm to the artistic aspect of our individual and social lives is a message which I hope will come out strongly&mdash;and I believe has come out strongly&mdash;in our report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arts are about the fulfilment of some of our deepest and most atavistic needs. The attempt to reduce artistic endeavour to dollars and cents diminishes the very thing that is being measured. Thus, I believe that we need to reassert the value of a broad liberal education most strongly. We must reject the pressure to redefine education as vocational training lest, as a society, we become merely a human ant colony, each with specified and prearranged tasks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Humans are more than the flesh and blood cogs of an industrial machine and education is more than the process that takes the raw human material and fashions these flesh and blood cogs. This is not to deny that there is an economic and industrial component to artistic activity, but it is to say that these elements should arise as secondary to the creative and re-creative purpose. I do not draw a distinction between creativity and science and the arts, for the former is also suffering under the assault of economic rationalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The New Industrial State </EMPHASIS>in 1967 Galbraith saw very clearly where we were headed&mdash;I have used this quotation in connection with the Hilmer report&mdash;when he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we continue to believe that the goals of the industrial system&mdash;the expansion of output, the companion increase in consumption, technological advance, the public images that sustain it&mdash;are co-ordinate with life, then all our lives will be in the service of these goals. What is consistent with these ends we shall have, or be allowed, all else will be off limits.</PARA>
<PARA>The point that I wish to stress out of this report is that we need from this the evidence that was collected and from our analysis of that evidence to take a broader review in relation to education generally, of which arts education just happens to be a part. We came up with a number of quite specific recommendations. I will not deal with those here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply conclude by saying that the national curriculum needs to be reviewed in the light of a different role for education. It must clearly state that the role of education is not the vehicle by which human raw material is fashioned to the needs of industry. This must be seen as a secondary and relatively minor object of education. The achievement of a broad, general and liberal education must not become marginalised. Commonwealth special purpose funding should be conditional on this. The education minister should initiate a project of comparable status to the key competencies to clarify the broad purposes of school education and reassert their primary importance alongside employment related purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application of the key competencies, as currently listed, seems to have damaged the arts relative to other disciplines. It may be that a competency relating to aesthetic awareness needs to be added to the list. However, it may be that the very idea of measured competence in aesthetic awareness does irreparable damage to the very concept of aesthetic awareness. I think I will leave it there and leave it to other members of the committee to make their comments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee, the process of writing this report has allowed me to see many things, which I hope members of the public will now be able to see. It brings out a number of aspects of the nation's artistic life, which I think are important and which should be seen to be important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easily dismissed that a child's first creative expression comes when they go to a pre-school and they are asked to paint something&mdash;for example, do some finger painting&mdash;or make something. That is one of their earliest forms of personal expression. They are the very first things they do to define themselves. Yet too often that form of expression is dismissed and people see it as a time-wasting or childminding exercise. These are the sorts of things that this report goes to. For the first time on the public record it brings them to the wider society's attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also I think that the report quite rightly propounds the need for everyone to see that they have a right to express themselves and, indeed, an ability to express themselves artistically, even though they may not themselves feel that they are gifted or, in the general run of society, they may be seen as people who are artistically gifted. One of the aspects of this report which come out very strongly is that everyone has that right and everyone should be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You could go further and say that if we want a society which is intelligent, can cope with change and can be at the forefront of an economic world, we need a society which is flexible and able to take on new ideas and think in new ways. That is very much the essence of an artistic education. That is the sort of thing that this report identifies and, hopefully, will flow through to government decisions and attitudes about educators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also accepts that there are some in society who are genuinely artistically gifted. These people have a particular facility, be it in the visual arts or the performing arts. The report identifies the need for those people to have rigorous training of the very highest standard. That has not been lost in the balance between the right of everyone to express themselves and the ability of the few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report also identifies and continues the idea first put in Creative Nation, the government's report on the arts, which is that new technology needs to be harnessed by artists. It has to be the case that people in the artistic community are not left behind with the march of technology and the introduction of new media but are able to harness it themselves, make it their own and go into further areas of creative production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to speak for too long tonight because I am conscious of the time pressures on the Senate. I would like to say something particularly about the role of the chairman in this report. It seems incredible that this report has come out after the very early days we spent in a dingy room in state Parliament House in Adelaide on a very cold and wintry day, where we started with the first draft. It is a credit to everyone who had an input into the report that it is now a very different document from the document which appeared in that first draft. Nevertheless, the main ideas that were there are still in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At one point, I have to be honest with the Senate and say that Senator Carr and I thought we may have to bring out a minority report because the differences between us and other members of the committee were so great. But it is a tribute to the chairman's patience and his willingness to see the other side that that eventually was not the case and we were not required to do that. Our ideas were able to be incorporated within the body of the report and yet not threaten the intellectual rigour and structure of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tribute to the chairman that, when it came down to writing the chairman's report, he asked us whether we wanted to submit some ideas to him. The committee members were unanimous in saying that we were more than happy for him to go away and write his own report as he saw it. We felt that he had earned that right, given the work he had put into the committee. I seek leave to continue my remarks later because I am conscious of the time pressures on the Senate. </PARA>

I regret that it will be the last report in which he will be involved in presenting to this chamber in view of his decision, on health grounds, to retire very shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter can look back on this report with pride as he leaves the Senate. It very much represents the sort of man he is: a gentle man with a concern for the human condition. The report certainly has his stamp on it, and not only in the chairman's introduction. As Senator Wheelwright said, we were of the unanimous view that there should be a chairman's forward to encapsulate the spirit of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have particularly enjoyed my association with Senator Coulter in this report. Next to him, I attended the most meetings at which witnesses came before the committee. I suppose that, next to him, I was the senator most involved with this report. I am very pleased with the nature of the report. Obviously, everything is not exactly put as I would say it. Nonetheless, the general thrust of it is outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report deals with many difficult problems in arts education that I hope will be taken up in the arts community and will be dealt with by the government. They are far more difficult problems than many people have been prepared to recognise. However, the very large volume of submissions to the committee indicates that there is a level of concern in society about this matter. I also mention that many of these submissions appeared to be in total conflict with each other, which did not help us very much in establishing what would be a reasonable conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator John Coulter's chairmanship of this committee brought with it many problems. The composition of the committee changed overwhelmingly during the time he was trying to steer a rational, coherent course in this inquiry. To that extent, I welcome the fact that there is no minority report. There is an agreed report, even though there were some very strong differences of view, particularly between two late coming members of the committee. They did not have the benefit&mdash;if it was a benefit&mdash;of listening to so much evidence. Nonetheless, they agreed that there was a reasonable position that they could accept with a few amendments. However, none of those amendments have detracted in any way from the general thrust of what Senator Coulter was about, and I commend him for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a couple of points about matters that really concern me and which must be resolved. The question of devolution in education where local people are becoming more and more empowered, if you like, to establish what should happen in their schools within the state systems brings with it a huge risk. That huge risk, which is particularly evident in the area of the arts, is that local people may well&mdash;and they may well not&mdash;take a very materialist view, in that they want to see their school providing what they see as essential training in order for the pupils of those schools to get a job. In other words, the recession and economic hard times invariably put pressure on the school system to prepare people for a tough economic environment rather than to prepare people to be rounded and be able to cope with a total society, a society which is based not simply on materialism but on much more important things. The human condition depends immensely on its fulfilment of its artistic ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within everyone, as is pointed out in this report, there is a desire to express oneself, to develop skills and to have an appreciation of the arts&mdash;regardless of whether you are going to be a great performer, a potential audience or involved just at a humble level. The point is made in the report that there is even an artistic element involved in making your garden attractive. I would simply hope that devolution of power in terms of what can be done and what will be done at local school levels does not lead to a view that the arts are unnecessary, that the arts are peripheral and that the arts are not something that is central to the education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that extent, I have a conflict of principle. I oppose authoritarian centralism dictating to people what they should do. On the other hand, I do not want devolved arrangements leading to a diminution in arts education. This is a conflict which has to be resolved. I hope this report will bring some sensible discussion of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about what happened under the Dawkins' education arrangements where there have been some enforced linkings of bodies: for example, the Conservatorium of Music in Sydney and the University of Sydney, where there appear to be levels of incompatibility at this stage which have caused problems. I know that in many areas of Australia there are very happy unions between specifically arts oriented bodies&mdash;I mean art skills in that practical sense&mdash;and the academic approach of universities. The Elder Conservatorium in Adelaide is linked with the University of Adelaide, which is an academic institution. The Melbourne Conservatorium has always been linked with Melbourne University. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is this serious problem that the one-on-one or the one-on-two educational systems involved in a skill training&mdash;for example, in music&mdash;are not amenable to the normal academic pursuit where you might have 100 students in one class. When I was at Sydney University there were a couple of hundred people in an English class. When you are fighting for funds within an academic atmosphere, it is very difficult for a skill oriented operation like teaching someone the flute to be seen as a reasonable use of resources, when it is a one-on-one or a one-on-two arrangement as it is, when, for example, you have one teacher to a couple of hundred students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been disputes and difficulties in terms of allocation of resources in this situation. One of the recommendations is that the basis on which funds are allocated within the academic arrangements should be seriously looked at to avoid these conflicts which we hope can be resolved. That is the issue. That is the message in this report. Any conflicts that emerge and that tend to diminish the merit and significance of arts education should be resolved and there should be serious attempts by government to assist in the resolution of those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend Senator John Coulter for this report. I commend his enthusiasm in pursuing the subject. I hope I will get another opportunity to wish him well in his retirement. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very grateful to the Privileges Committee for this report. I know it is a report that members of the committee have agonised over for a long time because they have taken so long to come to a conclusion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some years ago some of the issues that are still the subject of debate in this report were raised with me by members of the credit union, Mr Lindeberg and Mr O'Neill. I am very sad to see the actions of certain members of this credit union. My support in this place for credit unions has been demonstrated and can be evidenced from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the whole credit union movement. I support it because of its mutuality principle which, to me, is a very important principle. I opposed the move to treat credit unions harshly, at least from my point of view, in terms of the tax treatment of them by the government a couple of years ago. In the superannuation committee, I supported very strongly the move to have credit unions supply superannuation savings accounts as part of the various products which might be offered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is distressing for me to read in this report of the Privileges Committee the activities of one credit union, the Queensland Professional Credit Union. Although the Standing Committee of Privileges did not determine to make a finding of contempt against the credit union, the committee was certainly critical of some of its activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to underline a couple of the things the committee said. In talking about the claim by Mr Kevin Childs of the credit union that a motion concerning the withdrawal of Mr and Mrs Lindeberg's membership and the refusal of Mr O'Neill's membership could not be discussed at a particular meeting, the committee said that it did not know how Mr Childs could have come to this view:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This, in the Committee's view, was either a misunderstanding or a misuse of a principle which may have application in other circumstances. Although the Committee had advised all persons involved in the matter that submissions made to the Committee were not to be released without the Committee's permission, this in no way precluded the subject-matter being canvassed in another forum.</PARA>
<PARA>The only conclusion I can draw is that the administration of the credit union went out of its way to prevent issues being raised which were of significant importance to members of that credit union and used all kinds of disingenuous argument to prevent those matters being raised. I note further that the committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not accept the reasons put forward by Mr Lee as Chairman of the QPCU for the withdrawal of Mr Lindeberg's membership. It considers the explanation provided by the QPCU disingenuous and draws attention to the comments made in Mr Lindeberg's submissions to this Committee in respect of them. The Committee has little doubt that such a withdrawal was, as Mr Lindeberg asserts, a reprisal for Mr Lindeberg's attempts to have matters of concern to him aired, notably at the annual general meeting of the QPCU on 28 October 1993. The QPCU's refusal of membership to Mr O'Neill was, in the Committee's view, to ensure that another person with detailed knowledge of the Queensland Professional Officers' Association Superannuation Fund and a supporter of Mr Lindeberg's efforts to call the credit union directors and management to account at that meeting would be prevented from attending and participating in the annual general meeting.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a serious matter. I believe that the Privileges Committee has done a service, albeit a very painful one, in drawing to the attention of the Senate and the Australian public at large the need for people who are the holders of office of public institutions, such as credit unions, to act ethically and morally and to be above any suggestion that they have acted in a way detrimental to the members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the committee for its work. I hope that this report will be widely read and become, in a sense, a warning to other people to act with probity and ethically in all matters such as this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to this report. I would like to begin by saying that, in my dissenting report, the Australian Democrats would draw attention to the fact that we support the vast majority of the very important recommendations that the committee made in this report. I would like to underline that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a couple of areas, however, that I was concerned about, and I would like to concentrate my remarks on those matters today. The most serious of these is the whole area of the age pension because, from the more than 250 submissions received by the inquiry, it was obvious that the areas of greatest concern to farming families were the assets test on Austudy, which was dealt with in the committee's report earlier this year, and the assets test effects on the pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that the inequity the committee found in the Austudy assets test also exists in the assets test that applies to farmers wishing to retire on their farms or to hand on their farms to the next generation. To get the full age pension, a single person can have assets up to $118,000, while a couple can have assets up to $167,500. The pension phases out for asset levels above these thresholds until it cuts out completely when the asset level reaches $225,000 for singles and $347,000 for couples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put this in perspective for farming families, we need to realise that figures from the farm surveys report 1995 showed the average value of various types of farms in 1993-94 ranged between $900,000 and $1 million. Quite clearly the owner of the average Australian farm is completely excluded from social security payments by the assets test. People might say that anyone with asset levels that high should not expect to receive any social security payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say this, however, would be to overlook the realities of farming: that is, that farming these days is a very capital intensive business and, further, that in Australia there is a great tradition of family farming whereby the monetary value of the farm is irrelevant because it is only a tool that is destined to be handed down from generation to generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the pension assets test impacts far harder on farmers was clearly shown by the figures that the department presented to the committee. Those figures showed that, whilst only 2.5 per cent of non-farm owning pensioners had their rate of pension determined by the assets test, the pension of 23.75 per cent of farm owning pensioners is decided by the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, while farm owners comprise just 0.65 per cent of those pensioners whose rate of pension is determined by the income test, they constitute around 7.5 per cent of those pensioners whose rate of payment is determined by the assets test. The other way in which pension rates affect farmers is through the operation of what are known as the gifting provisions. Without going into great detail on this, the practical effect of those provisions is that a farmer who retires and passes ownership of a farm on to a son or daughter is precluded from the age pension for five years, regardless of any subsequent lack of income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department's view, which was expressed a number of times at the inquiry, is that people should be required to sell assets before public support is provided. A number of submissions to the inquiry spoke of this view and of the way the pension rules have affected farmers. For example, a farmer from Western Australia wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I own a 193 acre property which has been operated by the same family since 1897. Social Security suggested I should sell off the farm for income. This was out of the question&mdash;being my only asset, and my home since 1950.</PARA>
<PARA>The Victorian Farmers Federation submitted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farm business assets are not readily realisable. Even if it is possible to find a buyer with depressed farm product prices (and with drought in some areas), it is impractical and self-defeating for a farmer to sell off a portion of his land in order to provide income support. Reducing the size of the operational unit reduces the farm's productivity and profitability.</PARA>
<PARA>Many submissions talked of families living in hardship or poverty as a result of two or three generations of that family living on the farm, the income from which is simply not sufficient to support the entire family. The Anglican Parish of Junee talked of cases from around their diocese where the social security rules were causing considerable stress and other health related problems, not just for those wanting to retire but for those wanting to take over the full running of the family farm&mdash;that is, the next generation. The Churches of Christ in South Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tying of age pension to the assets test causes unnecessary hardship, particularly on younger couples as parents do not have the income to survive off the farm. Often the spouse of the younger family has to find work away from the farm to support her/his family as whatever income the farm gains can only maintain the parents. This situation is not just, and also impacts on family situations in other ways. It can be resolved by change of the five year waiting time before pension is available after disposing of assets.</PARA>
<PARA>The Rural Counsellors of South Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the current circumstances so many farmers are living off their assets while two generations live on the farm in poverty. The older generation not able to retire because they have no income, and the younger generation knowing that the only way the farm can be theirs one day is for them to stay and work on it. Meanwhile the productivity of the farm is going backwards in so many cases, as there is insufficient income to make improvements or even maintain the assets.</PARA>
<PARA>And so we could go on. I could quote the recommendation of the Catholic Social Justice Commission, and what the Rural Counsellors of South Australia said. They all had the same story to tell. The Rural Counsellors quoted the words of the AAT in the case of Davey and Secretary to the Department of Social Security. Talking about the intergenerational transfer of farms the AAT said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We think that these means of passing on farm properties from one generation to another should not be discouraged. We would regard it generally as unreasonable that viable farm properties that are required for the support of one generation should be broken up by sale simply because of the older generation's need for support. It is of no overall benefit to Australia to discourage the concern which families have in maintaining and working farm properties and in passing those properties from generation to generation.</PARA>
<PARA>And so on and so on. In order to try to break the nexus which we have been faced with, I have proposed a private senator's bill which builds on many of the recommendations of those who submitted to this inquiry and who are included in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of my bill is twofold. Firstly, the bill will exempt the value of the family farm assets, including farm land, plant, articles and livestock, from the age pension assets test. This simply recognises that the inequity faced by students from farming families under the Austudy assets test is felt equally by those farmers wishing to retire from farming but remaining on their properties. In relation to this proposal, the Democrats note the evidence provided by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in which it is estimated that, if farm assets were exempted from the age pension assets test, at most 577 single broadacre farmers and 4,146 couples may become eligible for the age pension. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this evening's adjournment debate I wish to make some statements in relation to comments made last evening by Senator Michael Baume. Senator Baume made a range of wild comments in the Senate last night regarding the Australian Workers Union and, more specifically, its Victorian branch. Regrettably, some of his claims appear to be factual, but many of them create a misleading impression about the current administration of the AWU's Victorian branch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From mid-1989 to early 1992 the secretary of the AWU's Victorian branch was a Mr Bob Smith. This person no longer has any connection with the union, and he has not since 1992. His successor, Victorian secretary Mr Bruce Wilson, similarly ceased to be connected with the union in about August this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some aspects of Mr Smith's and Mr Wilson's administration of their AWU responsibilities appear to have been, at the very least, questionable. The receipt of moneys from some companies and the use to which those moneys may have been put certainly have a cloud hanging over them. However, it must be emphasised that the administration of the Victorian branch of the Australian Workers Union today is entirely different from that which ruled from 1989 until February this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the current secretary of the Victorian branch is also named Bob Smith&mdash;Robert Frederick Smith. He is a different person from the former AWU secretary, also named Bob Smith. The current Bob Smith was elected as Victorian secretary of the former Federated Ironworkers Association in 1990. Through the amalgamation of various unions which took place in 1991, 1992 and 1993 and subsequent internal restructuring, the Victorian branch of the Federated Ironworkers Association has since February this year been the core of what now constitutes the Victorian branch of the AWU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current Mr Smith and his team of officials, drawn from the old Federated Ironworkers Association, the old Australasian Society of Engineers, and responsible members of the old AWU are in fact the officials who first discovered and then drew attention to the apparent financial maladministration of their predecessors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfair in the extreme that the current Victorian branch of the AWU and its office-bearers should be associated in any way with the apparent maladministration of people who no longer have any connection whatsoever with the union. I am advised that the current Victorian branch is more than happy to assist any government authorities in seeking that justice be done and that the current interests of AWU members are well and truly safeguarded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federated Ironworkers Association and the other unions which today constitute the AWU all have their own honourable traditions dating back to the past century. I have no doubt that those traditions will successfully assert themselves within the new amalgamated organisation. In the meantime, members of the Senate should be assured that the sources of apparent wrongdoing within the Victorian branch of the AWU have been eradicated. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plight of the families involved with the timber industry in Tasmania is the matter that I wish to address tonight. I indicate as an aside that as I was preparing this speech I noted that `Australian News' was carrying a story which read in part as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leaders of New South Wales communities reliant on the timber industry fear job losses, major social and economic dislocation, and even the death of their towns will flow from the federal government's forest protection and industry strategy policy.</PARA>
<PARA>The sad consequences of the federal government's policy vacuum in this area are reflected in the plea by these leaders of regional New South Wales. My home state of Tasmania has similar fears. If I can quickly recount history, Mr President, you will recall that earlier this year the federal government was in a great state of turmoil in trying to determine what its forest policy ought be. After disaster after disaster, those involved in the industry engaged in a blockade around this Parliament House. During that period, on 27 January this year, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised assistance to those businesses disadvantaged by the government's on again, off again forest policy. Major losses were suffered needlessly because of the government's reliance on shonky Green studies which declared replanted airfields of some 20 years as old growth forests. Labor has a lot to answer for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor promised through its Prime Minister to compensate those businesses which suffered because of their harebrained approach to forestry. Australians ought be very angry that this policy debacle is yet another impost on Australia's ever growing debt. Those involved in the industry ought be, and are, angrier. Given the promise of compensation, requests were made ever since January 1995 on numerous occasions to Prime Minister and Cabinet and to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy as to what guidelines ought be used or were in place under which compensation could be sought. These family businesses were told to start preparing their submissions, accountants were engaged and verification undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, without any guidelines, those claims were submitted in July of this year. Seventeen days ago, on 2 October, the Labor member for Franklin (Mr Quick) released the federal government's Interim Hardship Business Eligibility Criteria Guidelines&mdash;just the name puts you off&mdash;with a great fanfare under the heading `Fair go for forest operators'. Nevertheless, despite all the jargon, the claimants persisted. They were required to resubmit their claims, and they did so with great haste because they were still waiting for compensation for money losses incurred earlier this year. But on the very next day the assistant secretary of the forest branch of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy put out an amended Interim Hardship Business Eligibility Criteria and Guidelines. Within a day the government was already changing its position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be no end to this government's indecision and incompetence in this area of forestry, which is so vitally important to my home state and to so many regional areas of Australia. One of the important changes made was to limit the claims to a maximum of $30,000. In my home state of Tasmania a total of claims has been made for $542,000. Out of the nine claims that have been lodged, only three fall under the $30,000 threshold. One is in excess of $188,000. Allow me to read from the letter that I was sent by these contractors, a family business. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need the compensation for the following reasons. We lost income, yet we still kept our workmen on and paid them full wages during the period of the shutdown.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that sort of a policy of industrial relations ought be supported by this government. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This depleted our cash reserves. As a result, we were unable to meet our debts as they fell due and consequently we are paying higher bank interest than we would be if we had not been shut down. In the near future we will have to find our workers holiday pay and our own taxation payments, which will further worsen our debt position due to our cash flow problems. Our financial situation will not return to our pre-moratorium position unless we receive full compensation for the loss we suffered. Our claim amounts to $188,288. Limiting a claim to $30,000 will enable the smaller claims to be paid in full, but will leave those who have suffered the most with the hardship that continues to grow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister stated that full compensation would be made available to those affected by the moratorium.</PARA>
<PARA>Undoubtedly, much to the embarrassment of the member for Franklin, this letter is from a contractor who lives and operates his business and employs people in the electorate of Franklin, in my home state of Tasmania. It was the federal member for Franklin who announced with all the fanfare that compensation would be paid and set out the guidelines. The fanfare was: fair go for forest operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Quick was undoubtedly of the view, `You beauty! I've been able to make representations and be successful for these forest workers and their families'&mdash;only to find that the very next day he was overridden in a completely roughshod manner by the assistant secretary for forests in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Undoubtedly it indicates the esteem in which the Labor government holds the federal member for Franklin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also indicates how out of touch the federal government is with the plight of this industry. Indeed, in my home state of Tasmania, out of the nine claims there is one for $3,000, which will be fully paid&mdash;as will the $6,000 claim, the $15,000 claim and the $1,400 claim. But there is a claim for $188,000, two for $90,000, one for $94,000 and one for $55,000. Some of these people drew on their overdraft facilities to keep families and breadwinners in money on the promise that the federal government would compensate them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 27 January the Prime Minister made that promise when he was getting into deeper and deeper trouble with the forest strategy. I say as an aside that the Prime Minister will need more than Dr Don Russell to try to fix some of these problems. Indeed, it is an absolute disgrace that the Prime Minister, after having made such disastrous policy decisions in relation to the forest industry, promises compensation and then reneges on those promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have acted in good faith, kept employees on and kept families from incurring hardship. In fact, they have saved the Commonwealth the payment of unemployment benefits for these people. Then what do we have? The government overriding the guidelines that were set out and then putting a ceiling of $30,000. It is indicative of a tired government that has lost direction. I can assure the forest workers of this country, especially of my home state of Tasmania and the electors of Franklin, that under a Liberal government they would get a much better deal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak in the adjournment debate on an issue that I have raised on a number of occasions, and that is the problem that we often encounter over conflict between various land uses. In this case it is a conflict illustrated by a number of releases and articles in the media. The conflict is about a new mine which is proposed for north-west Queensland, an area which I lived and worked in for some years and which I still visit fairly frequently because it has a history and a place in my heart. This mine is the Ernest Henry mine, which is going to be a very huge mine near Cloncurry. It will eventually mine minerals by the open-cut method which, after the mine is completed, will leave a hole in the ground 570 metres deep with a circumference of five kilometres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of conflict over the mine between conservationists, miners and other land-holders. In reading the various press releases and articles, not a lot of light is shed either on the claims and counterclaims or on what the actual facts of the issue are. For instance, this particular press release from `Australian News' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland Conservation Council spokesman Scott Johnston said basic environmental assessment, social studies and planning had not been undertaken, but Minerals and Energy Minister Tony McGrady was due this week to announce whether the Ernest Henry project, 35km north-east of Cloncurry, would go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He called on Mr McGrady to delay approval of the project, owned by mining giant MIM Holdings Ltd, until "reasonable studies" had been done to consider the environmental risks and social impacts of the development.</PARA>
<PARA>The environmental risks are considerable, but it is very hard to get accurate information about just what the state of play is. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Office of the Coordinator General had approved the final impact assessment study on virtually the same day as the study was released to referral agencies for comment, Mr Johnston said.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People . . . haven't had a chance to address the potential major environmental impact.</PARA>
<PARA>On the other side of the argument, the mines and energy minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the facts are that a mining lease application requires a lot of due process.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The due process had been followed "without compromise" after an Impact Assessment Study was called for in 1993 and a number of submissions were received from the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A spokesman for the minister said although the Mining Warden's office had recommended the project go ahead, the timing of the announcement on Ernest Henry depended on advice from the Department of Primary Industries, after its own assessments were complete.</PARA>
<PARA>So, again, we have these conflicting statements. On the one hand the Minister for Mines and Energy is saying everything is lovely and there are no problems, and on the other hand the Queensland Conservation Council is saying that the studies have not been completed, there are questions to be answered and the project should be delayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been in contact with people in the area for some weeks and visited the area just a couple of weeks ago. In fact, I spent six days in the Cloncurry, Mount Isa, Julia Creek area. I spoke to a lot of pastoral people, miners and conservationists. I visited Fort Constantine and Belinda Downs, which are two of the properties in that area. In fact, I believe the mine will be on the Fort Constantine station. There is a lot of local concern. In fact the community is quite divided. Some see that the project will bring jobs and economic prosperity to the area and others say, `We need a lot of answers yet.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues that I think the Senate and Australians ought to be concerned about, and to which I do not believe adequate answers have been given, is that the hole which is to be dug&mdash;and remember I said that eventually it would be 570 metres deep, you can imagine just how big a hole that is&mdash;will in fact go straight down into the Great Artesian Basin. That ought to be a concern to members of this Senate. It is a concern to the water resources department in Queensland. I think they would say that not all the questions they have asked have been answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that eventually the profit from the mine could be in the region of $6.4 billion. An estimate for sealing the aquifer so that the Great Artesian Basin would not be affected is in the vicinity possibly of $20 million&mdash;which is a lot of money but, in comparison to the estimated profit, is only a very small percentage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people in the area, particularly those like Bood Hickson, whose family own the Melinda Downs property and who is a conservationist and a member of the Cloncurry Landcare committee, say that `if we could simply have the aquifers sealed and have some guarantee of that, then we believe we could support the development'. But he would say that the mining leases should not be signed in a hurry, that the minerals are not going to go away and that they are going to be there for a long time. So it is worth taking time to make sure that all the questions are answered. The project should not be fast tracked, he would say. He would claim that consultation has taken place but it has certainly not been adequate. The local community is divided. But all of those in the local community, I believe, would certainly want to see questions answered.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke to people on what is called the `downs area' around Julia Creek. Most of them depend on bores from the Great Artesian Basin. They certainly want a guarantee of their water supply because they absolutely depend upon it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again in this place we are faced with these debates about land use, and I do not believe they ought to be the kind of acrimonious debates which they so often are. When I was in the area I visited another mine which is much further along the track: the Century Mine. That mine is up in the area between Mount Isa and Burketown, and there are conflicts over that mine. I understand that questions raised by Aboriginal people still need to be answered, the Burketown Shire has questions, and graziers are concerned about tenure over the pipeline easement that will go through their properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So these questions confront us. Surely in Australia we can find better ways to have development but also protect and preserve the environment without which all of us cannot survive on this planet. </PARA>

There were, I think, eight parts to the question, which arose from the time of the resignation of the previous Parliamentary Librarian, Mr Hillas MacLean in 1991. Part (6) of the question of Senator Margetts was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do the present Presiding Officers agree that 3 years uncertainty as to their departments' futures is an unwelcome and unnecessary distraction to the corporate focus of officers in both departments; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA>The answer which the Presiding Officers have given to the question is no. That, of course, is their opinion, and they are entitled to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say that the answer should be yes, that three years uncertainty as to their departments' futures is an unwelcome and unnecessary distraction to the corporate focus of officers. I feel very much for the people who work in the library who have been left in this situation for four years. The answer, though the `no' is definite, is qualified in the next sentence, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delay is regrettable&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I think it most certainly is regrettable but need not have occurred. The answer then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but has been occasioned by the stated intention of the Opposition in the Senate to oppose the Bill . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We have before the Senate the Public Service (Parliamentary Departments) Amendment 1993, which was brought in in November 1993. To avoid delay, you would have thought that you would bring a bill on, deal with it, dispose of it and then act in accordance with the decision of the parliament in relation to it. Allowing this to drag on so long exacerbates the uncertainty that the staff of the library have suffered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer goes on in relation to the opposition's stated intention to oppose the bill in the Senate to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . notwithstanding the endorsement in March 1993 of the proposed single department by the Advisory Committee to the Presiding Officers chaired by Mr Peter Nugent MP, which considered the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advisory committee was very strange. It was not a parliamentary committee. It was set up by the then Presiding Officers to advise on a particular proposal relating to the amalgamation which would change dramatically the status of the library. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer to some issue concerning this committee without going into it in detail. It was not a parliamentary committee, so it did not have privilege and was not serviced by the usual secretariats that service committees in this parliament. It just was not conducted in the usual fashion. The chairman was not a government member, which I believe is usually the case with joint committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a dissenting report from Senator Teague, former Senator Sowada and me in which we gave six reasons for dissenting from that report. I will have a chance to deal with those reasons in more detail when the bill eventually comes before the parliament for resolution. The conduct of the inquiry was the sixth reason we gave for coming to a dissenting view. We annexed as part of our report one of the submissions&mdash;and they were not public submissions because of the nature of the inquiry&mdash;from the Department of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to Senator Margetts's question goes on to indicate that it is expected that the bill will come up this session for debate. If there was a serious endeavour to do something about the library, the bill would have been brought up sooner than this and the matter resolved. I think the answer could have noted that there was a dissenting report. That is not necessary, of course, but I think that fact needs to be placed on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel very deeply for the staff of the library for what they have had to put up with in the last four years in the way of uncertainty. I welcome the bill coming before the Senate where it can be dealt with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In question time on Thursday, 30 August this year I asked the Minister representing the Treasurer a question in relation to the Reserve Bank. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can the minister confirm that the Reserve Bank still has an unequivocal policy and resolve of acting as lender of last resort to all Australian trading and savings banks?</PARA>
<PARA>At about the time I asked the question there had been some problems with some credit unions, particularly in Japan. I am aware of quite a number of telephone conversations that have transpired between the Reserve Bank and Treasury officials since I asked that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite extraordinary that it has taken the government so long to confirm that the Reserve Bank is still the lender of last resort to trading and savings banks. The question really is: does the traditional role of the Reserve Bank&mdash;that is, the lender of last resort&mdash;still apply today as it applied in the past in such a way that deposit holders feel secure that their money in banks is underwritten by guarantees from the Reserve Bank?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that I wish to raise tonight concerns compulsory member contributions. The government has announced the concept of having compulsory member contributions to superannuation funds. This is not going to be introduced without some difficulty. I flag, in advance, a number of issues I think should be addressed, because they need to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most cases, awards currently specify an amount which is less than the amount of the superannuation guarantee. As a result, in some cases employers have split the superannuation guarantee liability between two funds&mdash;the award three per cent is paid into the industry fund nominated, and the balance for superannuation guarantee purposes is paid to the employer's chosen fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compulsory member contribution&mdash;and maybe the government's matching contribution announced by the government&mdash;requires that the government's matching contribution be paid to the fund receiving the superannuation guarantee contribution.

I point out that there is a test case before the AIRC which may result in awards being amended to include the superannuation guarantee scale, so this would be a possible part resolution of the issue. Regardless of this, the matter needs to be resolved by the time the compulsory member contribution is introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that the issue of the payment of the superannuation guarantee to more than one fund should be resolved at the time awards are amended&mdash;if they are going to be amended&mdash;and at the introduction of the compulsory member contribution, thus ensuring that employers cannot, for example, move moneys between a number of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue is the government's matching contribution. The compulsory member contribution has to be paid by the 28th day of the month following deduction from the employee's pay. It will be necessary for prompt arrears procedures to be set in place by trustees to collect overdue contributions. The whole superannuation guarantee system ideally may have to move to monthly payments. Certainly, that would facilitate the system and make the process for the trustees a lot less messy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Treasury has indicated in discussions that it will be next to impossible to move to monthly payments, because of the draconian nature of the superannuation guarantee legislation, and that employers will have plenty of opportunities to breach the superannuation guarantee requirements each year, instead of only one opportunity at present. I put to the Senate that both of Treasury's concerns need to be taken into account and a workable solution which accommodates them found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The payment of the government's matching contribution will require evidence from employers, so here is another problem for the employers. That evidence would include the fund into which the superannuation guarantee and the member contribution is being paid and the amount of the employee contribution. Therefore, group certificates will need to incorporate these details, so the Taxation Office will also have to pick these up in its printing of group certificates. The other problem is that, as the government's matching contribution is paid in arrears, it is possible that some members will have left by the time it is paid. Funds are therefore potentially faced with making two benefit payments and suffering the associated cost burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the concept of the preservation of the government's matching charge and the compulsory member contribution? The compulsory member contribution for which a matching contribution is received must be preserved. This causes administrative difficulties, because the government's matching contribution is not received until the following year. So the ideal situation may be to simply preserve what is known as the compulsory member contribution. Indeed, it is reasonable that all contributions from the commencement of the compulsory member contribution and the government's matching contribution be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further change to preservation on 1 July 1996. From that time generally only ongoing member undeducted contributions are not preserved. But with the advent of the compulsory member contribution and the government member contribution as well, the preservation regime will become unintelligible to the average person. Consequently, a case could well be made for full preservation from 1 July 1996, including the removal of the $500 threshold preservation. We understand that the preservation arrangements required from 1 July 1996 will be very costly for industry to implement and, as such, urgently need simplification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the question of multiple fund membership. It will be common for part-time and casual employees to have active membership in more than one fund. So it could be deemed desirable for a general award amendment, or an amendment preferably to the superannuation guarantee charge, because it would be far better if superannuation guarantee was taken out of the award system and placed entirely under the superannuation guarantee charge, which would certainly save a lot of the sorts of problems that I am raising tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, it would be a lot simpler if there was a nominated single fund to receive all sorts of contributions, both the award contribution, if that is going to continue, as well as a pick-up from the superannuation guarantee charge. After all, we now have a transfer protocol, the idea of which is to assist in reducing the number of small account balances. But there is a potential, as a result of the issues that I have introduced tonight, of having multiple fund membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I put those matters before the Senate for consideration by the government because they are matters that really must be taken into consideration well before commencement dates. I do this to try to ensure that the superannuation system in Australia works both efficiently and effectively and does not provide too many cost compliance problems either for the trustees or for the employers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today I tabled around 2,000 petitions which were passed on to me by the Women's Electoral Lobby. I want to acknowledge that the person who put these petitions together lives in Bunbury in Western Australia. She is a single parent with young children and no car. When she started taking out these petitions, she was told that people do not really care anyway and are too complacent to sign anything controversial. That got her dander up. So, armed with handmade posters, she approached local business people asking their permission to stick the signs up in their windows and put petition boards in their stores. The response was so wonderful she had to photocopy extra blank petitions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to the secrecy provisions in the child support legislation, it is not possible to answer those questions presented by the honourable Senator which directly relate to an individual child support case. However, I can provide general responses to the honourable Senator's questions as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The amount of child support payable under an assessment is based on each parent's taxable income for the financial year two years prior to the current child support year. This amount is indexed to take account of changes in income over this period. If either parent's current income is at least 15% less than prior year taxable income, he or she can lodge an estimate of his or her current income and the CSA will issue a revised assessment. This revised assessment more accurately reflects the current financial status of the parents. Under existing legislation, when an estimate of income is processed, the monthly child support liabilities for the whole year are revised. As a result, where a non-custodial parent has already paid more than the liability accrued under the revised assessment an overpayment to the custodial parent occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Government announced in the 1995-96 Budget that the child support legislation will be changed. Credit will be given for the total paid so far in the financial year and the non-custodial parent will only pay lower amounts for the rest of the year as a result of his or her estimated lower income. This will reduce the number of overpayments to custodial parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I am unable to respond directly to this question due to secrecy provisions. The CSA can provide full details of how any debt figures have been calculated to the party concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) In past years resourcing did not permit priority to be given to recovery of overpayments which occurred in these types of cases. It is now policy to advise clients when an overpayment occurs and an agreement is sought as to how the money is to be repaid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) One of the types of arrangements which can be agreed to with a parent who has been overpaid is to repay the overpayment through reducing the amount of his or her current entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The child support legislation is based on two concepts. First, children should share in their parents' changed financial circumstances, just as they would have if the parents had continued to live together. Secondly, both parents should support their children according to their capacities to pay. It follows that if the non-custodial parent's capacity to pay changes, the amount the parent is required to pay for child support should also change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The child support legislation does require a non-custodial parent to pay child support when he or she is in receipt of income and conversely, if he or she is unemployed that parent's obligations will be reduced. However, in a number of cases non-custodial parents do not inform the CSA when they lose their job and move onto unemployment benefits. This time difference can contribute to overpayments which are largely outside the control of the CSA. However, as the Government announced in the last Budget, there will be changes made to the way Department of Social Security (DSS) information is made available to the CSA. Enhanced information exchange facilities between DSS and CSA are being developed. This will include information about non-custodial parents who are in receipt of unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Any client who has been overpaid child support is required to repay that amount. As mentioned above, the CSA will discuss with the parent as to how the overpayment can be repaid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Authority to intercept tax refund cheques is provided under section 72 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9)(a) Again, case details cannot be disclosed. However, CSA policy is that tax refunds will only be intercepted where there is no arrangement to repay an overpayment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9)(b) A decision to repay a tax refund cheque which has already been intercepted is taken by reversing the Registrar's original decision. The authority to repay a tax refund which had been intercepted exists by reversing the Registrar's original decision to apply section 72 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
