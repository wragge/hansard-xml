<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. In the light of today's current account figure of a $2.25 billion deficit, the eighth time in the last nine months that it has been over $2 billion, I ask the minister: why should not Australians take notice of the warnings made over the weekend by the chief executive of the ANZ Bank, Don Mercer, that the current account crisis could trigger another recession? Has not Mr Mercer simply highlighted yet again that the Keating budget will do nothing to bring the current account deficit down from six per cent of GDP&mdash;the very same level that prompted Mr Keating to warn of the onset of the banana republic before the last recession?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The balance of payments figures for April 1995 were released at, I think, 11.15 this morning. I want to get the balance of payments figures into the context of this answer because it is important to understand the platform upon which this question was asked. The note I have from the Bureau of Industry Economics says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If current account deficits of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion were to occur for the final two months of the 1994-95 financial year, the current account deficit for the whole of 1994-95 would be slightly lower than the revised Treasury forecast of $27 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>That is to say, for all of the reasons that we have given in response to numerous questions in the Senate, the current account has, of course, gone high but it has gone high because we have been sucking in capital goods. It has gone high because we have not been exporting as many mineral commodities, because of lack of demand in the northern hemisphere and because of the effect of the drought. Indeed, the real story of these balance of payments figures&mdash;which are below market expectations, I might say&mdash;is that the drought impact is now beginning to show up in our current account.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am saying that the drought affects our ability as an exporting nation to earn export income. That shows up in the current account. It is a reason of nature, not a reason of economics. It is an issue that Australians ought to appreciate. As soon as better climatic conditions affect our rural producers, the economy will come back into a better current account balance than it currently is.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I think I ought to give the minister a bit more time. I remind him that his budget forecast for next year is a $27 billion deficit, on top of a $27 billion deficit for this year, and that the percentage, as a percentage of GDP, is only going to be reduced marginally. The question is: what ideas do you have? What ideas are you going to implement to bring down the current account deficit? Why will you not listen to the warnings of someone like Don Mercer and actually put into place a policy prescription to address this critical issue?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, you could equally say of the opposition: why do you not actually pay attention to the structure of the economy, the changes we have made, the dividends that that is beginning to pay? Why would we start with an odd criticism from this corner or that corner when we have a long-term strategy for this economy and when, palpably, the opposition does not, never has had and has not yet produced one single new policy idea?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the level of the current account deficit, it is true that in money terms the figure forecast in this year's budget will be the same in the next out-year. But, of course, the economy will have grown so that in percentage terms the current account deficit will have fallen. That is a very fundamental question, Senator Hill. In other words, to put it simply for you, we will have improved our economic position. Perhaps for once in its life the opposition should stand up and recognise that and pay some credence to it in public debate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The $53 million package which I launched yesterday, the Commonwealth's coastal policy, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living on the coast</EMPHASIS>, is a very significant commitment to better coastal management, coming as it does on top of a range of other Commonwealth initiatives. These include $14 million extra funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, a $5 million national wetlands program, and earlier decisions, such as the saving of Jervis Bay and Shoalwater Bay. The biggest part of this package, Coastcare, will see $23 1/2 million spent on empowering community organisations to do hands-on work to protect and restore our coastal environments. It will also strengthen partnerships between community groups and local government and thus will increase participation in local planning and decision making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The universally acknowledged problem of scattered and uncoordinated decision making will be addressed not by legislation but by $8.4 million provided through the Department of Housing and Regional Development, to add value to existing planning mechanisms by ensuring that all relevant parties in a region contribute to a single, integrated planning process. What we can achieve with cooperation is agreement about the future use of important areas and certainty about agreed outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that coastal zone managers, planners, professionals and local communities have the skills to deal with coastal issues. The coastal action program includes more than $8 million to provide improved professional development and training opportunities, focus research on management problems, expand coastal monitoring and improve access to information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living on the coast </EMPHASIS>presents the Commonwealth's vision for a cooperative integrated approach to coastal management. The Commonwealth will make sure that its own coastal activities are managed sustainably. The coastal policy sets out objectives and principles which will guide the activities of all Commonwealth agencies, giving for the first time clear guidance on their responsibilities in the coastal zone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In launching the policy yesterday, I said that it is not an instant solution to coastal problems but is an excellent and comprehensive attack on the key problems and, importantly, is one that has the support of all the key stakeholders. I think this integrated cooperative approach to coastal management really has been received as a vision for the future for coasts and coastal protection in Australia. It is obvious that this package will mean that all stakeholders will be able to play their part in coastal management and ensure that we have ecologically sustainable management of our coasts in Australia. I think we will see all those involved in the coastal zone really take advantage of these opportunities. We have to remember that protection of our coasts is not only of local and regional significance but is of national and global importance. I believe the Commonwealth's coastal policy, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living on the coast</EMPHASIS>, will deliver the goods.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Two leading industry groups, the Master Builders Association and the Housing Industry Association, have accused his government of underestimating the tax take from the new 12 per cent sales tax on building materials by an incredible figure of $300 million. As former Treasurer Dawkins admitted that he deliberately fudged the 1993 budget sales and petrol tax revenue figures, what guarantees do Australians have that the government is not continuing that practice in this year's budget? Does the government stand by its figures? Will the minister release the methodology, figures and calculations used by Treasury in reaching its revenue forecasts for the building materials sales taxes or are you, in reality, just trying to hide the impact of those taxes on an industry that is already suffering a 25 per cent decline in building approvals? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question is about whether we stand by the budget estimates. Of course we do. I remind the Senate that at the time of last year's budget&mdash;about the first or second week after the budget&mdash;all sorts of people were running around with estimates about whether or not the budget forecasts were true. Indeed, that is what we expect as normal behaviour as industry and the community react to what Treasury has come forward with as reasonable estimates of growth and change. The most outstanding one I commend to the chamber for its attention now is the estimates promoted in the previous budget on investment in Australia. We were told that we were wildly inaccurate, that we could not possibly be right and that we would be absolutely shown to be wrong. In fact, we were a bit conservative and we did underestimate. For all the expert voices out there telling us that we were wrong, Treasury was closer to the outcome than just about anyone else. Do we stand by the estimates in this year's budget? Yes, we do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister failed to address that part of my question where I asked whether he will release the methodology, calculations and figures used. That is very important in light of an article in today's paper, where the Treasury official acknowledges that `we made our calculations based on our methodology and we stick by them'. If that is the case, why will the minister not table the revenue forecasts of the Treasury and acknowledge that they are flawed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not flawed. The simple reason why I will not admit that they are flawed is that I would be misleading the parliament if I did. I tell the truth; they are not flawed. They are based on tried and true methodology. Senator Tambling should not come in here and make allegations like that; they are ridiculous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will the methodology be released? My understanding is that Treasury methodology is consistent and well-known and frequently adduced in estimates proceedings, in which this chamber is about to engage. Senator Tambling may well have an opportunity to directly ask Treasury about its methodology point by point. He might learn something if he does. I do not think there is any great mystery about methodology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude on the merit of this argument: our estimate puts the figure at about $400.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators would be aware, the export of live sheep from Australia to Saudi Arabia ceased at the end of 1990 following difficulties with rejections of Australian shipments because of the incidence of scabby mouth. Earlier this year, the Saudi requirements for the resumption of this trade were encapsulated in a set of broad conditions that the Australian live sheep industry would adhere to before the AMLC would approve shipments of live sheep to Saudi Arabia. Despite the systems put in place, there was an outbreak of scabby mouth on the first shipment that departed Fremantle on 15 April. The AMLC advised me that the trader decided to divert the ship to Aqaba in early May because of an outbreak of the disease.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fate of the first shipment has raised, as far as I am concerned, a number of serious issues. These include the epidemiology of the disease, the quality assurance systems that were put into place, the issue of sheep selection and age, the impact of on-board conditions on the ability to deliver within specifications and animal welfare considerations. All of these must be examined, as far as I am concerned, in detail before further shipments will be approved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following receipt by me of a report from the AMLC on the latest shipment, I have decided to form a working group on live sheep to Saudi Arabia to perform the task. It will include senior representatives from the AMLC, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the live sheep industry. I have already had discussions on this matter with the Western Australian Minister for Primary Industry, Monty House. I will invite him, as a result of those discussions, to nominate a senior representative from Western Australia to attend those working group meetings. This invitation will be extended to other interested states. The state that is most likely to be interested, in addition to Western Australia, is South Australia. Once I have received a report from the working group, I will then reconsider the matter of live sheep exports to Saudi Arabia. I table the terms of reference for the working group.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources. Is the minister aware that there has been logging activity in the Sharpe block north of Walpole in Western Australia, despite its interim listing on the register of the national estate and despite nearly all of it being protected in the 1995 round of woodchip licences? Is he also aware that the Australian Heritage Commission has admitted that it left off coupe 6 of the Sharpe block because of an oversight? I also refer him to a letter addressed to the Prime Minister from conservationists in Western Australia, where they state that a report on illegal logging in coupes 7 and 8 of the Giblett block has been presented to the Minister for Resources. Does he agree that, since the minister has repeatedly stated publicly that such breaches will be regarded seriously and appropriate action will be taken, appropriate action could well be that rights to the Sharpe coupe 6 are forsaken because of the illegal exporting of chips by the same company in Giblett blocks 7 and 8?</PARA></TALK.START>

In approving logging in and the export of woodchips from Sharpe coupe 6, the Minister for Resources fully complied with his obligation in respect of the Australian Heritage Commission Act. Sharpe 6, together with other Western Australian national estate coupes proposed for logging in 1995, was referred to the Australian Heritage Commission for comment on 20 October 1994, and the commission provided its comments six weeks later on 5 December 1994. Sharpe 6 was on the list of coupes originally provided by the Minister for Resources to the environment department for its consideration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I again welcome the European delegation. The meeting of the Cairns Group of ministers in Manilla established a basis for a renewed international effort to address barriers to Australian agricultural exporters and agricultural exporters of other fair trading countries. It underlines the importance of the Cairns Group to our efforts to secure better access for Australia's agricultural exports and better returns for our exporters. It makes it very clear the Cairns Group is not satisfied with the result of the Uruguay Round.</PARA></TALK.START>

One goal which would seem self-evident but the significance of which should not be underestimated is to focus squarely on ensuring that people fully abide by the commitments they entered into in the Uruguay Round. That sounds like something that is so obvious it does not need saying, but early experience suggests that matter requires a lot of attention and scrutiny. We intend to make sure it receives it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue to which I wish to refer today is the second priority set by the ministers; that is, to begin to develop a new agenda for further freeing up world trade in agriculture and a commitment over the next 12 months to develop a program which we will submit to the 1996 ministerial conference on the WTO in Singapore. That will be a very important opportunity to push forward the issue of agricultural trade liberalisation. Over the next 12 months, we will be developing the Cairns Group goals for that further liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other item thing to which we wish to give emphasis and which flows logically from that point is the importance of the major markets and major economies opening up further their markets as a result of their domestic policies. Most particularly in 1995 this will be important in the United States because it is developing its new farm bill, which is before Congress. It is also important in terms of the reform of the common agricultural policy of the European Union about which I have been making representations in Brussels. We welcome the views expressed by the current president of the European Union that the enlargement of the EU will necessitate reform of the common agricultural policy. Logic has demanded it for a long time, but enlargement will make it more necessary and inevitable.</PARA>

It is not just good for our exporters; it has a rather good outcome for the importing countries as well. It is called cheaper food for their citizens. Australia has always had a rather naive view that it is a very good policy for governments to try to make food for its citizens cheaper. We have never worked out the logic of the countries which think it is a great policy initiative to make sure all their people can pay a lot more than they need to for their food.

Unofficial contacts in the past in pursuit of our economic and commercial interests have included private visits to Taiwan in October 1992 by Mr Griffiths, then Minister for Tourism and Minister for Resources, in November 1993 by Senator Cook, then Minister for Trade, and in July 1994 by Minister Lee as Minister for Tourism.

As I understand it, the group was set up by Senator McMullan in order to address this question.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On where we stand, we have been looking at what we are going to do about it. The Australian Customs Service is incorporated within my department, the Department of Industry, Science and Technology; so the submission was on a joint Customs-departmental basis. The submission focused on operational issues rather than symbolic ones and commented on the effectiveness of certain actions. It surveyed what has happened around the world with the unilateral blocking of imports; how easy or difficult this is to do and what the cost impacts are. So it is against that background that you ask this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your first part of the question is about the department's view on whether it is going to cost Australians more and whether that is the reason for inaction. The department, in its submission, recommends action; so I do not think it is fair to say, as you did in the first part of your question, that it is proposing no action. That is not the case. It is proposing actions that it believes will be effective and suggests that an industry code of conduct, which puts the onus on importers to satisfy themselves that no forced or child labour has been used in their products, would be a useful step. That is a suggestion that I think you have also made, Senator. The department endorses that, so I do not think it is fair to characterise it as having a non-action, let us not do anything, view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your second question is based again, I think, on an erroneous premise that my department has an apparent view that it should not do anything. That is not true. But it does distinguish between symbolic gestures and things that might have a real effect. I am not dismissing the importance of symbolism in an issue like this. However, in deciding between options, one would obviously think that the best options would be those that would have an effect that would bring about change rather than simply those that would have the effect of Australia declaring itself symbolically for change but not being able to deliver it and imposing on Australia and its economy high costs for that type of gesture. So we were looking at applied ways of doing things and weighing the costs against the effectiveness&mdash;not the cost of this against the advantage to the country but whether or not we would address the real issue.</PARA>

On what grounds and on whose initiative have visa laws been relaxed to allow Indonesian tourists to visit the Christmas Island casino without formally applying for a visa prior to their arrival?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue Senator Knowles refers to is essentially a continuation of a special arrangement which was put in place when Christmas Island casino was to be built. It was my decision to reintroduce the visa-free entry to the island. It was a decision taken in recognition of the fact that the island is so isolated from Australia on the one hand and is so close to a market on the other. In fact, it has attracted this market over recent years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the lead-up to the decision, extensive consultations have taken place with key agencies, including the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs Service, the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and my department. This was before the decision was made. Because of the island's isolation, we thought we could protect our borders and, at the same time, pick up the economic advantage which only Christmas Island would be able to pick up. As a consequence, both in respect of the first decision, which was taken some time in 1986, and the more recent decision, which I took towards the end of last year, our confidence in the potential to be realised has been met. The initiative, for instance, has seen the construction of a five star hotel casino with some 156 rooms on the island by the Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd.</PARA>

I therefore ask you why you reinstituted the policy. Is it at the expense of the states and territories who will stand to lose a large amount of tax revenue while the Commonwealth, your government, reaps the reward of the tax revenue of the increased tourism into Christmas Island?

I did say it was reinstituted; I did not say it was continued. I did say it was not at the expense of others, and the initial trial period reflected that. The resort has been picking up people who otherwise would not have access to our visa processing and who also would not make the trip to other casinos in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Hill this day, relating to the balance of payments.</PARA>
<PARA>One reason why this government deserves to be thrown out of office is its total failure to address the current account crisis that we now face. It was demonstrated again today by Senator Cook, who simply was not able to provide any answer at all as to what the government would do to reduce that current account deficit. The figure which came out today indicated another $2.25 billion deficit&mdash;the eighth deficit over $2 billion in the last nine months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us reflect back to 1986, when the current account deficit in this country was running at an annual rate of $12 billion a year and foreign debt was $85 billion. That is when Mr Paul Keating said that we were headed towards a banana republic. That is when the current account figure was somewhere near six per cent of GDP. Where are we now, some nine years later? Our current account deficit has gone from $12 billion annually to $27 billion and is expected, on the government's own figures, to be $27 billion next year. Our foreign debt has gone from $82 billion to $162 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in exactly the same cycle as we were before&mdash;the current account out of control, month after month, with debt levels that simply cannot be sustained, leading to ever increasing foreign debt, pressure on interest rates and great concern for the economic future of this country. Of course, as a percentage of GDP, it is back up to Mr Keating's banana republic figure of six per cent. The government's own forecast in this budget only puts the reduction to 5.5 per cent. That is, if everything goes right for the government in this next year&mdash;and there is not much economically going right now&mdash;it will only be marginally reduced, still at an unsustainable level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is more than reasonable, therefore, that we ask the Minister representing the Treasurer what the government is going to do about it. He was simply not able to give a satisfactory answer. He muttered something about the fact that it is to do with sucking in capital goods. In fact, it seems that, in this month's figures, the percentage made up of capital goods has been reduced. It is an unsatisfactory answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the messengers because it is not just us who have been saying this to the government. Time after time it has been said by respected economists and respected business people in the community that this level of deficit, this level of debt, simply cannot be sustained. I remind the Senate of what Mr Don Mercer said this last weekend, which was the basis of the question that was asked. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think our current account is a serious weakness and I could talk about that for some time. What is particularly disturbing about it is that it is showing no signs of improvement. . . . we have to service the debt we've already got.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Something in excess of two per cent of GNP is where we need to be . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He was asked: what is the consequence if we do not get it right? Don Mercer, from the ANZ Bank, a highly respected economic commentator in our community, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you remember the banana republic; the recession we had to have? We have another one of those.</PARA>
<PARA>But is the government listening to that? Of course, it is not. Mr Mercer said&mdash;and he is absolutely correct:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And each time we go through that experience we come up with higher underlying debt, higher underlying structural unemployment and with basically a lot of problems that we don't need.</PARA>
<PARA>He is not the only business leader to have been saying it in recent times. I remind the Senate also of the words of Mr Ian Salmon, the Chairman of the Business Council of Australia, who, only a few days ago, delivered an important speech in this city in which he particularly addressed the budget and the failure, in his terms, of the budget to deliver more growth and prosperity to Australia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget does nothing to lift the growth in Australia to the sort of level that is necessary if we are going to return this country to the top 10 of wealthy nations by the year 2010.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a reasonable objective on the part of the Business Council of Australia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget does nothing to improve national savings for the year 1995 and 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>He also made the point in passing that the little fiscal tightening that is in the budget is a responsibility that has actually been passed on to business to bear rather than government taking its share of the burden. He is, of course, talking about a budget that so substantially increases taxation. It is a crisis that is facing this country.

For every comment of an alarmist kind from someone like Don Mercer, we can find a much more measured and balanced comment from someone like Don Stammer, for example, who I saw and heard on television this morning making a very different analysis of the present situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current account deficit fell slightly in April due to a fall in the merchandise trade deficit driven by a fall in imports. It is the case that the dollar figure remained high with the $2.4 billion current account deficit figure in December and the $2.3 billion one in January being the highest monthly deficits on record. In absolute terms, they are clearly not the highest as a proportion of GDP. If you go back to 1989-90, you can see monthly deficits of close to this amount being recorded on at least a couple of occasions when nominal GDP was obviously very much lower. That is also true for the period back in the mid-1980s&mdash;1986&mdash;that Senator Hill was waxing indignant about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do take very seriously the issue of the current account deficit. The 1995-96 budget included major structural initiatives that will reduce that deficit in both the short term and the longer term. The government did undertake a significant tightening, as we all should be aware, of fiscal policy in the May budget&mdash;a dramatic tightening, in fact&mdash;and also introduced superannuation initiatives to boost national saving and to reduce Australia's call on overseas capital. That is the crucial need when we are talking about the current account&mdash;taking measures right across the  spectrum to boost savings to reduce the call on overseas capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very short term it is the case next year that the nominal deficit is expected to remain unchanged at $27 million but because of GDP growth that will fall to 5 1/2 per cent of GDP from six per cent this year. The trend is going in that direction and the other substantial structural measures will continue to cut in and work away to produce a further decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More important than the size of the deficit is its composition and the circumstances that have led to its change. Let me mention them: first, there has been a surge in imports of capital equipment, which is part of the general surge in productive investment associated with a very strong economy. Investments now forecast to grow by an extraordinarily strong 23 per cent in 1994-95 and of course this is sucking in imports of capital equipment. Secondly, we face the problem of the unsynchronised nature of the world recovery, which has meant that Australian demand for imports has picked up ahead of world demand for Australian exports. While the US economy has also experienced very strong growth, Germany, for example, has thus far experienced a much more subdued and less broad-based recovery and Japan is only just now recovering from the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there has been a structural change in the economy, such as the fact that as a result of tariff reform we are in a transition phase on the path to greater export diversity with the initial impact being of raising import intensity. Falling world commodity prices have seen Australia's terms of trade decline over the last several decades, making it harder to balance our trade without structural reform on the export side. A fourth consideration is, as Senator Cook pointed out, the drought, which is continuing to adversely affect rural exports. They fell eight per cent in seasonally adjusted terms in April, reflecting that weakness in the rural sector. That is there before our eyes&mdash;an eight per cent fall in April, directly attributable to the drought. Finally, there is the rise in world interest rates, which add to debt servicing costs and the net income deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to all of these phenomena, it is important to appreciate the way in which our manufacturing export base does continue to expand. It continues to respond very well to the improved economic environment. Our international competitiveness has improved by nearly 40 per cent since the early 1980s and has been further helped by low inflation and wage rises and strong productivity growth. Exports, in  particular, of elaborately transformed manufactures, which are the real indicator of the strength and sophistication of the Australian economy, grew by 13 per cent through 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the overall situation is really very strong so far as the basic fundamentals of the Australian economy are concerned. For a whole variety of reasons we do have an acknowledged current account deficit problem. That is the only thing the opposition can find to get its rocks off about at the moment because that is the only aspect of the economy which is not showing starkly and clearly the returns that we would ideally like. But we have put in place the structural changes that are necessary to address that in the longer term and in the short term we can be reasonably confident that there will be a significant turnaround. It is already happening now and will continue to happen in the next financial year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The thing that most disturbs me and most Australians in listening to people like Senator Cook and Senator Gareth Evans is the absolutely frightening complacency that the government is showing towards the overwhelming economic problem that we have with our external accounts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook, in his answer today, of which we are taking note, said that the whole problem we now have is due to capital goods imports and the drought. He called it simply a transitional and climatic problem. I do not know what Senator Cook's definition of a transitional problem is, but we have a problem today of the same magnitude in terms of the proportion of the economy involved as the one we had in May 1986, when the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, said that if we continued on the road we were on, we would become a banana republic. That had a very striking impact on Australians, because it did bring home the magnitude of the problem. That problem was largely caused by then Treasurer Keating's own economic policies in the preceding two or three years. But he did draw attention to that fact. It was reasonable that average Australians like me would expect the government to do something to solve that problem on a long-term structural basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have Senator Cook, Senator Evans, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Treasurer Willis carrying on like this. They say that all the structural changes have been put in place, that we now have a transitional problem and that, after that, everything will be rosy. We heard all of that in 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1990, when we had the recession that we had to have to put these structural changes in place. Simply nothing has happened other than a deterioration of the position in the last few years after an admittedly small improvement in the balance of payments situation in the late 1980s and very early 1990s as a result of the worst recession that we have had since the Depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That recession should never have occurred. It was not a recession that we had to have. It was a recession we had because of the incompetence and policy failures of the Keating-Hawke government before then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of all that, we have seen our debt escalate to $180,000 million per year. The cost of interest on that debt last year was $22,000 million. It will be of the same magnitude in the year that we are just completing. Depending on international interest rates, it will be even higher next year. There will probably be higher interest rates on a higher level of debt. </PARA>

I agree with that. The one small problem with that is that the budget does nothing to solve our long-term savings problem. Indeed, it exacerbates the problem. The government says that this budget will be accompanied by a balance of payments deficit in the next financial year, 1995-96, of exactly the same magnitude as this year, which is an all time record and, on the government's own description, if one believes the 1986 description, will lead to a banana republic situation.

<PARA>My question sought several answers from the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Cook, which were not satisfactorily addressed. Firstly, I referred to Mr Dawkins' admission in respect of the 1993 budget's fudged sales and petrol tax figures. Senator Cook invited me to step outside the parliament and repeat those remarks! I do not have to do that because Mr Dawkins has already gone on the record over this issue. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 9 February this year, in a major interview with regard to tax rises and other aspects of the budget, Mr Dawkins stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I knew there was going to be a somewhat larger revenue harvest than I was prepared to factor in. Had there not been another dollar of expenditure the deficit would have come down much quicker.</PARA>
<PARA>There are other statements by Mr Dawkins in that particular interview in which he acknowledges that the 1993 budget was certainly fudged. I am very concerned that this year's budget has similarly been fudged with regard to this 12 per cent slug on building materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget estimates have indicated that the revenue to be raised is some $215 million. It is very interesting to note that both the Master Builders' Association of Australia and the Housing Industry Association have done a detailed analysis and they do not come up with anything like the same revenue estimates. To quote from an HIA document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget estimates the revenue gain will be $125 million in 1995-96 and $245 million in 1996-97. The HIA estimates the additional revenue will be at least $550 MILLION a year! The gain in revenue will be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.   repairs and maintenance       $144 million</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.   renovations and additions     $160 million</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.   new dwellings                 $146 million</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">    Total                          $550 million.</PARA>
<PARA>Today I sought to have Senator Cook release details of Treasury's methodology for the calculation of the figures it used to put together its estimate. Of course, he avoided doing so. Why did he avoid it? Very obviously, there has been a political manipulation of this year's budget and he cannot produce the calculations. I challenge him to produce them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very interesting to note in today's media the debate on this same issue. A spokesman for the Treasurer, Mr Willis, said last night that the government stood by its calculations on the revenue from the building tax. The spokesman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have had discussions with industry on this and they presented their figures based on their methodology. We made our calculations based on our methodology and we stick by them.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is the case, I ask Senator Cook to table the relevant documents in here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook suggested that a line of questioning to elicit that information could be adopted at the senate estimates committee. Why is he not prepared to give that information in the senior chamber, here in the Senate? I can assure him that Senator Short and I would certainly take up that challenge and we will ask the Treasury officials for much more information in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sales tax slug of 12 per cent will have a very dramatic effect throughout Australia. In every area of home building, in every area of renovation, in every area of office construction it will have a pass-on effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been crowing about the changes this budget makes in the area of superannuation&mdash;changes to compensate for its walking away from its promised tax cuts&mdash;but those changes do nothing to help any self-funded retiree. Similarly, this 12 per cent slug on building materials will have a major effect on self-funded retirees because many of those people rely on improvements or changes to their housing and domestic status. So there is a straight 12 per cent tax that will affect all aged people who chose to change their housing status at the important point of their retirement. Yet the government will not come clean and release the methodology of its calculations and recognise the consequences these measures will have on the housing industry and all Australian families. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

In response to a dorothy dix from his own side, the minister admitted that the only thing the federal government has done to help small business is set up a working party. Is that not great?

<PARA>Madam Deputy President, Ray Devlin was born in Burnie, Tasmania, on 17 March 1926. Starting his working life early, he left school at the age of 14 to take a job at Rosebery, where he worked as a miner for 4 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After gaining membership of the Waterside Workers Federation, Ray began his lifelong work on the Burnie waterfront, where he was employed for some 34 years until his election to the Senate in late 1984. Ray was always proud of the fact that he had come to parliament with many years experience as a working man and as a member of the trade union movement. He was a life member of the Waterside Workers Federation, and his commitment to the union movement was manifested by his 27-year stint as Secretary of the Burnie Trades and Labour Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ray Devlin committed himself to representing the views of the ordinary working man and woman throughout his parliamentary career. In his maiden speech, he referred to the importance of the union movement in winning better conditions for the working man but working to resist changes which might run counter to the best interests of the worker. He had first-hand experience of the detrimental effect the technological revolution could have on employment. His speech touched on the other issues that most concerned him and which he felt warranted pursuit from his new position. Not surprisingly, these included industrial relations and the role of government in the pursuit of social justice and equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ray's approach to issues was always from the perspective of the individual. He never forgot, as he used to put it, `that behind statistics lie people like us'. At the start of his parliamentary career, his hope was that this idealism of a kind expressed by all newly elected senators at the time would not be short lived. In Ray's case, there was no doubt that he remained true to his ideals. He championed workers' rights and he held firm to his belief in the principles of unionism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his time here, Ray was a tireless committee worker. He served five years on the Library Committee and the Publications Committee and on the Select Committee on Animal Welfare, completing its inquiry as Chairman, and the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, among others. He also served on the joint committees on the Australian Capital Territory and the new Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ray Devlin, as I remember him and as others here will, was a friendly and decent character who was as much respected by his colleagues as he was by the general work force in Parliament House. He became known as the unofficial Parliament House shop steward for championing the cause of the workers that kept this place going&mdash;so much so that, when he retired in 1990, he was presented with a gift from the Senate staff. Notwithstanding the relatively short period of his service as a senator&mdash;Ray Devlin was with us right through the latter eighties, from 1984 to 1990&mdash;he will be remembered fondly by all of us with whom he worked. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife Vurlie&mdash;who was a great support for Ray and who was a very familiar face around the parliament&mdash;and his family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

I had not been on the animal welfare committee for long before I was able to recognise his genuine interest in and concern for the welfare of animals. Although it was not a long time that we shared a space on that committee, I soon detected his personal fascination with equine welfare in particular.

Ray confided that he did not think it would be the best thing for the two senators to wear their coats when they went to this race track where the greyhound was to run. So they at least had the dignity, knowing all the procedures about clothing in this chamber, to take their coats off and go coatless while this greyhound went and won the race against the local competition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to pay tribute to the late Ray Devlin, senator for Tasmania between 1984 and 1990. Ray devoted his life to the working people of Tasmania in his role as a workplace union delegate for the waterside workers in Burnie, as secretary for the Burnie branch of the Trades and Labour Council and later as a senator. I served with Ray on various committees within the Labor Party in Tasmania for over a decade. I know from those experiences that Ray was tough and uncompromising in his principles but was always fair. He knew in his own mind the minimum standards he would accept and he always tried to transpose those standards to the people he represented. Life's path often takes one along a route that one would never have envisaged. Ray Devlin made this statement in his first speech. He never imagined that, as a worker in a mine at 14, he would end up representing his state in the Senate&mdash;and he was very proud of that achievement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On completing his term in the Senate, Ray continued his work to ensure employment opportunities were maximised in Tasmania. When a saw mill was struggling to survive, Ray, together with a committee from the Burnie branch of the Trades and Labour Council, stepped in and assisted. He used his contacts to seek orders for sawn timber and sell the residue in the form of woodchips. The mill would not have survived without his intervention. Today that mill still survives, employing 20 people. That is a credit to Ray. Ray Devlin will be sadly missed by those who knew and loved him. I offer my deepest sympathy to his devoted wife Vurlie, and to Michael, Vicky and Tony, together with their families. </PARA>

My association with the late Senator Devlin goes back to when I was President of the Royal Agricultural Society in Tasmania. We used to have a few problems with the Showman's Guild in those days and that is when I first got to know Ray Devlin. Through mutual friends that we acquired over the years in the Showman's Guild, I became quite close to Ray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this place you become closer to some members and senators than to others. Ray was one of my closer friends, so I was very sad not to have been able to see Ray before he passed away. I made a couple of attempts but, unfortunately, in recent times I had other things on my mind when I travelled to the north-west coast and I seemed to run out of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am well aware of the great mateship, friendship and love that he and Vurlie had for each other. If we look at Ray's valedictory, we see it all summed up when he said, `On a personal note I must pay tribute to the tireless and unselfish support given to me by my wife, Vurlie.' I think he played down the role Vurlie played in his life. She was a great companion and a great mate to him the whole time he was here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a very proud No. 1 badge holder of the Showman's Guild of Tasmania.

I  remember working with him on more than one occasion to try to calm down the sorts of problems that arose between the Showman's Guild and agricultural shows not just in Tasmania but all the way up the eastern seaboard. He was very good at that. </PARA>

We started at track work at 4 o'clock in the morning. We were still working at 4 o'clock that afternoon. Even though we were accused in the media of being on a bit of a junket, we realised&mdash;Ray, in particular&mdash;that in the course of that inquiry we had to see the hardest and best race in the world if we were going to put down a complete report. Unfortunately the report did not go into as much detail as Ray would have liked. If he had his time over again, I am sure he would have concentrated on more aspects of the horse racing industry. As has been said, he was very concerned about the industry and what was happening to it. </PARA>

I did not really get to know Ray until 1979, when I became secretary of what was then the Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union. Ray had represented our union on the north-west coast  without pay. He represented our union on the north-west coast because we had no full-time union official in that area. He was very dedicated and committed to the rights of workers across the industrial spectrum. I particularly noticed this in the work he performed for our organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>

He was always a committed trade unionist and a committed worker, as all speakers today have noted. He never lost those values. He never changed those basic principles or that outlook on life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I got to know Ray much better when I moved to the north-west coast some six years ago. Particularly in the last two years when I had my home and office in Burnie, Ray and Vurlie would often come down and have a cup of tea. We talked primarily about two issues. I had been painting my home for the last two years. Ray was very good at giving me tips about how to do the work. I did not realise until the last few weeks prior to his death that Ray had actually been an apprentice painter. That was one of the very diverse occupations he had during his working life. The other issue which we would talk about was a pretty hot issue for Tasmania&mdash;forestry. I will not go into it in detail now. Ray and I would often talk about forest related matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way Ray coped over the last couple of months, when it became apparent that he did not have much longer to live, is a tribute to the courage of the man. He really did suffer enormously in the last couple of months. It was quite heart rending to see him when I visited him on a number of occasions. You could see the tremendous pain and the difficulty he was going through during that time. Through and despite the enormous pain, he always had a laugh, a smile and a story to tell. He fought right up to the last few hours of his life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too want to join with those colleagues who have risen in this condolence debate to pay a tribute to Ray Devlin, the former senator&mdash;the man, the husband and the father. I first got to know Ray when he came to this place. He, Senator Cooney and I were elected on the same day. We arrived at this place as rank novices, not knowing where to go or what to do. The three of us got rooms in what became somewhat infamously known as the Senate side of the chamber. There we formed a very close bond of friendship, not only between us as individual members of parliament but also between our spouses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vurlie continued to work with him, as she had done throughout their married life. She was in his office, constantly looking after him&mdash;not only looking after him but also those of his mates around him. I am proud to stand here and record the fact that he saw me as a mate of his and that I, in turn, saw him as a mate of mine. I say that in the nicest Australian way in which mateship is formed in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I knew he was a strong individual; he had to be strong to have survived the rigours of the life which he had led. It is on the record of this place that he started work at a very young age. He changed his age in order to be allowed to work legally under ground in the mines in Tasmania. That required courage. He certainly showed that courage very early in his life. It was also courageous to be associated from time to time with the trade union movement in this country. Ray never hid his light under a bushel when it came to saying where he came from or where he was. He continued to associate with the trade union movement. When he was a senator he did not feel that he had left the trade union movement, particularly the organisation he loved most of all&mdash;the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia. He continued to work for that association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention has been made of the fact that after he left this place he continued to work for the Burnie Trades and Labour Council. It was only a couple of years ago, as Senator Murphy will recall, that that organisation put on a retirement function for him. It was in Burnie in 1993. I had the pleasure of attending and renewing the friendship and acquaintance not only with Ray but also with his wife, Vurlie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Great sympathy has to be directed to Vurlie. She and Ray were very close, much closer than most of the people and their  partners that are involved in this political game. When he became sick it was a strength to him and to her that their love was so strong. The second last time I spoke to the man I was amazed how strong he was. He had just left hospital. He had been diagnosed as having terminal cancer. He knew his end was coming. We all address ourselves as to how we will react when we get that news. He decided to take charge of things for himself and his family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke to him only a day after he left hospital. He was arranging a meeting for later in the week with the whole family. He knew they were going to suffer in the coming days and weeks and he was going to try and make it as easy as possible for them. That shows a strength of character and I hope that when my time comes I can be as strong as Ray Devlin was. I spoke to him again when I was overseas and that meeting with his family had taken place. He figured he had done whatever he could to prepare his family for the inevitability that was going to strike them. I think that says much about Ray Devlin, the man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about his work in the Senate. Probably the greatest mark he made in this place was as an advocate for the working people in this place. He stood by the catering staff when they were faced with retrenchment, when they were being paid a pittance. Some of the people working in catering were actually receiving top-up benefits from Social Security. When that was revealed around the place and to their union and to Ray Devlin, he took it on with a passion that only a person from the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia could demonstrate. It was quite a successful campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He did regret, however, that he was not in this place when the parliamentary catering service was privatised. He certainly had strong views on that. Despite the fact that he was no longer in parliament, he was quite willing to share those views with anybody who was prepared to listen and to place on the record what we should be doing in order to protect those workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another body of workers around this place that he was particularly close to was the Comcar drivers. They have also been under some pressures in recent years, and he had strong views as to what should happen in that area. I am sure that, if Ray Devlin had remained in the parliament after June 1990, he would have been making life somewhat difficult for some of the ministers and bureaucrats who are associated with Comcar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that what his colleagues are doing today is not so much weeping over Ray Devlin but rather speaking in joy of the man that they knew. He was a great Australian, a great Tasmanian and a great representative of the working-class people of this country. His record is there, and it is now up to his family to glory in the fact that they are associated with that record. </PARA>

As everyone has also said already, in the whole time he was here, he did not change from how he was throughout his life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a real stalwart of the north-west coast of Tasmania. As long-time secretary of the Burnie Trades and Labour Council, he acted on behalf of not only the waterside workers but also members of various other unions, especially those that otherwise did not have full-time representation in the area. He was very much seen as a central representative of the trade union movement on the north-west coast.

She did not see the first sitting, being instead in the Canberra hospital preparing for surgery due to her accident. Naturally, that day and the immediate days which followed were stressful for my wife, my two sons and for me. Yet, in the midst of our efforts to cope with a quite unexpected event, a magnificent arrangement of flowers arrived for Dawn at the hospital, having been sent by Ray and Vurlie. It was an extremely kind gesture, one that Dawn and I will never forget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the pragmatism which pervades this parliament, some of us occasionally bend our principles to achieve a result which is not what we are aiming for but which we can live with.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has already been mentioned, Ray was unashamedly a champion of the worker. Many in this building are aware of his efforts to assist them in times of industrial dispute. He was so highly regarded by members of what I might call the general staff that one of them actually travelled to Tasmania for his funeral service. I recall his anguish when a picket was placed on the entrances to Parliament House during one dispute. He knew he had a responsibility to attend the parliament, but he said to me, `I don't know what to do. I've never crossed a picket line in my life.' Fortunately, senators and members were exempted from crossing the line. Ray was able not only to attend parliament but also to take part in negotiations on behalf of the workers in the parliament building itself. </PARA>

I have known Ray and Vurlie Devlin for some period of time and have developed a great deal of respect for both of them. Our association has not always been one in which we agreed. We came from different factions of the party but that never stopped us from being able to get on together. In later years I developed a very good friendship with both Ray and Vurlie. They were great contributors to the party. Vurlie Devlin was probably one of the major fundraisers for the party during the 1980s.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ray Devlin, as I think Senator Evans said, was the epitome of a working class representative. His working life commenced in the mines in Rosebery at the age of 14. Prior to commencing work there he went to stay with his sister for a holiday after he left school. I do not know whether school was so difficult that he needed a holiday after it but that is where he went. It was suggested by his brother-in-law that he should try to get a job at the mine. Ray went along to do that but you could not start work at the mine, at least above ground, unless you were 18. So he trotted along and said he was 18 but unfortunately he was informed that there were no jobs above ground, although there were jobs underground for which you had to be 19. So Ray went back a few days later and dutifully informed them that he had turned 19. He worked there for another 4 1/2 years and then came back to Burnie, where he became a member of the Waterside Workers Federation. He worked on the waterfront for 33 years and 11 months and participated in many difficult times from an industrial point of view during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He became the secretary of the Burnie Trades and Labour Council, a position which he held for 27 years. He was also one to participate in the community. He was the boxing instructor for the Police and Citizens Boys Club for 17 years&mdash;and not without some success, because Ray helped to train nine Tasmanian champions and 14 schoolboy champions, and promoted for the club the professional light and heavyweight championships of Australia, refereed by Arthur Tunstall, a less famous person today than he might have been then. The boxer trained by Ray won the title, which attracted some funds for the club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ray always sought to help people throughout his life, right until the day he died. There are a few stories which I would like to tell relating to Ray's experiences when he was secretary of the Burnie Trades and Labour Council. These stories do not relate to industrial disputes, they relate to people within the community who Ray helped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One was a woman who had purchased a second-hand car from a well-known car dealer on the north-west coast. Not long after taking delivery of the car, it broke down. Ray came to hear about this. He sought her out and they had a talk about it. The car dealer was, and still remains, quite well known for some infamous slogans that he uses to sell cars. At that time he had one called `war on prices&mdash;WOP'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After hearing the woman's story about the circumstances in which she found herself, with little money and a broken down car of which she had just taken delivery, Ray went to see the car dealer. Ray said, `It's WOP, war on prices. If we don't fix this thing up, there is another definition of WOP and you're likely to find out about it.' Of course, following that discussion, the woman was given another car by the car dealer. In fact, it was probably better than the one she started out with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That became a bit of a story in the local community. Another woman heard about that story. She somehow took a car on trial. She went to Ray and said, `I had to pay this car dealer a $500 deposit. I took this car on trial to see if it was any good. They came and took the car back when I said it was no good but they won't give me my $500 back.' Ray said, `We'll have to sort that out for you.' He sought to make some inquiries. He had a meeting with the Burnie Trades and Labour Council executive. Two of the officers, Norm Britton and Ray Grundy, were given the task of getting further information about the woman and the $500 that had been paid. Ray said, `I'll go and see the car dealer, we'll soften him up and see if we can sort this out.' Following that discussion with the car dealer there was another meeting at the Trades and Labour Council at which Ray was informed by Norm Britton and Ray Grundy that the girl had never paid a $500 deposit. So some apologies and a working out of that issue had to be taken up with the car dealer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The efforts which Ray put into the Burnie community were ultimately recognised. In 1990 the Burnie City Council awarded Ray a certificate of merit for his efforts and for his services to the community. From an industrial point of view, of course, there would not have been a dispute on the north-west coast or, indeed, probably in Tasmania, in which Ray Devlin was not involved in some form or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know from my own experience with the APPM dispute that Ray's knowledge and association with the police in particular were very handy. His communication skills at that level were invaluable during that dispute. His services to the trade union movement have also been recognised by the fact that he was made a life member of the Waterside Workers Federation, which is now the MUA. He was made a life member of the Transport Workers Union, the FEDFA, the painters and decorators and the CFMEU. He was a life member and No. 1 ticket holder of the Showmen's Guild. As I understand it, they are not going to award that to anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, Ray continued to pursue the interests of people who needed assistance right until the day he died; so much so that even when Ray was in hospital he used to ring me about a particular issue relating to forestry. He was representing a person who was seeking a woodchip licence. We used to talk about how we were going to achieve that. I talked to Ray just days before he died. He had wished that we could resolve this issue before he died. Unfortunately, we could not. </PARA>

When Stephen Loosley's farewell speeches were made in this place there was a recognition of the fact that Stephen Loosley defended the indefensible. He came in here plenty of times to defend government policy but within the committee milieu was able to listen to other points of view and use his influence to effect an outcome which often did not flow from preconceived policies. So it was with Ray Devlin. On committees he quite frequently came forward with some views and supported others which were based not on preconceived ideas but on the evidence that was put before the committees. That is something that is important for this chamber. He then assisted this chamber in exercising that role. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The terms of this matter of public importance, as set out in my letter to the President, spring from personal experiences that I have had in the last couple of weeks and over the last couple of months, often in meeting small business people. To a man and woman, they would be absolutely disgusted by the comments that the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, made in a series of post-budget media appearances as he went from town to town, city to city and radio studio to radio studio to sell his so-called budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us on this side of the chamber who have witnessed the results of Mr Keating going from radio station to radio station to sell the so-called budget would encourage him to do more of it. The more he goes around, the more people will understand that the budget was not a budget. The closest the budget comes to being any sort of credible financial document is when we compare it with the forecasts and predictions in the prospectuses of groups like Qintex, the Bond Corporation and Rothwells merchant bank in the late 1980s. The underlying assumptions in the budget have about as much credibility as the forecasts in those more interesting documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said of small business people:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If they are feeling the pinch, they ought to say, `Small business is not for me', because it is never going to get any better. This is as good as it ever gets. So, if they are feeling the pinch, they have got to say, `I had better go back to PAYE employment.'</PARA>
<PARA>I have spoken to a lot of small business people&mdash;mostly in my home town of Perth&mdash;since the Prime Minister made that comment and they are disgusted. This matter of public importance relates to the Prime Minister's incredible arrogance in making remarks that show him to be very much out of touch with reality and with the important role of the small business sector. I am very pleased to see the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) in the chamber because I know that he understands that importance. I hope that he will explain it to his Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to note some statistics that would be well known to the minister. They bear repeating because the Prime Minister needs reminding of what small business people contribute to this nation, not only to our social and economic wellbeing of Australia, but to the employment situation. They are the heart and soul of our private sector and provide an incredible range of services to our community. They provide employment and security for thousands of families. They are great employment generators and great potential employment generators in an expanding nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently, there are 865,636 small businesses in Australia. That number probably changes by a couple of hundred every day as new businesses start up and old ones die. Of all businesses in Australia, 96 per cent are classified as small business. They provide 55 per cent of total employment within the private sector. They contribute something in the order of 43 per cent of our gross domestic product. There are more employees in that sector than there are total enrolments in the trade union movement. Even before the budget, this sector paid more in taxes into Commonwealth revenue than did all of big business put together. Small business is the engine room of the economy. It is the innovator in the economy, the first to pick up and promote new ideas. It is very important to future employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is crucial to analyse the words of the Prime Minister when he says that this is as good as it ever gets. I put it to the Prime Minister and to the minister that if small business is faced with that reality, as the Prime Minister sees it, we are all&mdash;not just small business people&mdash;in very serious trouble. Young people are suffering an enormous unemployment problem. In excess of 312,000 people under 24 do not have jobs. Over 74,000 young people have not had a job for a year. The small business sector can make an enormous contribution if it is allowed to expand and succeed. If this is as good as it ever gets for small business, it is not good enough. Things must get a hell of a lot better for small business if the young people who are looking for jobs are to find those jobs and if we are to solve some of the significant economic, social and cultural problems that we face as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a number of economic indicators that would lead our small business people to agree with my proposition that this is not as good as it gets. For example, we are told that we have low interest rates. The most recent issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine shows that Australia, and our small businesses in particular, suffer some of the highest interest rates in the world. Real interest rates&mdash;roughly speaking, when you take the inflation rate away from our prime bank rates or interest rates&mdash;are among the highest real interest rates in the world. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>'s latest survey shows that only Canada has higher real interest rates. So our business people are paying nearly the highest real interest rates in the Western world. For them, it is not as good as it should get; it is not as good as it ever gets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I know that you mix with people from small business and you would understand that, when small business seeks to expand and find new opportunities for the partners and the employees, costs such as interest rates and taxation make it very difficult for them. We have to ask whether the Prime Minister is correct when he says that this is as good as it ever gets. We have to look at inflation. If we turn to page 118 of the 13 May edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> we find that Australia has the third highest consumer price index amongst the OECD nations. The Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, will come in here and tell us that we have a low inflation economy. I guess we have lower inflation than we had during the 1970s and the 1980s, but in comparison with our trade competitors and in terms of relativities Australia has the third highest inflation rate in the Western world. I refer the minister to page 118 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The band of economic forecasters who write for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> predict that next year Australia is going to be amongst the highest inflation rate nations in the world. That is very, very hard for small business. It is particularly hard on those who seek to create some savings and invest those savings in the future expansion of their businesses. Those savings will be whittled away by 3.94 per cent inflation&mdash;a much higher rate than we have had in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues Senator Minchin and Senator Ian Macdonald will expand on the plight of small business in the post-budget era. This budget was marked by one thing as far as small business is concerned. As it affects small business, it was one of the highest taxing budgets in the last 20 years. Only two other budgets have contained larger tax slugs on small business: the Keating budget of 1984 and the Whitlam budget of 1974. Small business is already predicting reductions in sales. According to all the surveys conducted by the various chambers of commerce, small business will be reducing the number of employees being put on their payrolls in the next 12 months. This budget has done nothing to improve the outlook for small business. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction I rise to speak on behalf of the government on this matter of public importance proposed by Senator Campbell. In the last three or four weeks we have seen a bit of a flurry from those on the other side about their interest in small business. That is welcome because it has been a long time since any Liberal senator has shown any interest in speaking on small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a very negative thrust; trying to exaggerate the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and use them to show that he does not care about small business. I would like to see Liberal Party senators get up and explain exactly their specific policies for small business. There was not the slightest illumination from Senator Campbell, an opposition front bencher, about what the opposition would do for small business if it wins government. There was no specific policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where we have the so-called policy-free zone of the Liberal Party. It does not want to announce policies in any area at all. Despite the fact that Mr Howard, the new Leader of the Opposition, has said that he is interested in small business policy and attracting the support of the small business community, he is yet to announce any policy&mdash;other than some vague reference to industrial relations that may or may not affect small business. We are still waiting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been to a number of forums. Only two weeks ago I was at a forum in Newcastle in the Hunter valley. Senator Tierney referred to that forum today in question time. He was there. Ms Judi Moylan, the shadow minister for small business, was also there. She made an impassioned speech about her interest in small business; how she had come from the small business sector. But we all waited to hear what the Liberal Party would do for small business that was different from what the government was doing. There was not one word&mdash;not one mention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how long the Liberal Party believes that it can go on saying, `Elect us, but we do not want to tell you what the policies are and why we ought to be elected to government.' Sooner rather than later, the Liberal Party is going to be in considerable difficulty with its credit in the electorate. This is the real issue in this debate today and in other debates in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear vitriolic attacks on the Prime Minister at a personal level, completely exaggerating and taking his remarks out of context. His remarks were very simple. When we have five per cent growth, as we had in 1994, and two per cent inflation&mdash;unheard of figures in Australia's economic history over the last 30 or 40 years&mdash;people have the opportunity to do well in business. The Prime Minister has said on a number of occasions subsequently that he was not attacking small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was with him at a business function in Adelaide 2 1/2 weeks ago when he made it very clear that he supported and understood the contribution of small business. Those opposite who want to attack the Prime Minister should remember that his own father ran a very successful small business. He comes from a family environment where he has knowledge of small business. All this rhetoric, abusing the Prime Minister and claiming that he does not understand small business, is not right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On small business we are. We have given more concessions in the small business area than the Liberal Party ever thought of when it was in government. The opposition has not talked about any particular policy. One of the most astonishing things is that at the meeting in the Hunter Valley Ms Moylan read out a letter from the Leader of the Opposition saying, `We will oppose every increase in tax in this budget. We will oppose them in this chamber and elsewhere. We will not vote for any of them.' This was read out to, obviously, some cheers from people present. I had to get up and point out that only two days before that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Costello, when addressing the National Press Club, said that if the opposition was elected to government next year it would not repeal any of those tax increases. Talk about rank hypocrisy! We have the opposition putting out a letter to several hundred thousand small businesses, beating its chest and saying, `We will oppose every one of these tax measures,' and then having to admit&mdash;in a different forum, of course, at the National Press Club&mdash;that once in government it would never repeal any of those tax measures that those opposite so vehemently oppose here. That is another side of the hypocrisy of the opposition: trying to play off different views and say one thing to one audience and something else to another audience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were quite a few dismayed looks among the small business community present when they found out the hypocrisy displayed by the Liberal Party in the letter from Mr Howard compared with the remarks by Mr Costello at the National Press Club. Let us deal with the remarks of the Prime Minister and his support for small business. The business community, big and small, leading up to the last budget insisted only one issue had to be dealt with above all others: get interest rates stable or get them down and have no more interest rate increases on the business community. </PARA>

In all of the budget discussions in which I was involved, the bottom line from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Finance Minister (Mr Beazley) was to get the deficit down and, if possible, get it into surplus.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. Who will be the biggest beneficiary from having interest rates remain stable or having them go down? It will be small business. Also, consumer confidence will increase. When consumer confidence increases, the biggest beneficiaries are small business. Overwhelmingly, people spend their money in small business&mdash;directly and indirectly. Interest rate stability means that not only direct investment improves but also consumer confidence improves. The bottom line is that, as small business improves, their turnover improves and their profit improves. That is what the bottom line of the budget was about. That is what we were doing to support small business. That is what they demanded we do, and we delivered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Although those opposite have not read the budget papers properly, they will note that the range of business assistance programs in the industry, science and technology portfolio and in the DEET portfolio were not affected. They were not cut back, as were programs in many other areas. Again, the government recognised that these programs are there to assist the growth of small business. A complete new program came through the DEET portfolio&mdash;$30 million over three years to fund enterprise development centres to encourage people to become self-employed and become operators of small business. Eighty enterprise development centres around Australia will be funded and will have access to funds to provide facilities to encourage small business development and expansion in their area. That was an absolutely new policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another successful program over the last four years has been the export access program. We have spent close to $20 million over the last four to five years in helping small business become export oriented. Other 1,000 firms have gone through that program, and nearly 90 per cent of them have an export order. The interesting part of that program is that, though we fund it, it is administered and operated by business industry groups and business associations. They were very strong in their support for continuing that program. We have continued funding for another four years. Another $14 million will be available over four years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export access program has proved very successful and is supported by the business community, which manages the scheme. It has been very successful in getting many small businesses into the export market. That program was supported in this budget. For the opposition to say that the Prime Minister is not interested in small business is an outright lie. He set the parameters for this budget to get the deficit down and to take the pressure off interest rates. The business enterprise programs were basically left untouched. I again ask the opposition: what are you going to do for small business? What are your election promises? What are your policies? You do not have one in any of these areas. You get up and mouth rhetoric and make personal attacks on the Prime Minister of the most outrageous and slanderous kind all over the country, yet you do not put up one idea to help small business. For that, you should be eternally ashamed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ALP's contempt for small business is a matter of the greatest public importance. The statement by Mr Keating to which my colleague Senator Campbell has referred is one of the most appalling statements I have ever heard in relation to one of the most dynamic sectors of our economy. The Prime Minister said in relation to small business:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it's never going to get any better. I mean, this is as good as it ever gets.</PARA>
<PARA>If it was not already destroyed, that statement has completely wiped out any support the Labor Party could ever expect from small business.

They know the reaction from small business in their electorates will be that they will never vote for the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's contempt for small business has been evident throughout its period in office. Labor was responsible for the worst recession in 60 years which wiped out small businesses by the thousands. That was preceded by the highest interest rates that this country has ever seen. Everybody knows that interest rates hit small businesses particularly badly. Labor's record in office has been one of destruction for the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor government has been responsible for introducing, in ways that have been very damaging to small business, the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax, the training guarantee levy and the maintenance of one of the worst industrial relations systems in the Western world. Senator Schacht said that we do not have any policies. In the industrial relations area, small business know what we are promising and what our policy is. So does the government. The government spends most of its time attacking our industrial relations policy. They attack us for not having a policy, and they then attack us because of our IR policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite are a bunch of hypocrites whose messages are completely contradictory and are not believed by small business. Small business will vote for us on the basis of our industrial relations policy. We recognise the problems small business faces in these areas and have clear positions in relation to the amelioration of the effects of the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. We have industrial relations policies in relation to small business. Despite the bluster of Senator Schacht, people know that we are on record with policies which will help small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995 budget is a classic reflection of Labor Party hostility to the small business sector. It is evident in many things. There is a nine per cent increase in the rate of company tax&mdash;many of these companies are small businesses&mdash;and a 33 per cent increase in the rate of tax on cars, which obviously will affect small business very badly. There is also the maintenance of the eight per cent provisional tax uplift factor. That is more than twice the rate of inflation and will hit small businesses in particular. There is an 80 per cent reduction in the threshold level for remitting PAYE tax on a twice-monthly basis. That threshold has been lowered from a remittance of $5 million to $1 million. A huge net of small businesses will be swept up in that difficult law. The budget will force a lot of subcontractors into the PAYE tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget, as has been confirmed by many commentators, will do very little to reduce the upward pressure on interest rates, the great killer of small businesses. This budget has been a complete blind; the underlying budget deficit is still enormously high and there is no activity on the fiscal front to bring about, through this budget, a sustained reduction in pressures on interest rates. That is bad news for small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the worst things that has occurred in this budget is the 12 per cent sales tax that has been applied to builders hardware and building materials. The budget says that sales tax will apply to presently exempt goods such as screws, nails, paint, putty, adhesives, wallpaper, ceramic and glass, floor and wall tiles, and so on. A whole range of goods which previously have been tax exempt are now going to be taxed at the 12 per cent rate. This is nothing more than a GST by stealth but, unlike the GST we promised at the last election, there is absolutely no compensation for this 12 per cent tax. The government is clearly engaged in the gradual expansion of the sales tax net. You can bet your bottom dollar that if this government were to remain in office&mdash;which, fortunately, is not going to happen&mdash;it would inevitably extend the range of items to which this sales tax would apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sales tax is very regressive because it will hit young first home buyers the most. They will be the worst affected. The HIA estimates that this tax is going to add $1,000 to the price of an $80,000 home, 2 1/2 times the estimate the government has put on it. It must mean that fewer houses are going to be built and there will be far fewer renovations, which is a massive industry. There will be reduced income in the housing industry and more job losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of this matter of public importance, we must remember that housing is very much a small business industry. New dwellings, renovations and so on are overwhelmingly the activity of small businesses. There are painters, carpenters, plumbers, electricians, contractors for roofing and so on. They are all small business men and women. The HIA estimates that 86 per cent of its 28,000 members are small businesses and three-quarters of new houses are built by small businesses. This is very much a small business industry which the government is hitting with the new 12 per cent GST by stealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The housing industry is already in decline, so on top of this tax, which will depress the industry further, there is clear evidence that this industry is on a downward spiral. Lending for housing has been falling every month since October. In February, it fell 26 per cent on the year before. Dwelling approvals are declining and have declined every month since November. They were down 23.9 per cent in April. So the statement by Mr Keating&mdash;or Dr Keating, as he now is&mdash;on small business, saying that they have `never had it so good', really sums up Labor's contempt for the huge range of small businesses in this country. I think it is Dr Keating's political suicide note. The small business sector of this country will completely reject him, his policies and his government when we vote in the federal election. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating's failure to appreciate that the success of small business is critical to the social and economic well-being of all Australians as demonstrated by his arrogant remarks and high taxing.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to see that this topic of small business has been raised yet again. I take it as a sign that, after much prompting, the coalition will finally support the Australian Democrats in our efforts to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. For years the artificial inflation of this uplift factor has been a sneaky slug on small businesses. Coalition support for our proposal will have more practical benefit for those businesses than yet more talk and hot air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business is the lifeblood of the Australian economy. Its role as an employer and a provider of goods and services cannot be underestimated. Over 850,000 small businesses employ over three million Australians. Given that importance, it is sad that our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) treats the difficulties faced by those trying to run small businesses with disdain, as evidenced by his comments that `this is as good as it gets' and `Go and get a PAYE job if you can't take the heat.' This disdain, unfortunately, also flowed through to the government's budget. Instead of giving the small business people of Australia a helping hand, the budget delivered yet more slugs to this embattled sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rises in car sales tax and the fringe benefits tax hit on cars are two obvious examples. When people think of Australia's car industry, it is easy to just think of the big players: Ford, GMH, Toyota and Mitsubishi. But these taxes will also hit many small businesses. There are  more than 140 small firms, employing over 30,000 people, which provide components to the car industry. Many more small businesses, in turn, are dependent on them. To hit the car industry is to hit all these firms spread over about 11 industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timing is appalling. I am not just referring to the yen crisis and the United States-Japan trade war. Just this week, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> cover story was entitled `Death of the Australian Car: Cheap Imports and Tariff Cuts Kill Off Local Industry'. For the first time this year, over half of the cars being sold are imports. Many are from Korea. A few years ago, fewer than 20 per cent of them were imports. In 1990, Korea exported only 7,000 cars to Australia. This year, the number will be over 70,000. Imports are up 35 per cent, while domestic sales are down 16 per cent. Our automotive trade deficit is running at over $7 billion per year&mdash;a 90 per cent deterioration over the last three years. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a figure for the trade deficit. It takes exports as well as imports into account. The difference between imports and exports is $7 billion per year. How does our government react to this crisis in the car industry, a crisis which could see the loss of all our major manufacturers along with the businesses and jobs which rely on them? Do we recognise that countries like Korea continue to protect their own markets? I note that Korea imported fewer than 4,000 vehicles for a market twice the size of Australia's last year while we imported 300,000 vehicles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recognising that our competitors still will not let our product in, how does our government react? Does it freeze tariffs to help those small businesses and jobs that depend on the car industry? No, it whacks the industry with more taxes. And it is not only the suppliers of our industry which will be hurt. Most of the cars still manufactured in Australia are at the larger end of the market. Over 50 per cent of these vehicles end up purchased for business use. All of those small businesses will be paying $1,000 per vehicle more as a result of this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a previous debate in this chamber, I detailed some other areas of concern for small business. The government had previously reduced the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent with a trade-off of a massive carry forward of tax payment instalments. Instalments now often fall due even before the money is earned. The tax is going up to 36 per cent and it will fall on small businesses as much as on big businesses, but the instalments are still early. Certainly it is not a fair deal for small business and the budget will be a major impost. The Australian Democrats will be looking carefully at these measures to see what can be done to relieve small business from this new low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of PAYE tax collection, currently, small business is not required to pay its tax instalments fortnightly because the threshold for this very costly and time consuming remittance is a salary bill of $5 million. That is being reduced to $1 million as a one-off revenue gain. Clearly, that new low threshold will dramatically increase compliance costs for many small businesses, despite the fact that the government concedes that tax compliance costs for small business are already five to 10 times higher than for big business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the building industry another election commitment was broken with some building materials now being taxable. This will increase the price of an average home by between $1,000 and $1,500, possibly more when the Australian Taxation Office finally clarifies what it means by saying it will be taxing items such as kitchen cupboards. Some materials will be tax exempt; some wholesalers will have to divide up building costs into taxable and non-taxable components, adding once again to compliance costs. This slug on building is on top of the three per cent rise in interest rates and the reduction of funding for public housing commencements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of finance for small business, in 1993 the government agreed to pay the banks $160 million in interest on statutory deposits with the proviso that it was used for small business lending. The Reserve Bank's annual report last year showed that small business is still treated unfavourably by the banks, facing interest rates up to three or four per cent higher than those of big business as well as higher security requirements. Despite this finding and the fact that surveys show that over 30 per cent of small businesses are constrained by lack of finance, the money is being taken back. It is highly likely that the banks will pass that $160 million on to small business consumers with even higher margins than they are suffering now&mdash;yet another slug on small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this, our Prime Minister tells us, is as good as it gets for small business. At this rate, in a few years the only small businesses left in Australia will be the ones that started out as big businesses. </PARA>

Yet in his very speech he said that there are over 850,000 small businesses employing three million people. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like to ask Senator Spindler: if the policies of the government have been so bad, how is it that we now have up towards one million small businesses employing three million people? It seems extraordinary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Spindler said that we ought to give small business a better go. Of course everybody wants to give small business a better go, but Senator Spindler himself would like to put more restrictions on some small businesses. For example, would Senator Spindler impose further burdens on small suburban solicitors, some of whom struggle to make $20,000 a year? So when we talk about small business, do we mean the whole range of small business? Or do we mean only those sorts of small businesses that we might favour, such as builders?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise that in that context to just show that this is a very interesting debate indeed. It is not a debate about policies, as pointed out, and I do not think it has ever pretended to be a debate about policies. This is not a situation where we come before your good self, Mr Acting Deputy President, who have so outstandingly filled the seat you now do for some years, and discuss what we can do for small business. That is not what this debate is about at all. This debate is about what this chamber normally is about and that is point scoring and that is what we as politicians must go in for as part of the trade, as it were. It is not a debate about whether or not we can help small businesses, or what policies can be brought forward as we meet here today to talk about that. </PARA>

That is the sort of proposition he will put. He will say the Prime Minister is a terrible person, Senator Schacht is a terrible person and the Australian Labor Party is a terrible party.

Senator Cooney, the thing with the Labor Party is that your people, your ministers and your front bench do not understand small business. They have no feel for it. They really do not appreciate what it is all about. There is an arrogance in your government and in the ministers who control it that is almost the death knell of small business in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of Senator Calvert's constituents said, `The recession was much better than the recovery.' That is what most small business people are saying. Mr Keating is telling small business people that they should go back to PAYE employment. The arrogance of this government is made worse by the appointment of the supposed Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht. What was he before he came here? He would not have had a clue about small business. All he ever did as a union organiser and as a Labor Party official was to try to drag small business down and put it into the gutter. That is the man who is now supposed to be running small business in this country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Schacht said, in his incompetent way, that the average increase in the cost of building a house would be between $400 and $600, people at that seminar told him that from their estimates&mdash;and they had done their figures&mdash;the cost of building would go up between $1,200 and $2,000. Another person at that meeting had a quantity surveyor get some results for his particular business. The quantity surveyor told this small businessman, a cabinet-maker, that the sales tax increase will add 2.5 per cent to three per cent to the cost of a home. It does not matter whether it is an average home, a big home or a little home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That cabinet-maker informed me that the average cost of a prefabricated kitchen in Townsville is $5,000. His turnover is $2 million, and in the whole of Townsville&mdash;this is just one city&mdash;the sale of prefabricated kitchens each year is worth about $25 million to $30 million. Therefore, in Townsville, one community alone, the tax hike on prefabricated kitchens will be about $3.6 million. As my colleagues have said, the MBA and the HIA estimate that the 12 per cent increase will bring in $523 million per year, not the $250 million calculated by Mr Willis.

It does so by tackling a major constraint to growth&mdash;our low level of national savings. This has been done by reducing government spending and promoting private savings through employee contributions to superannuation. Superannuation funds will reduce our dependence on foreign capital.

It is typical of the `short-termism' of the opposition. It has not introduced policies that indicate to the Australian people what it will do in government. It is hiding those from the people, because the last time it divulged its policies it got a hiding.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Schacht has pointed out, the message from small business is to keep interest rates low. When faced with a choice of interest rate rises or moderate tax increases, this government listened to small business and kept interest rates low.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that our Prime Minister does not like to read. Perhaps one of his staff will brief him on this chapter. It would enlighten him as to the representative nature of the Senate. The chapter shows that in a House of Representatives election the imbalance between percentage of votes and seats is most marked in what is known as a landslide victory. For example, in 1958 the ALP received 42.8 per cent of the vote in the Senate election and 42.9 per cent in the House of Representatives election. In that election the ALP secured 46.9 per cent of Senate places at issue, but only 37.9 per cent of the House of Representatives seats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an interesting paragraph which shows how, over a considerable period of time, the Senate, with its voting system, which is a complex system, has often been able to demonstrate that it is a more representative chamber than the lower house. I quote from chapter one of the 7th edition:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very clear example of the capacity of the Senate system to improve representation in the Commonwealth Parliament is party representation of Tasmanians in the period from the simultaneous dissolutions of 1975 to the general election for the House and the Senate in 1987. In this period, notwithstanding a party share of the vote of from 40.3 per cent (1983) to 45.1 per cent (1980), no candidate endorsed by the Australian Labor Party for a House seat was successful.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Labor Party obtained between 40 and 43 per cent of the vote but in the state of Tasmania it did not get one House of Representatives seat. I continue quoting:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And prime ministers? I do not know that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is going to shell out 50 bucks for a copy. I do not want to be diverted. The first chapter is very important because it establishes not only the background to the existence of the Senate but also the exposition of its functions as well as the role that senators have to play. It deals with the Senate in a bicameral and federalist system. It establishes the basis of both houses of parliament. It deals with the rationale of bicameralism. Interestingly enough, that was a discussion that we had around the dinner table on Saturday night or last night. Whichever night it was, it was one of those discussions which took place. People in the Northern Territory would wish that they had a bicameral system so that more mature consideration could have been given to that tragic decision of the unicameral parliament in that territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chapter provides the rationale of federalism. As Senator Kemp indicated, it deals with the representation in the Senate and how, on occasions, it lends succour to one party or the other which is absolutely obliterated in the House of Representatives. I wonder whether the Prime Minister would have described this chamber as unrepresentative swill when Tasmania did not return one Labor Party member to the lower house but returned five or six to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chapter deals with the functions of the Senate and its powers. That is something which is not very often understood by the public nor by those from whom the public obtains much of its political information, namely, the press. There are notable exceptions in the press who do know and understand the functions and legislative powers of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of casual vacancies is dealt with in that chapter. It regularly amuses me how the casual vacancy provisions arose. I was on the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters when that recommendation was made. I was not dreadfully supportive of it because it required me to make myself a party, which was somewhat difficult. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will remember that. </PARA>

Ultimately, I think one or maybe two were guillotined and one was stabbed in the bath. I hope I will not be one of the latter. I digress, but he did say that, if you have the other member of the committee in your pocket, you can afford to appoint your worst enemy to the committee. I did not take that advice either. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many people who are keen political commentators say that a good politician always has a good spouse. However, there is something that good senators need; that is, a good copy of Odgers. In fact, I had cause to consult the latest edition of Odgers only today when I received a letter from a barrister asking for the identity of the source of information which I had received which was confidential. Needless to say, I was a little reluctant to provide to somebody who was involved in what I thought may well have been a witch-hunt the details of a confidential source of information which I had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing I did was consult Odgers, for the purpose of ascertaining my entitlement to tell this person that I did not intend to give them the identity of my informant. Odgers, of course, was to the point in dealing with the issue of parliamentary privilege and parliamentary immunity. I had great pleasure in writing back that, in relation to my sources of information, both inside and outside this organisation, on which he was conducting the inquiry, he was referred to the privileges pertaining to senators which are contained in section 49 of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make that point because it is important to understand how valuable a reference material Odgers is. I congratulate the Clerk of the Senate and those who work with him for the work which has gone into updating Odgers, through both the 6th and now the 7th edition. As practice in the chamber changes&mdash;and there have been many changes to the standing orders&mdash;it is important that we as senators have a reference source which is up-to-date, precise and easy to use. One of the joys about Odgers&mdash;I do not know how it was achieved&mdash;is that it is actually shorter than the previous edition. That means that it is more succinct, but as a reference it is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember numerous occasions prior to the last election when the government had us sitting at all hours of the evening and morning. It was important to look at issues of procedure, particularly when the government had the intention of having a rolling guillotine, and the most valuable reference material that I had and many others on this side of the chamber had&mdash;and I know Senator Kemp was one of those&mdash;was Odgers. You could go to it and see exactly what the precedents were for all sorts of things, and it would provide a clear and rational way to go forward and to deal with matters of importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine made a good point as well. He said, and I agree, that maybe the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) ought to invest in a copy of Odgers to see how important the Senate is. I facetiously said that maybe we ought to have a whip around for him. I think there are many people, certainly on my side of the chamber, who would not feed him, let alone fork out to buy him a copy of Odgers. It may well be that the elucidation contained in Odgers and the refinement of the Senate chamber would be beyond the ken of our current Prime Minister anyway, so I suppose one could forgive the pun `there is no point in throwing pearls at swine'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the document itself is also important because it provides an understanding for those who are not members of the Senate as to how the system works. Frequently, people who are guests of parliament say to me, `What's happening here?' or, `What's going to happen there?' School students in groups ask, `How did you get from this to that?' The mechanisms by which we deal with business in the Senate are well known to us but they are a mystery to people outside the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the values of this text is that anybody could pick it up&mdash;it is clear; it is precise&mdash;and get an understanding. The sad thing is that for so many years there was a group in this Senate that was opposed to the publication of Odgers. What is the purpose of opposing a publication such as this? The point of Odgers was to make the practice of the Senate clear for anybody who was interested. It is important that that is achieved. Otherwise, the mechanisms of government and the people who are governed drift further and further apart, or at least their understanding does. Surely, we ought to be encouraging people to take a greater interest in what happens in parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time I address a school group, whether it is here or back in Queensland or elsewhere, I always make the point that we cannot expect to have good parliamentarians, be they senators or members, unless we have interested voters&mdash;people who take an interest in what is happening and have an understanding. Ill-informed voters lead to ill-informed decisions as to who ultimately becomes the representative body of the people of Australia. If people understand what happens in the Senate, understand the importance of this institution, understand the importance of having a forum where differing views can be presented other than in the other place&mdash;which is after all merely the electoral college of the government&mdash;people will realise that the Senate is not just a cherished institution to those of us who have the honour and the privilege of serving in it, but it should be a cherished institution of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said in a debate a couple of weeks ago that there were many occasions on which I have disagreed with Senator Chamarette. But she and I agree on one thing, which is that ordinary members of the Senate ought to have a right to express an opinion because we represent a viewpoint in the community. Would it not be sad if those who wanted to abolish the Senate had their way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was discussing this point with a number of English friends of mine the other week, and I pointed out the Prime Minister's long-held view that the Senate was an irrelevancy. They were perturbed at the suggestion that any sane person would want to do away with the upper house, and I said that that is the intention of the Prime Minister. The reason why they expressed outrage and indignation that a government in this day and age would seek to do away with the second chamber was that they recognised the importance of it. They said, `The only places in the modern world that have unicameral government are Third World dictatorships.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They said, `Whatever you do, don't go down that road.' I know that economically we might qualify as a Third World country but some of us still cherish the fact that there is a concept in this country of free speech and that free speech gets its finest parliamentary expression in this chamber rather than in the other place. These people&mdash;they were bankers&mdash;said that abolition of the Senate would be a backward step because it would send the wrong signal to the business community as to what sort of government we ought to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think you can treat the parliament or the Senate in splendid isolation from the rest of the world. You cannot treat the Senate in isolation from the Australian community. You cannot treat the Senate in isolation from what happens in the business world. Everything that happens here has an impact outside these walls. I think those of us who serve here understand that. Maybe the understanding of those who serve down the other end is not as fine as ours is on these issues. Maybe that is the burden under which our Prime Minister labours. I think he labours under a number of other burdens as well but that is one of the burdens under which he labours.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a good reading of Odgers would do him an immense amount of good. I do not think it will help him win the next election; I think he has lost that already. But an understanding of what happens here is critical to the good governance of this nation. Therefore, I think this seventh edition of Odgers should be soundly commended by all senators on both sides of the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA>The national network of environmental lawyers, which is proposed in the justice statement, is a welcome first step in redressing the serious imbalance for community groups and individuals attempting to ensure protection of the environment through the legal system. Groups seeking legal advice, representation and litigation are often opposing interests that are extremely well resourced. New South Wales has the only full Environmental Defender's Office. Other states have very limited or no access and many groups and individuals rely on services provided by lawyers on a voluntary basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens were very pleased to note the scope for other initiatives to be used in the interests of the environment. These include: increased funding for legal aid for civil matters; the provision of funding for civil litigation in the form of fees for barristers attached to community legal centres; the national test case funding; and the national disbursements fund.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that criteria for these measures include provision for environmental matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures, we believe, are an appropriate response to a strong and longstanding call from people all over Australia. Greater participation by the community in all aspects of decision making is of benefit for all in the community and for the government. However, the proposed funding for the national network is inadequate. It is not appropriate, in our view, for the government to provide minimal funding and rely so heavily on the goodwill of people committed to environmental justice to provide the remaining services for the public good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has proposed a national network but it did not provide funding for national coordination as requested by the New South Wales Environmental Defender's Office. This organisation has in effect been acting as a national coordinating body for some years. In its submission to Access to Justice the New South Wales Environmental Defender's Office did not apply for increased funding for itself but did request funding to allow it to continue its existing national liaison and to coordinate this new national network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This coordination is vital to ensure maximum benefit from limited resources, to avoid duplication of effort and to encourage communication. It will allow very valuable exchange of information on cases and precedents and provides support from others working in similar areas and under similar circumstances with equally limited resources. I believe it will be a first step to avoid unnecessary duplication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some funding available for two community development officers. It is expected that they will play a coordinating role in relation to community legal centres. However, it is important that the national environmental law network is coordinated separately and is done by somebody with the necessary expertise in this area. I urge the government to correct this oversight and make the requested funding available to ensure proper coordination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also announced in the Justice Statement that the human rights and discrimination law centre would be established. The first task of the centre is to conduct a review of discrimination on the grounds of sexuality. This is a welcome move. However, it is still a second best process. The lesbian, gay and transgender community has been calling for a full review of discrimination by the Australian Law Reform Commission. Such a review would enable a comprehensive inquiry process to be established and would facilitate debate within the wider community about changes to the law. This is a very wide-ranging area of the law. The recent Law Reform Commission inquiry into equality before the law cost in the vicinity of $500,000. It is my understanding that the law centre review is to receive only $50,000. This shows a clear lack of commitment to ending discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I have no reason to believe that the outcomes of the law centre's review will be deficient, obviously the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission carry substantial political weight. The continuation of discrimination against lesbians, gay men and transgenderists must be addressed. It is time to stop shying away from an open community debate. The Justice Statement provided a perfect opportunity to protect the rights of lesbians, gay men and transgenderists. The government has yet again baulked at the opportunity. Nonetheless, this statement includes much that will be welcomed by the community. It is regrettable that it seems to take a pre-election year to stimulate some of these measures when they may well have been called for a lot earlier. I commend these welcome initiatives and commend this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's Justice Statement, as presented to the President of the Senate on 17 May, announced a number of very positive initiatives. Amongst those were the creation of a network of environmental lawyers, measures to encourage the use of alternative dispute resolution, an allocation of funds to enable courts to develop charters setting out standards of efficiency and service, and an increase in the Commonwealth's contribution to legal aid. However, it should be said that this increase will not be enough to make up for the gradual decline in legal aid over the past five years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from these and some other positive initiatives, the Justice Statement has failed to tackle a number of hard issues. The first and most serious was its failure to make substantive reforms to the legal profession. Aside from allowing lawyers to advertise&mdash;an option that not many are taking up&mdash;the statement made little more than an airy commitment to making the legal profession more competitive or accountable to the public. Yet a key reason for the high cost of justice in this country is the inability of lawyers to regulate themselves properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the legal profession controls the number of entrants into its market by determining who shall receive articles of clerkship or, in the case of college of law graduates, who shall fulfil the minimal employment requirements. These are needed before a law graduate is granted a full practising certificate. Thus, it is lawyers who determine how many lawyers there are. The conflict of interest is obvious, yet the Justice Statement did not even mention it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Justice Statement also did nothing to provide an independent complaints system against lawyers. Presently, lawyers are responsible for administering complaints against other lawyers in nearly all states. Once more, the conflict of interest is clear. The government fudged these issues by saying that it did not have the constitutional power to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats do not agree; the government does have jurisdiction to create an individual complaints mechanism for lawyers operating in both the Family Court and Federal Court and a similar power with respect to moneys in trust for federal matters. These would have been sound measures in their own right but also they would have established strong precedents for state governments to follow. Further, the government has obviously plenty of influence given that it provides a very significant proportion of legal aid to the states; sometimes over half of state legal aid is Commonwealth sourced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another shortcoming in the Justice Statement is the government's failure to commit itself to putting all Commonwealth laws and regulations, the constitution and parliamentary debates on the Internet. The Democrats believe that the wide availability of information about our laws and system of government is absolutely essential, particularly at a time when smaller public libraries around the country are being closed in the name of economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned before, the network of environmental lawyers is excellent. However, the government has done nothing to address the fact that legal aid is only available for environmental disputes in two states. As has been mentioned by Senator Chamarette, no funds have been allocated for the national coordination of the network of environmental lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the legal aid for environmental cases, at the moment a branch of the Attorney-General's Department determines when and how much money shall be granted for test cases in this area. In cases where the government is a litigant, such as the guns/woodchip licence challenge, the potential for conflict of interest is obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are also concerned about the government's promise to consult before statutory rules and regulations are created where those regulations affect business and business only. It neglected to mention that in so doing it was specifically rejecting a recommendation of the Administrative Review Council that consultation occur in the drafting of all statutory regulations except in limited circumstances. The government is therefore declaring that regulations that affect business are worthy of consultation but those that affect, for example, immigration, defence, child support and food standards are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further criticism is that the Justice Statement made no reference to prison reform. This is despite the fact that Australian prisons are now little more than holding pens. Tied grants should have been targeted towards prison officer training, rehabilitation programs, halfway houses and other infrastructure such as libraries. Given that two-thirds of prisoners in this country are likely to re-offend, the idea of a safer Australia without prison reform is ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The human rights research law centre is to be established and that is welcome. However, the amount of $50,000 that has been allocated for the inquiry into the discrimination suffered by gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people is hopelessly inadequate. One would have thought that at this stage the government would have seen the importance of this issue and allocated funds which would have given this particular inquiry a reasonable chance of success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other issue should be mentioned. In respect to the measures foreshadowed for family law reform, care must be taken in an attempt to produce more equitable results. Changes to the law and property division must be based not only on contributions made to a marriage but also on future needs of the separating partners. That needs a lot more emphasis in the legislation that is now before us. In particular, the responsibilities of primary care givers must be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, while many features of the Justice Statement are worthwhile and deserve praise and support, the statement could have been a lot better. In particular, it could have taken on the privileged profession that has given us so many politicians. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>In particular, I note recommendation No. 1 by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which, as I understand it, was unanimous. That recommendation was to increase the effect of power of the legislature of this house and the other place. It recommended in that instance that the resources available to the legislature be substantially increased so that, among other things, it can better assess the impact of legislation and its committees can better function. The committee went further and said that the parties in parliament should be given greater resources to better carry out their work of dealing with legislation and that parliamentary committees should be provided with sufficient staff to let them carry out more extensive work than they are presently able to. That is a most pertinent matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recently seen funding to the Senate standing committees and select committees slashed in the order of 37 per cent. The legal and constitutional affairs committee&mdash;I deal with both the legislation committee and the references committee&mdash;has had its funding cut in half. This unanimous recommendation from the committee, which was looking at the cost of justice and matters attendant thereto, was concerned that legislation was going through the parliament of Australia without adequate scrutiny and that part of this essential scrutiny is the Senate committee system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government response was that resource matters for parliamentary committees are for the parliament to decide. Remuneration issues for parliamentary office-holders are determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. That is not a response. The government is entirely shirking the issue by saying that resources are for the parliament to decide. In this instance, the government has slashed the funding available to be applied to the various committees. That is a very effective way of muzzling any input from the coalition, the minor parties and even from Senator Schacht's colleagues on his side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government fails to remember that there are occasions when the minister has asked for a bill to be referred to a Senate committee. So it is not just the coalition that the government says uses these committees to indulge in troublemaking; the other parties and the independents in this chamber have referred various bills to those committees as well, all for very good reason. The people of Australia, via the Senate committee system, can have better scrutiny of the legislation before this parliament. So it was that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended on a unanimous basis that there be better resources for these very important reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government simply said, `It is for parliament to decide what resources should be available.' I challenge the government to let parliament decide what amount should be  appropriated for Senate committees. Let us decide that. If, as it said in its response, it is for us to decide, why not leave that to the parliament, and we will make that necessary appropriation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government knows full well that that is not the case. The government has slashed the amount available by 37 per cent, or $250,000 in rough terms, as I recall. That is a very small amount when one looks at the entire budget. We did not see the government cutting back on government spending in other areas where it could have done so. We have not seen the government exercising some fiscal control there. But when it comes to the Senate committee system, which the government does not always get decisions from that it likes, it says that it is time to wield the block axe and slash funding. It is just not on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not part of the democratic process to have the Senate committee system muzzled in this way. A most effective way of encroaching on the democratic system in this country is to cut the funding for these Senate committees. The government said that it is for the parliament to decide. In this case, the parliament did not decide; the government made the determination that the funding be cut. That is no response to what the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee system is a very good system. The respective committees work very hard. Time and again, I have heard government members in this chamber praise that system and join in reports which have been by consensus and unanimous. The people of Australia do not realise that in the committee system there is a good deal of agreement and common purpose. It is a shame that the government has seen fit to cut funding in this way. Its response to this very matter is entirely deficient. </PARA>

It must, before committees and through other measures, attempt to get support for its legislation. The Senate has become a very real house of review through the Senate system. The government has now very obviously resorted to the tactic of withdrawing resources and starving Senate committees of the resources that they need to do the job properly. It is not a procedure worthy of the Australian parliament. In the Democrats' view, the government should certainly reconsider its position.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, let me put on my bipartisan hat and say that at last we are seeing something concrete from the government in response to the access to justice issue which, Mr Acting Deputy President, you will understand and which plenty of other senators, even those on the other side, will understand is an issue that was made a community issue by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. There is some debate about whether it was the now Acting Supreme Court Judge Spender QC or Don Chipp who first raised this matter, but it certainly was not a member of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter was taken up by the parliamentary committee system, a system that is now having its resources trimmed. As soon as it became an issue in the community, as a result of the Senate addressing an issue of community concern, the Labor Attorney-General picked it up and said, with his hand over his heart, that he had always been concerned about it. Out came this big Justice Statement, for which many trees were cut down. While I do not deny that the statement contains some good things, if it represents the creative capacity of this government to address this issue, we are in for big trouble. There is no creativity and no innovation in this Justice Statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to refer to the number of re-announcements. I may not get through them all in time. This is meant to be the new direction forward but a good part of it simply looks back and announces what has already been done. It announces the introduction of legislation for greater certainty and fairness in the division of matrimonial property&mdash;first announced in December 1993. It announces the referral of powers from states in relation to de facto arrangements&mdash;also announced in 1993. It announces a competition policy to apply to the legal profession&mdash;already before the parliament and long ago agreed. It announces the establishment of a small taxation claims tribunal&mdash;a bill for which is already in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is corporate law simplification. That was a big announcement. We are already dealing with the first bill and other exposure drafts are already around. It announces a general commitment to simplifying laws. We have been on about plain English simplification of law for the 10 years I have been in the parliament. There is nothing new there. It announces a commitment to a legislative instruments bill. Forgive me, but I think that has already been through this chamber. It announces a model criminal code. We have been talking about that for 10 years and the first bill has already been through this chamber. Then there are the federal evidence laws, bills for which have already been through this chamber and the forensic procedures bill&mdash;the exposure draft for which is already out and being discussed in public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say anything for or against the substantive matters; I simply indicate that those are just the start of the re-announcements in this justice package. There is very little in here that is new. What is new is a lot more money for consultants, researchers, advisers. All those people will have jobs and will have no trouble gaining access to justice because they will be on good salaries. In the next couple of days I expect to see the Attorney-General's Department advertising 12 or 13 new positions to administer these new programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most creative inquiries will be into the causes of crime. I wonder how many such inquiries there have been and why we suddenly feel we need a new one. It really highlights the barrenness of this government's capacity to deal with this issue. It also highlights its preparedness to go into flash packaging jobs&mdash;waving around a Justice Statement which it knows people will not have the time to read every page of&mdash;as a pre-election gimmick. When you take it apart and find all the re-announcements you cannot feel proud of what has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some half measures. There is an enormous list of reviews and pilot programs which simply shows that the government is going to go on looking at problems without any idea of how to fix them. I intend to continue to push the point that while there are some, not many, good points in this statement, the best news is for bureaucrats, consultants and researchers. There is some good news for those people eligible for legal aid. But for the bulk of Australians, whose assets deprive them of access to legal aid and who are not as wealthy as some of the bankrupts that this government has let escape overseas, there is nothing. There is nothing here for the ordinary Australian who has a legal problem and who, because of a lack of finance, cannot access justice. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill reflects the continuing commitment of this government to securing legitimate title to traditional lands on behalf of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory referred to in schedule 1 of that act may be granted to Aboriginal land trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the act came into operation in 1977 a total of 59 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this bill would be to bring within the schedule to the Land Rights Act that area of land which is the subject of the Western Desert repeat land claim. The Northern Territory Government, the Central Land Council and claimants in the land claim have entered into an agreement which settles that land claim. As part of that agreement the Northern Territory Government agreed to request the Commonwealth to exercise its powers under the Land Rights Act to grant the claim area, excluding the Tanami Road, to the traditional owners by scheduling that area under the Land Rights Act. The result of such scheduling would be that no further hearing or report by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner would then be necessary in order for the Aboriginal people concerned to be able to have the full rights of enjoyment of their traditional lands in fee simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has the assurance of all parties to the negotiations that representative views of all Aboriginal people concerned have been obtained and their wishes taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no financial implications arising from this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed in the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1995 and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1995 will give effect to the national heavy vehicle charges developed by the independent National Road Transport Commission to apply to vehicles registered under the federal interstate registration scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Heads of government agreed in July 1991 to the establishment of the NRTC to develop nationally consistent charges and regulations for vehicles over 4.5 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRTC released its heavy vehicle charges determination in June 1992. The Road Transport Charges (ACT) Act which gives effect to the charges in the act from 1 July 1995 and sets the model for other jurisdictions received royal assent in May 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that inconsistent regulations and charges which continue to impede improvements in the efficiency of the road transport industry be changed to achieve a nationally uniform operating environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While agreement has been reached by state and territory ministers on the heavy vehicle charges, some states continue to be reluctant to implement them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments will mean that FIRS vehicles registered in states where national charges have not yet been introduced will have access to the national charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interests of achieving national uniformity FIRS will apply only to vehicles over 4.5 tonnes and charges will no longer be able to be paid by instalments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Money collected from these registration charges will continue to be returned to state and territory governments for the maintenance and upkeep of roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the provisions of the bill. The principal amendments will remove the option to pay a registration charge based on actual distance travelled and the option to pay registration charges by instalments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further amendments will remove the references to motor vehicle and trailer charge monitoring devices. At present these devices are used to determine the actual distance that a vehicle has travelled in order to calculate the actual distance amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that reliable distance-only measuring devices are not currently available in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes reflect the arrangements for registration charges determined through the NRTC process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequential amendments are required to the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985. The proposed amendments will include the registration charges for various vehicle types as a schedule to that act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implementation of national charges for heavy vehicles is a crucial step in the reform of the road transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments demonstrate the federal government's commitment to the harmonisation of heavy vehicle charges and regulations and its recognition of the importance of the road transport industry to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The onus is now on the states and the NT to act on their commitment to implement the charges from 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed in the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1995 will apply the national heavy vehicle registration charges developed by the National Road Transport Commission to vehicles registered under the federal interstate registration scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By implementing the national charges for vehicles registered under FIRS, the Commonwealth is honouring its commitment under the heavy vehicles agreement and promoting the harmonisation of road transport charges and regulations. This is important in facilitating efficiency improvements in the road transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the provisions of the bill. The principal amendment will provide the national registration charges developed through the NRTC process as a schedule to the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide that where a vehicle falls within two or more vehicle types for the purposes of the charges, the registration charge will be the higher or highest of the charges applicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments further provide that the amounts of registration charges may be altered by the regulations. Such an alteration must not increase or decrease the amount for the previous year by more than 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments are to come into force from 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net budgetary impact of the amendments will be nil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill should be read in conjunction with the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to make a number of amendments to Immigration and Ethnic Affairs portfolio legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the Migration Act 1958 give effect to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration&mdash;Report on Asylum, Border Control and Detention&mdash;temporarily extend the operation of the migration agents registration scheme, provide for changes to the incoming passenger card, and make other minor and technical amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint standing committee report made a number of recommendations regarding the release from detention of persons who arrive in Australia without authorisation. Amongst other aspects, the committee expressed concern&mdash;in recommendations 10 and 11&mdash;that there should be a capacity to consider release where detention exceeded six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the committee's recommendations have already been implemented. This bill implements the government's response to recommendations 10 and 11 by providing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs with a non-compellable discretion to determine that a person is an `eligible non-citizen'. Such persons are then able to apply for a bridging visa, which authorises their release from detention. The power to make the determination must be exercised by the Minister personally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister decides to exercise the power, the minister must table a statement in parliament setting out the determination and referring particularly to the reasons why the determination is in the public interest. Part 3 of the Migration Act 1958 provides a comprehensive registration scheme to regulate the conduct of migration agents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This part of the act is subject to a `sunset clause' whereby the registration scheme will cease in September 1995, after having operated for 3 years. The proposed one year extension of the scheme until September 1996 will allow the Government time to consider the forthcoming report on the scheme by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, and provide time for the passage of any legislative changes. The Committee's report is expected in June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 506 of the Migration Act 1958 stipulates that regulations are to provide for information to be given on a passenger card. Subsection 506(2) requires that all non-citizens travelling to Australia, unless exempted, must answer the questions on the passenger card. Subsection 506(3) requires that certain questions be included on the card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment to subsection 506(3) will allow greater flexibility with passenger cards, which will assist the streamlining of passenger entry into Australia. It will remove the present obligation to require all people completing the passenger card to answer questions relating to all the matters provided in subsection 506(3). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The adult migrant english program, AMEP, provides tuition in English as a second language to migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds. Tuition is provided to a functional level, sufficient to facilitate employment and achieve personal settlement goals. Current legislation requires the Commonwealth to provide free AMEP tuition to holders of certain types of visas. The amendment to the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 would exclude from that entitlement persons who hold permanent visas through having satisfied the principal applicant criteria for Class 816 or Class 818 entry permits&mdash;under the Migration (1993) Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 November 1993 the government announced changes to provide access to permanent residence to&mdash;amongst others&mdash;better qualified asylum-seekers; and persons who held, or were eligible for, concessional entry permits providing humanitarian extensions of stay for people from Sri Lanka and the former Yugoslavia; and certain persons who held higher education qualifications, or had undertaken study towards them. Such persons could apply for Class 816 or 818 entry permits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When approving the introduction of the new classes, the government considered that principal applicants would either need to demonstrate a capacity to communicate in English, or have English language proficiency sufficient to have undertaken or completed studies in Australia. Those persons should have no need to access the AMEP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will exclude those seeking access, and discontinue access to those already receiving tuition. Departmental records at early May show that of almost 6,000 principal applicants approved so far, around 400 persons have accessed the AMEP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Migration (Delayed Visa Applications) Tax Act 1992 was introduced at the same time as the Migration Reform Act 1992, as part of a package of measures designed to improve the effectiveness of Australia's control of its borders and the regulation of the entry, detention and removal of people who have no entitlement to remain. It was intended that the tax&mdash;payable by certain persons who obtain a visa after being unlawfully in Australia&mdash;would act as a disincentive to people remaining unlawful for long periods. The legislation was not intended to raise revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's view that the objectives of the Migration (Delayed Visa Applications) Tax Act 1992 are being effectively achieved through other legislative and procedural mechanisms. Since the introduction of the Migration Reform Act 1992, very limited classes of visas can be granted to persons unlawfully in Australia when they apply. Unlawful non-citizens face mandatory detention and removal by force of law, and bear the responsibility for associated costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other initiatives implemented in the Migration Reform Act 1992 have progressed and streamlined compliance mechanisms. Additionally, increased investment in the compliance area has resulted in a significant improvement in a number of key indicators of compliance with migration laws. Against this background, the objectives of the Migration (Delayed Visa Applications) Tax Act 1992 are no longer regarded as necessary for the successful achievement of compliance strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Repeal of that tax act is proposed with retrospective effect to the date of its commencement. The numbers of applicants liable for the tax are few. Retrospective repeal would ensure that no persons would be liable for the tax, and is considered the most equitable course of action. It is proposed that any debts payable under the act be extinguished, and that a refund provision be provided. The projected revenue loss is negligible. I commend this bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Debate (on motion by <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Calvert</EMPHASIS>) adjourned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 and Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1995 be listed as separate orders of the day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst speaking to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1995, I take this opportunity to make some general comments about the integrity of the system we have operating in Australia. This legislation adopts recommendations from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters relating to public funding for election campaigns. Having been involved in a number of campaigns, I am only too well aware of their costs. I have been the campaign director in a federal electorate for four federal election campaigns. I have been the state campaign director for two electoral campaigns. I do have an understanding of the complexities required to recoup some of those electoral costs. Having said that, I believe the same level of scrutiny does not apply to the integrity of the rolls. I understand Senator Tierney and others have made comments about this issue previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have raised this matter before, particularly after the last federal election when there were a number of concerns about the legitimacy of some people claiming to be on the electoral roll for certain seats. The electoral commissioner has assured me that they do all things necessary to ensure the purity and accuracy of the rolls. However, I would like to tell two stories that suggest this accuracy is not all that it might be. For obvious reasons the names of the people involved in this exercise will remain unknown. For an election, a person whom we shall call Nigel Nichol Langford Black was registered to vote. His occupation was listed as leading hand. His address was given, and it was accurate&mdash;as was his name and occupation. For the same election, I understand a Samuel Bach was registered to vote. His name and address were also accurate. Neither Nigel Black nor Samuel Bach voted at that particular election. There is a very good reason for their not doing so. Nigel Black is a donkey, and Sam Bach is a dog. There was no difficulty in getting those names onto the electoral roll. It would have been very easy for persons claiming to be Nigel Black and Sam Bach to have turned up and voted. Most probably they could have voted five or six times at different polling places. Similarly, there was little to stop someone claiming to have either of those two names voting hundreds of times at different places around the electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I gave notice of a motion concerning the very fast train project that was on the national agenda from the late 1980s until the early 1990s. It was first talked about seriously in about 1989. Since the early 1990s, it has silently slipped off the agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CX5">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it has. The very fast train was to have run between Sydney and Melbourne on an especially designed track. Travelling at speeds of 350 kilometres an hour it would have been the fastest train in the world. The Sydney-Melbourne journey would have taken just three hours. It was expected that 30 trains a day would run each way. It was going to be an extraordinarily effective people mover at a very reasonable cost to the users of the service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project was to have been built by a consortium that included some of Australia's biggest companies: BHP; Elders; TNT; and the Japanese construction company Kumagai Gumi. The VFT project would have been the biggest project since the Snowy Mountains development and one of the most impressive projects since the Second World War. Construction of the VFT would have had an economic impact in the same manner as any major construction has; that is, a direct demand for labour and materials and a flow-on in indirect activity. Operation of the VFT would have supported direct economic activity along the route associated with the train's operations and track, and rolling stock maintenance. There would also have been indirect impacts, for instance, by changing the pattern of geographic accessibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The VFT has the potential to affect decisions on industrial location, residential location and market size across a range of economic sectors. Tourism, especially with the Olympic Games only 4 1/2 years away, would have been a great winner by increasing access to activities along the route. North-eastern Victoria would have greatly benefited from the original proposals, most noticeably the snow fields, wineries and water-based recreation activities around Lake Eildon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this would have come to pass if more imagination and commitment had been shown by the federal Labor government. The project was killed because the federal government refused to consider tax breaks for the developers. They wanted no financial assistance&mdash;having done their sums&mdash;except that they considered that tax holidays or concessions were needed. It was, and potentially still is, a very impressive project which would have very great benefits for us in terms of the tyranny of distance and linking our major capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the 1993 election, the coalition offered tax concessions to ensure that this valuable project would go ahead. I feel very strongly that, with the Olympics and the turn of the century just 4 1/2 years away, it should be placed back on the public agenda because an efficient national transport system is essential to ferry between Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra the hundreds of thousands of domestic and international visitors who will come for the Olympics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a scheme that should still be seen as a national project. It should be embraced, as was the Snowy Mountains scheme, as being of long-term benefit to Australia. The Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure tabled a report in March 1991 on the proposed VFT project. The question, from the consortium's point of view, of financing the project came before the committee. The groups involved clearly said that it was a private project and they were not looking for government funding. However, the issue of incentive by way of tax arrangements was raised. At the time, committee member Senator Margaret Reid raised the prospect of the government's looking at whether or not tax incentives or tax arrangements ought to be put in place to ensure the project went ahead. That did not specifically favour a particular national project, but any project of this kind which was clearly in the national interest, as this one would be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal cabinet, under Bob Hawke, supported the project but failed to deliver when it came to providing a reasonable economic environment for such a project to proceed. Some doubt was expressed as to whether Australia had sufficient population to generate the number of passengers to provide sufficient revenue to make the project profitable for investors. I believe there would be enough passengers to make it profitable; and the projections show that would be the case. I have no doubt that in the future, as our population grows, we will have sufficient population to make this project even more profitable. In terms of national infrastructure, it would be well worth getting the project off the ground now so it is in place as the population increases and economic activity develops. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am advised by the Australian Customs Service that no official record exists of D-Ram Pty Ltd of Queensland importing a sample unit of an Air Taser stun gun. Nor has an import approval been sought of ACS by the company in question. Following inquiries in Queensland, my advice is that no product samples have been shown to Government officials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) As part of the Government's response to the recommendations of the National Committee on Violence Report 1990, there has been considerable attention given to identifying and evaluating alternative measures to lethal force used by police officers in the course of their duties. The National Police Research Unit (NPRU) is conducting a national project which is investigating some of these alternatives. A report on the project should be available to the Australasian Police Ministers' Council (APMC) later this year. I am advised that, to date, no testing of stun guns has been conducted as part of the research. I am therefore unable to comment on the suitability of the weapon for use in police forces. As for the use of stun guns in the Australian Defence Force, I believe this element of the question is best directed to the Honourable Minister for Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I am advised that stun guns come in two basic designs. One is hand-held similar to a torch with two electronic probes attached to the front of it. The unit is pushed against the body and activated, working in similar fashion to a cattle prod. The second is like a small handgun which fires two darts, connected to lengths of conductive cable, into the body of the subject at which time the charge is activated. The precise specifications of the Air Taser stun gun are not known, but the name implies it is operated with compressed air as a means for shooting the electric probes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Australian Customs Service (ACS) has advised that importation of product samples of these weapons would be treated in the same manner as individual or commercial imports of a standard unit. Stun guns are prohibited imports under Schedule 2 Item 12 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. Importation of stun guns is prohibited unless permission in writing is given by the Minister responsible for Customs. Applications for permission to import would need to be accompanied by written support for the importation of these items from the relevant State or Territory police authority, stating that the importer complies with all state or territory laws and requirements. I have been advised by the ACS however, that imports for the Commonwealth are not bound by the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations and therefore no permission to import is required to be issued to Commonwealth Government agencies. I have been further advised that, in the past, a standing authorisation by the Minister responsible for Customs has been granted for importation by or on behalf of State or Territory police authorities. Any further information in relation to the importation of and permission to import these items should be sought from the Minister responsible for Customs.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The Audit Report of 24 March 1995 on AESOP produced by BDO Nelson Parkhill (hereafter referred to as "BDO") states that the figure of $112,988 disclosed in AESOP's financial statements of 30 June 1994 as the Managing Director's remuneration package is not correct. BDO's finding has been confirmed by AESOP's auditors Messrs Coopers &amp; Lybrand. BDO estimates the correct figure to be around $135,000.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)(a) AESOP has to date received minimal funding from the private sector. For the four year period to 30 June 1994, AusAID grants represented an annual average of more than 97 per cent of AESOP's core funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6)(a) AESOP is a non-profit company limited by guarantee. The principal management structure is the Board of Directors, currently with nine members. The office bearers are the Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Treasurer. The Board normally meets every three months. There is a Finance Committee of the Board, comprising the Chairman, Treasurer and Managing Director, which meets annually to review staff salaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AESOP's Articles of Association provide for three classes of members and allow for each class to elect Directors. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is the Foundation Member. It appoints two Directors. Associate membership is available to volunteers who have successfully completed an AESOP project or made some other substantial contribution to the Company. Associate members elect two Directors. Organisation membership is available to companies and organisations which have contributed financially to AESOP or supported the program in other ways. Organisation members appoint four Directors. The Managing Director is an ex officio member of the Board. He is supported by nine staff at the Canberra Headquarters and fifteen overseas representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) AESOP's Directors have responsibilities deriving from both the general law and the Corporations Law. These can be summarised as the duty to exercise due skill and care, to act honestly and in good faith and in the interests of the company. Directors have a duty to exercise power for a proper purpose, to disclose all relevant information to members, and to avoid situations which may give rise to conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7)(a) AusAID plays no formal role in the management of AESOP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) AusAID has in the past sent an observer to AESOP Board meetings. The AESOP Board has recently agreed that the Director General of AusAID will have the prerogative to nominate a Director to the AESOP Board.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9)(b) The BDO Audit Report points out that AESOP has used funds from the core AusAID grant for non-recurrent costs, which is not strictly in keeping with the Grant Agreement between AusAID and AESOP. BDO suggests a number of options for bringing into alignment the terms of the Grant Agreement and AESOP's requirement for operating capital at the beginning of the financial year and for capital acquisitions. These include AESOP leasing capital acquisitions and/or seeking new sources of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9)(c) The Government has available a number of options relating to AESOP's compliance with the Grant Agreement, including requesting repayment of all expenditures on capital equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) Yes. Twelve trips were undertaken, five of which covered more than one country. Fares for two of the trips were met by the Managing Director reclaiming frequent flyer points, and one of the trips resulted from the Managing Director's participation in the Australian delegation to an APEC Business Volunteer Program seminar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) Yes. Again each trip involved visits to multiple countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) The question whether the amount of travel undertaken by AESOP staff is excessive is a matter for the AESOP Board. Prima facie, given AESOP's role in placing and monitoring volunteers in around 30 developing countries, and given the significant increase in AESOP's project portfolio in recent years, a substantial amount of overseas travel would appear to be justified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) There is a satisfactory system in place whereby receipted expenses are acquitted by the AESOP accountant and out-of-pocket expenses from cash advances are acquitted by the Treasurer of the Board.</PARA>
