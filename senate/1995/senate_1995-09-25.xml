<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank the Senate for granting leave. It did not seem to come particularly graciously minister, but I appreciate it all the same. We are traditionally quite generous in relation to the need for ministers to travel overseas on ministerial business, but this has reached ridiculous extremes today. Three ministers are absent this week. Let me start with Senator Cook. Senator Cook was listed to open that conference last night in Newcastle. It was too difficult apparently for him to do that on a Sunday night. It was good enough for opposition representatives to be there on a Sunday night.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apparently, for personal reasons, he wanted to change the opening until today. I do not believe the rumour that it was because of the replay of the football; that could not be right. Anyway, he asked that the opening be changed until 10.30 this morning. If he opened that conference at 10.30 this morning, why is it that he cannot be here answering questions this afternoon?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no reason at all for that, except, of course, if he is wanting to avoid certain questions&mdash;and anyone who has read this morning's press would know the sorts of things he is wanting to avoid. His much lauded innovation statement apparently is a wreck before it is off the starting blocks. We heard that he took it to the parliamentary caucus committee last week. What did they say about it? They said, `Cook's draft is a bronze medal strategy. It's absolutely lacking in substance.' Apparently the Glimmer twins decided to put out a briefing or two against Senator Cook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing is that that innovation statement&mdash;so important to Australian science&mdash;has been put off for month after month after month. Now we hear that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has had to take it over from Minister Cook. The question is: why shouldn't we be able to ask Senator Cook questions on that important national matter this afternoon? Did Senator Evans give any explanation as to why Senator Cook could not be here this afternoon? There was no explanation at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now get to Senator Schacht, who has been a most unsuccessful minister for small business. All he has given to small business is increased taxation. He was asked over the weekend about his taxation policies for small business. He was asked what was the government's response to an important parliamentary committee report which gave him advice on taxation and small business, and he said, `We're not going to speculate wildly about such matters.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely, in the interests of Australian small business, which has had to suffer so much under your policies, we should have every right to have Minister Schacht here today and to be able to ask him questions. If he has to go to Beijing to give a speech, why can't he go to Beijing, give the speech and come back and meet his responsibility to the parliament? It is this government that sets the timetable for the sittings of the parliament&mdash;not us&mdash;and it should set a timetable that is convenient to ministerial responsibility to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we have the foreign minister away again. We are, as I said, particularly generous to the foreign minister. Last week he wanted to go away on an economics conference and we said okay because we thought that might be helpful to him. But here he is again going away for the whole of the balance of this week, and it is totally unsatisfactory. We can do no more when these abuses occur but to protest, and I record the protest on behalf of this side of the chamber because our tolerance has been exhausted. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Gareth Evans, Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the Prime Minister's response to his previously respected economic adviser Dr Vince FitzGerald when Dr FitzGerald reminded him of the linkage between foreign debt and interest rates. The Prime Minister responded, `Well, Vince is a sour ex-bureaucrat. I mean, Vince gets the old lemon in the mouth every morning and gives a good hard suck on it. I mean, you'll never get any cheerful comments out of Vince about the economy, because Vince thought he should have been secretary of the Treasury and a few other things, and never made it.' Why must the Prime Minister attack in such personal and vicious terms anyone who offers him any constructive criticism or gives any advice with which the Prime Minister does not agree? Why shouldn't Australians expect the Prime Minister to debate issues in a civil way, rather than intimidate the messenger with such personal abuse?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1328" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree that whether Vince FitzGerald drinks lemon juice or orange juice in the morning for breakfast is not strictly relevant to the policy matters in issue here. What is relevant is whether or not he gets it right in what he says publicly about the relationship between a high level of foreign debt and relevant domestic interest rates, and whether or not, under the circumstances of his getting it wrong&mdash;as he has&mdash;the Prime Minister is entitled to correct him, which he has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is, so far as the substantive matters in issue here are concerned, that there is no direct relationship between the high level of foreign debt which Australia has at the moment and relevant domestic interest rates. I would like to hear anyone in the opposition saying to the contrary.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Alston" NAMEID="LD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well the question in issue and the reason which justifies the response of the Prime Minister in these matters is when people get it basically wrong in terms of the implications they are seeking to convey to the public and when the opposition party, as in this instance, picks it up and gets it even more fundamentally wrong in order to try to make some political point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that short-term interest rates are the product of monetary authorities' response&mdash;in the Australian case, the Reserve Bank's response&mdash;to the inflation rate environment and outlook. Because Australia's inflation outlook is very much under control and looks like remaining so for the indefinitely foreseeable future, so too will interest rates remain in that condition and not be governed by whatever happens so far as foreign debt is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> released just a couple of days ago makes clear the absence of any such relationship between short-term real interest rates and whatever might be the case so far as foreign debt is concerned. It is the short-term real interest rates which are the determinants of variable mortgage interest rates which Australian consumers and people are interested in; it is short-term interest rates which, in Australia, are standing up remarkably well in any international comparison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the table from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>, which you usually love quoting, you will see it shows Australia right in the middle of the field at the moment so far as short-term interest rates are concerned with lower real, not just nominal, interest rates than countries like Sweden, Spain, Canada, Italy, France, Denmark, Britain and the United States, most of whom of course have much lower levels of foreign debt than Australia does at the moment. There is simply no correlation between the two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Vince FitzGerald went on to make a number of other points, as he had in his public contributions, about the impact of foreign debt levels on sovereign debt ratings and risk premiums, when he went on to make further points about the absolute level of government debt as compared with foreign debt and its relation to interest rate payments, in each case he was simplifying, for whatever purpose, for whatever reasons, what is a vastly complex set of equations and relationships. The simple attempt that is being made by the opposition, calling in aid people like Dr FitzGerald making their own contributions to the public domain, to draw some linkage between the two is simply ill-founded. That remains the government's very clear position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our record on interest rates speaks for itself. Compare this with the appalling record of interest rate management under the last government that Mr Howard had a capacity to influence when he was Treasurer. There was a regulated interest rate regime and a monetary policy committee of cabinet sitting every week and setting these things, not letting in market forces. Every relevant interest rate in the book, whether it was housing loans rates, cash rates, 90-day bank bill rates or anything else, was much higher than the rates which are prevailing today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the record you have to explain. That is why we are so concerned to ensure there is no misrepresentation by anyone in the public domain of these fundamental important economic relationships. If you go on misquoting the extent of our foreign debt, the extent to which that is impacting adversely on the Australian community and misstating the impact of it, in particular on domestic interest rates, you have to expect the returns that you get. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. That was very interesting but it had nothing to do with the question that was asked. The Prime Minister was not responding to us at all; he was responding to his formerly highly respected adviser when that adviser said something he did not agree with. My question is: why must the Prime Minister always respond with personal abuse? Why can't he listen, rather than let the venom drip from his lips as he attempts to verbally abuse these people? Whether you understand it or not, Australians don't actually like it. But the interesting thing in asking this supplementary question is that after the Prime Minister abused Dr Vince FitzGerald he then, in effect, acknowledged the facts to be true when he said, `Australia's current account always puts some question into the exchange markets.' Of course, he then tried to rationalise that he was speaking in the longer term, which you have done today. Why always respond with personal abuse? Why not enter into the debate in a normal civilised way? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has a colourful turn of phrase, as we all know, and employs a lot of colourful language very often to make points which need to be made. The fact that those opposite are so limp, lacklustre and lifeless that they can never make an effective point at all in public communication is their problem, not ours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are doing, through the Prime Minister in this instance, is making very clear that, whatever might be the situation so far as Australia's perfectly manageable level of foreign debt is concerned&mdash;which is, nonetheless, high&mdash;that bears no relationship whatsoever to housing mortgage interest rates, which are the concern of ordinary, average Australians. That is the point the Prime Minister was making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Housing mortgage rates, variable mortgage interest rates, which do worry Australians, are not in any way linked to the level of foreign debt. What they are linked to is the level of inflation and inflationary expectations and the way in which monetary authorities in Australia manage short-term interest rates in response to that. That is the relevant economic relationship, not what you are trying to talk about here. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan. There is considerable reporting in the media today of a survey of the Committee of Economic Development of Australia, CEDA. This is on the barriers impeding Australia's exports to APEC members. According to the survey, Australian exporters face an extraordinary variety of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade which cost hundreds of millions of dollars in lost export opportunities and, therefore, Australian jobs.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, and congratulations, Madam Deputy President. The findings of the CEDA survey are actually no big surprise. They indicate what I think most people already knew. What they actually do&mdash;why they are important, and why I welcome the report&mdash;is put very clearly, very starkly, the critical importance of APEC  and  of  the  goals we have  set for APEC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It says that APEC is not some theoretical notion or, as some people seem to imply, something that is off the main game. It is a very bread-and-butter issue for ordinary Australians trying to get a job in a factory or an office, or make some money on a farm or from a mine. It is absolutely fundamental to our chances of effectively selling into the Asia-Pacific region that we maximise our chances of success under APEC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It says three important things about our efforts to ensure that we are locked into the growth area in our region. Firstly, it says that the government has got it right in its determination to make APEC work, in initiating it, in seeking to set the pace on it, and in continuing to seek with others to drive the program of reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the results do not come as a surprise. While they outline the fact that we should have no illusion about the size of the task before us, barriers like this are not insurmountable. We do not have to throw our hands up and say, `Look how hard it is', and walk away and hide. We did that for too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw similar reports on the size of the trade problem in agricultural subsidies during the Uruguay Round, but instead of, as in previous years, simply making speeches about it, we set out with a conscious strategy targeted to do something about it, particularly through the Cairns Group, and we made significant progress. Not enough to solve all our problems&mdash;we need to do more and we will do more&mdash;but a lot. We can do something similar through APEC. We cannot solve all our problems through APEC overnight but there is no better way to attack these regional trade barriers than APEC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing about the report is that it is proof that whatever inroads we can make into eliminating these trade barriers through APEC, Australia will win. The question in the period between now and Osaka is not whether Australia will benefit from the plans developed and approved at Osaka to implement the Bogor commitment, but how much we will win&mdash;not whether, but how much. The stakes are very high. It is very important that we keep the pressure on to maximise the benefits that flow to the whole region, and particularly, from our point of view, to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it shows that the APEC endeavour can touch upon Australians in very many walks of life. It illustrates the breadth and the depth of the issues involved in APEC. The government strategy, particularly through APEC in response to these barriers that Senator Collins has referred to in the CEDA report, is not just APEC. There is a multilateral strategy through continuing efforts in the WTO. There is the regional strategy through APEC; the subregional strategy through AFTA CER, which I will get a chance to talk about, I hope, later in the week; and the bilateral strategy through pushing in individual countries for them to open up their market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the release of the report. It should increase community awareness about the important role of APEC in removing these trade barriers and in generating opportunities and wealth for Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Deputy President. I also congratulate you. My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Now that the ABC's pay television venture is close to being in a terminal condition, does the government accept the views expressed by the heads of Foxtel, Optus Vision and Channel 7 that a pay television monopoly is inevitable? If not, why not? What action does the government propose to take to protect the $12.5 million worth of taxpayers' funds already invested in the venture and the jobs of 110 employees who took very significant career risks to sign on in good faith? Why has the government spent the last 18 months ignoring all the signs of trouble? Is it because the Prime Minister thinks the current level of taxpayer support to the ABC is too high, as he implied last Friday, and he has been hoping that the deal would fall over of its own accord?

I note that the New South Wales Labor government recently introduced drugs in sport legislation into the New South Wales parliament and, in doing so, the government has acted far more decisively on the important issue of drugs in sport than the previous coalition state government did.

The New South Wales legislation will reinforce the deterrence value of doping controls in the years leading up to the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

Is this cost of production the reason for the closure&mdash;temporarily, I hope&mdash;of the Murgon meatworks, the Coominya meatworks, Toowoomba Beef City, the Dinmore meatworks and the Biloela meatworks, resulting in the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs in Queensland alone?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would suggest to Senator Ian Macdonald that if he wants to know the answers to those questions then, instead of simply reading the printed question that is circulated at the start of question time every day to all of the opposition members, he actually read the Booz-Allen report from which those figures are drawn. It would be instructive reading for you, Senator Macdonald.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line of the Booz-Allen report that produced those figures is that between 60 and 70 per cent&mdash;in fact, closer to 70 per cent&mdash;of cost disadvantage that is suffered by Australian beef producers is entirely out of the hands of processors, Senator Macdonald. It is, in fact, due to factors such as distance to market, for example, the types of cattle that are produced for particular markets. The Booz-Allen report, in fact, came down with the conclusion that about 30 per cent, Senator Macdonald, of that cost disadvantage was attributable to factors that Australian industry can do something about. About 70 per cent of it is not; it is simply factors in the industry itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I suggest that you actually take the trouble to read the Booz-Allen report, Senator Macdonald, before you ask questions about it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study says that the main reason many women with young children find it hard to return to work is the cost of child care. That is one of the main barriers for women returning to work, but that has been overcome by the child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate. The report also highlights this government's commitment to helping families juggle balancing work and family commitments and responsibilities. Contrary to what we hear from those opposite, the report found that the child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate were of more assistance to women on low incomes than to women on high incomes. The report says:</PARA>

Again, a low income married mother with one child in care has her income boosted by about 15 per cent with the government's child-care subsidies.

I notice that the Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, said today in the press that the institution of marriage is at the heart of this government's agenda. If that is the case, why were last year's figures of marriage breakdowns and divorces the highest for any year since 1975? I am not suggesting that the government is directly responsible for marriage breakdown, but its economic and social policies are creating enormous pressures on marriages. Is it not a fact that the direct cost to taxpayers of marriage breakdown and divorces each year is over $3 billion, whereas you spend a mere $10 on average on education support?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the weekend the Attorney-General did refer to the fact that at the core of this government's policies and programs is a fundamental focus on the family. It has always been the case on our side that we recognise the family as a basic building block of our society. We recognise that recent press reports have been sensationalising divorce statistics. They have been misleading, but I think they have also struck a chord with people in our community. It is a chord that, regardless of what level the statistics indicate, national policy framers must take into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Supporting and strengthening families is essential to our government's agenda. We should recognise, with this in mind, that the government released the agenda for families earlier this year. That agenda highlighted quite a number of major initiatives that we have put in place to assist families. You would appreciate probably more than most, Senator Harradine, that some 10 per cent of the federal budget is directly spent on financial support for families. That is a large amount of money, but it is money geared towards assisting families in need and is particularly geared towards easing the stress levels of families. As I said, 10 per cent of federal government expenditure is spent on direct financial support for families. In this context, in terms of broader policies, we should also recognise that our economic management direction is also fostered on creating the right environment for the creation and maintenance of families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go through a number of initiatives, but let me point to one&mdash;I think you raised it indirectly, Senator Harradine&mdash;that is, initiatives within the law and justice area. For instance, the May justice statement provided major focus on support for families. Our initiatives were aimed at preventing legal problems and improving the options for resolving disputes where resort to the law is necessary. The justice statement itself lifted funding to a range of family relationship support services by some $12.3 million over four years. For instance, the number of places available in relationship preparation courses will be doubled to almost 45,000 by lifting total funding by $4 million over four years. Another $2.7 million will assist relationship and family service agencies to meet the problems facing non-English speaking background families. Funding will also be provided to improve access in remote areas and funding for family skills training services will be increased to $2.8 million over four years&mdash;a 50 per cent boost towards helping approximately 12,000 clients. As well as that, almost $3 million has been allocated to expand adolescent, mediation and family therapy centres in regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are some of the initiatives that the government gave a commitment to in the May justice statement. That justice statement also had a commitment towards continuing to build an agenda in the legal area to minimise the trauma that families suffer through separation and also to continue to build within the legal system a more sensitive system for handling family problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our position as a government is that yes, we do recognise that no matter what the statistics are, there needs to be a commitment by government to assist families in a preventative way. Much of our social justice agenda is geared towards that. Also, when people have to go to court, they are geared towards assessing them in that process as well.</PARA>

I am asking: what are you going to do about the fact that you only spend on average 10 bucks on marriage education per marriage? Why don't you take up the suggestion by Father Tony Kerin that, on notification of marriage by a couple, vouchers should be given to the couple for them to undergo marriage training? Why can't you give couples who are courting and contemplating marriage a voucher so that they can undertake marriage education, communication skills and so on?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did it about 18 months ago, actually. I signed up last year and I am quite happy about it, thank you very much. As I said, the stats, in a sense, are not the driving force here. The driving force of this government is to get the policies in place for people pre-marriage and if in fact they do have to hit the legal system. That is why there is a social justice program. That is why there are also major initiatives in rental assistance to assist families and people who are about to get married. You cannot see it in isolation. You just cannot see the government's response limited to a voucher system. If that is all you wanted, that would not cost much; it would be easy. The reality is that you have to attack this sort of issue at the core and across the spectrum. As I said, social justice is important. Continuing measures are important.

Minister, you have recently announced a number of measures to streamline immigration processes for visitors to Australia to make the whole system more convenient and efficient.

Can the minister outline what further reforms are planned to minimise delays for overseas visitors on arrival?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Denman for her continuing interest in this area. She is right; the government is keen to pursue an active agenda in this area to make entry into Australia much smoother and more efficient for those who want to visit this country&mdash;and some 3 million people in the last financial year did so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I announced just a few weeks ago&mdash;and senators will recall this&mdash;that, by the end of this year, visitors from around 16 countries will be able to have their visas issued by approved travel agents without having to visit Australian immigration posts. In this context, I explained the details of an agency arrangement for the Czech republic to the Czech ambassador last Thursday. I can announce that the arrangements are operating in Greece as from now. That is one area of reform that the government is very keen to move quickly on. It illustrates how keen we are to ensure that there is smooth and efficient entry into Australia by those wishing to come here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also keen to pursue new technology. In that context, we are making optimum use of technology to streamline the process at airports once passengers have arrived. My colleague the minister for customs, Senator Chris Schacht, and I are today announcing a unique reform which began over the weekend and which will benefit not only overseas visitors but also Australians coming home. It is an initiative called advanced passenger clearance and has been developed jointly by my department, Qantas and the Australian Customs Service. This is a world first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Advanced passenger clearance essentially means that incoming Qantas passengers will in future have their immigration and customs details cleared whilst they are still in the air. Initially, it will operate for Qantas flights from Los Angeles. The first flight to use the new process arrived in Sydney on Friday morning. We will be expanding the process in the next few months to cover all Qantas arrivals into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process is such that, at the Qantas check-in at Los Angeles airport, the passengers are offered advanced passenger clearance with their seat allocation and boarding pass. The check-in agent enters a passport or visa number in the Qantas computer and sends it to Immigration in Canberra for clearance. The passenger is then issued with a new immigration arrival card, answers the three questions on it, signs it and simply swipes the card's magnetic strip through the entry point at Sydney airport to confirm arrival. I think Senator Denman referred in her question to the fact that at the moment it takes 54 seconds to process a person coming into Australia. This initiative obviously will cut the time even further, as Qantas passengers will go directly towards specially designated channels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In announcing this initiative with my colleague Senator Schacht, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate all agencies involved for their innovative approach to customer service. It means that those people coming into Australia will have the capacity to have their clearance approved while they are still in the air, which will make it a very quick process when they arrive at the airports here.</PARA>

We have been advised by United States officials in Washington that France has not sought permission to transport fissile material or components through US controlled airspace. It does not become necessary for France to take the risk of being found to be breaching US law, because it does have alternative routes that are available&mdash;as I pointed out to Senator Bell and others who have written or spoken to me on this subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the earlier period of atmospheric tests, the US refused permission for French military flights on several occasions. The cargoes were then reportedly sent by sea. In the event of there being such a refusal now, it would be perfectly possible for the French to fly in the material through alternative, equally viable and efficient routes. This would be mainly through stopping over on French territory&mdash;such as Guadeloupe in the Caribbean. That was apparently not technically possible 20 odd years ago, but it is possible now. Under those circumstances, there is simply no reason to believe that the French are acting in the way that has been suggested by Senator Bell or in the press reports to which he referred. Accordingly, we do not see any foundation for being concerned about that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure all Australians would join with me in very warmly welcoming the agreement which has now been reached after many long days, weeks and, indeed months of negotiations between Israel and the PLO on the extension of Palestinian autonomy and in congratulating both sides on their commitment and perseverance over the last year and a half. It is an historic step forward for the peace process. It does pave the way for the holding of Palestinian elections and, indeed, the commencement on schedule next year, hopefully, of the final status talks, including on matters as sensitive as the future of Jerusalem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That agreement has been hard-won, even if Senator Hill is not showing any interest in it at the moment, and it should not be undermined by those seeking to score political points against the leadership of Israel and the leadership of the PLO. Even more, one can only hope desperately that it will not be undermined by the actions of extremists on both sides who fear the successful completion of the peace process. It has taken great courage, I believe, for the leaders of Israel and of the Palestinian Authority to show the restraint that they have in the face of such provocation to date. We can only hope that such restraint will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no acceptable, practicable alternative to a negotiated settlement in the Middle East. A return to the past of failures to meet and confront these issues across the negotiating table would be a disaster for everyone concerned. We certainly hope that both parties will seek practical responses to Israel's security concerns that do not entail economic hardship to Palestinians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that on the other track of the peace process, the Israel-Syria track, recent events have been less encouraging, although I am sure from my own recent visit to the region that there remains a strong commitment on both sides to achieving a settlement. Both sides are relying heavily on the United States to expedite the negotiations and it is clear that continuing United States engagement in the process is crucial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, unfortunately, no great evident desire on either side to move that negotiation forward at this stage. That is worrying because the window of opportunity for getting results is becoming increasingly limited. As the United States is about to enter an election year, it becomes more and more difficult to get US policy makers focused on being decisive in their responses to issues of domestic political sensitivity. Similarly, the Israelis are going to be increasingly occupied with their own elections next year, with all the difficulty that follows so far as keeping a rather fragile coalition majority together, given the disposition to engage in electoral grandstanding related activity&mdash;not an unknown phenomenon in other parts of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coming months will be crucial for the Syria-Israel track.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia does not recognise Taiwan and does not have official representation there. Taiwan residents may apply for visas through the Australian commerce and industry office (ACIO) in Taipei. Decisions to issue visas are made by authorised delegates in Hong Kong and ACIO evidences the visa issue in Taipei.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACIO is a legal entity under contract between Austrade and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), the peak body representing state-based chambers. A supplementary contract between my department and the ACCI provides for a visa facilitation service (VFS) within ACIO.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The $50 fee is not as Senator Parer seems to think a charge for a visitor visa. It is a charge for a commercial service provided by ACIO. The arrangement saves Taiwan residents the cost of travelling to Hong Kong to apply there, but that option remains open to them.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangement has been in place since July 1992. Without it, Australia would not have benefited from the boom in tourism from Taiwan which has seen visas issued rise from 40,156 in 1991-92 to 134,750 in 1994-95. The figure for 1995-96 is expected to go above 150,000.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other countries charge a range of statutory or other fees associated with visa issue to residents of Taiwan. For example, the American institute provides a similar type of service and charges NT750 (about $US30 or $A40) and a further $US20 for machine readable visas. ACIO is in the middle of the `market'.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the ACIO fee is not a statutory charge as Senator Parer seems to think but a commercial fee for a particular service comparable with the fees travel and other agents already charge for similar services around the world.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that residents would have to otherwise access an overseas diplomatic mission, the technical infrastructure involved and other ACIO overheads this charge is a moderate one and is subject to periodic review.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Ian Macdonald this day, relating to the closure of meatworks.</PARA>
<PARA>At the outset I declare that I have a financial interest in the beef industry and I have a knowledge that far exceeds anything that Senator Collins will ever acquire about the cattle industry. I have never heard so many misleading statements as I have heard this afternoon in response to that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts of the matter, Senator Collins, are that American beef is about 60 per cent more expensive off the hoof than Australian beef, yet it can be landed for sale in this country at about 40c a kilo cheaper. Do not tell me that is because the American abattoirs are out on the ranches. It has nothing to do with it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The heart of the cattle export industry in Australia is in central Queensland and that is now in a crisis&mdash;a crisis. The industry is just on the brink of survival. We have had a drought of major proportions for four years, running into the fifth year. No-one down here has any knowledge of the drought situation at all. It is really acute in relation to the cattle industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Abattoirs are not petrol stations or corner stores or supermarkets. They are a vital part of the cattle industry. They are the price setters. A producer of cattle who wants to sell his beasts really has to take what the abattoirs offer him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the abattoirs negotiate the export sales contracts. It is not the cattle producer, it is not some grand governmental authority&mdash;least of all, your department, Senator Collins&mdash;that negotiates the sales; it is the individual abattoir that negotiates the sales. There are three critical points in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that we probably have half the number of abattoirs that we had 20 years ago, so the competition is not there. Secondly, we have quite antique union relationships within the abattoirs because of the meat workers and their various unions. The third crucial point is overseas ownership, which is now very considerable in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing I want to talk about is the lack of competition that comes from the great reduction in the number of abattoirs. Because there are so few, you have to sell to the nearest abattoir. Therefore, they are the real price setters. There is no way you can negotiate with them for another few cents a pound on the beef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have become extremely tough in recent years, particularly with the classification of carcases and the fat layers. For 12 or 13 millimetres it is a certain price; for fat layers beyond that, if you are producing fat cattle for the Jap ox market, or something like that, the price drops dramatically. But the arbiter of the fat level is the abattoir. It is not possible for the producer to go in there or sell beforehand and know what the fat level is on their stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing is this antique relationship that the unions have in their industrial relations with the abattoirs. The fact of the matter, Senator Collins, is that the productivity&mdash;the throughput, the number of kills per hour in our abattoirs&mdash;is very significantly less than in other efficient abattoirs around the world. That is because of all the things we have inherited and which, in 13 years, you have not lifted a finger to correct. You have given in, time and time again, to whatever demands the unions make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise the difficulty of dealing with the meat workers. They would cut your throat in a flash and pretend they have just slipped on a wet floor. But they need to be taken on and, until they are taken on, the cattle industry has no future in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there is this matter of overseas ownership. You have a company like Conagra, which bought Australian Meat Holdings from its Australian owners. Conagra would have hundreds of millions of dollars tied up in the Australian beef industry but it has billions tied up in the American industry. It is faced with overproduction in the United States, a glut on the market there. It wants to corner the Japanese and Korean markets and it is quite prepared to close down, as it has in the last few weeks, the holdings it has in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the central point: we are in a crisis in this industry, which is not a small industry. The cattle market is the fourth largest Australian export industry, and it is basically situated in the central part of Queensland. I can tell you that it is in crisis today and that the government is not doing anything about it. It is not using the powers that it should have to preserve this vital Australian export asset. Given the mess that we are in with increased mortgage rates and interest rates through the community because of the huge overseas debt that you people have built up, you have a moral compulsion to do something about this. </PARA>

It is a crisis that has to be faced. There are 2,000 people out of work, and four or five abattoirs that have been closed down, as enunciated by Senator Ian MacDonald. The situation is getting worse. It is a question not only of the abattoirs closing down and of the lack of competition that the previous speaker, Senator MacGibbon, mentioned; it is also a crisis of drought, compounded by high interest rates and now, the coup de grace, the abattoirs closing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cattle industry just cannot continue to go on with the prospects with the way that the tally is counted in the abattoirs at the moment. When people reach their tally, they go home at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock. Then the huge amount of investment in the abattoirs is left there, not producing. This may have been all right in the days when we had forward contracts, but your own initiatives have brought us into a world market&mdash;we are trading in a global village. Time after time, Senator McMullan gets up and tells us that, and no-one on this side of the house would argue against that. But if you want to allow us to trade in a global village, if you want us to take part in a world market, and if you want to reduce the tariffs to nothing, if you want to do all these things that this side of parliament has not argued with, then you must bring us in with competitive abattoirs and an industrial relations system that works. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested to listen to some of the comments that have been made in regard to this matter. I would like to indicate that recently, on one occasion with the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, I visited a meatworks in Victoria. Admittedly, they do kill for local consumption, but they were quite proud of the fact that they had developed a method of management and a process of consultation with members of the meatworkers union which had been preceded by discussions with the officials of the meatworkers union, including Wally Curran, about these changes that were to take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those meatworks indicated to me that they had got a very good response from Wally Curran, the Victorian secretary, and that the people in that particular meatworks had cooperated quite well. They pointed out that they now were in a position to carry out much of the inspection work themselves and that they had been assisted by AQIS by way of AQIS putting in place a process where AQIS could have an overall auditing role but the inspection within the meatworks was carried out by people who were qualified in that area and working for the company. They also talked about this cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other areas where we had a number of public hearings on the role of AQIS it was pointed out to us that there were some problems regarding cooperation in relation to awards under which AQIS inspectors worked and meatworkers worked and that this process did add to costs. But I cannot recall one occasion where the accusation was made that the meatworkers were not conforming to what were reasonable circumstances. Because a number of meatworks have laid off people overnight, it has been suggested that all of sudden the burden has become so great that they had to lay off people. Those on the other side know that that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been said about the tally system. When there are any obstacles to what the opposition or some people in business see as the most fluent of operations that will give the best economic return, because of certain old ideas that have been perpetuated for some years, the union is always to blame. Let it be known very clearly that meatworkers have historically worked ordinary hours&mdash;going way back to the days when they worked 60 hours, as everyone else did. It was the employers who brought in the tally system to encourage workers to get in there, to do the tallying, to shorten the number of hours they would have normally done and to get out of the place, and that would guarantee the employers that over a certain number of hours or less they would get a certain tally. The employers brought in that, and now they are complaining about that as a concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say for one moment that changes should not be made in relation to this by way of discussion and cooperation, because anybody in the meatworks and that industry knows that quite a large volume of meat has got to go to export and that we have to compete against other people. But the people who suggest that, by doing the sorts of things that we may be able to do to increase efficiency and a more cooperative approach, we can surmount obstacles of cheap meat below what reasonably should be sold and competing unfairly by way of bounties or other assistance are smoking opium, because we cannot defeat that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that, if criticism is going to be made, let us level it at everybody in the industry because all of them have to carry some of the blame. Let us look to the future and rationally try to work out the best way to go forward in the interests of everybody in the industry and in the community. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 13 years in power, this government, a Labor Party government, has absolutely no solutions whatsoever to the problem. I asked Senator Collins to explain to me why it is that the abattoir costs per kilo finished weight are 41c in the United States, 72c in New Zealand, 105c in Argentina and 113c in Australia. There has to be some reason for that. Perhaps Senator Burns could have explained it to me. He did not, but perhaps he could have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins talked about the Booz-Allen and Hamilton report and told the Senate that the costs of processing the meat had something to do with transportation. Senator Collins knew that was an untruth and knew that he was misleading the Senate when he said that. It is typical of Senator Collins. He has been a failure as opposition leader in the Northern Territory parliament and a failure in every ministry he has taken here. His only approach when he is cornered is to get up and abuse the questioner. You wait: as soon as I sit down, he will get up again and he will abuse me. He will spend four minutes out of his time calling me names. They do not worry me. Names from Senator Collins do not worry me.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins was trying to tell the Senate that these different costs related to transportation. As he would know if he read this Booz Allen and Hamilton report&mdash;I suspect he has not&mdash;the costs of delivering to the market are listed on page 42. It shows that the cost of processing in Australia is 112.7c per kilo. It will also show that transportation is an extra 37.1c per kilo. It will show that in the United States the price is 41.2c per kilo for processing and the costs of transportation are an additional figure. In New Zealand, 71.7c per kilo is the cost of meat processing. Transportation in New Zealand is 28.4c additional. This is the sort of minister we have on the government side.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After having listened to Senator Cooney's comments, I wish to make a few of my own on the same subject. This is one of the few occasions of which I am aware when Senator Cooney has been so glib in his presentation before this chamber. He has misquoted my colleague Senator Boswell, deliberately or otherwise, and in no way has he faced up to the real and serious issues affecting this most important $6 billion industry with its uncompetitiveness in our international markets, which we are now debating. Senator Cooney, if you are going to take up the brief of defending Senator Collins and Senator Burns in this chamber, you should have started long ago; even had you done so, you still would never be out of this chamber&mdash;in particular, with the brief of Senator Collins with his long list of blunders in other ministeries, such as his promises about waterfront conditions and pay TV.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issue before us is the uncompetitiveness of this particular industry; it is highly uncompetitive. Those on the other side of the chamber have approached this issue with a heartlessness being exhibited towards farmers. If this Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) has ever had a serious obligation toward his ministry, it is now, due to the drought and the low commodity prices that farmers have borne for the last four to five years. Farmers now simply cannot take this final straw&mdash;that is, the uncompetitiveness of the processing component of the beef industry. In fact, it is the whole monumental cost structure that drags down our competitiveness internationally and, indeed, illustrates the fundamental malaise within our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was quoted by other speakers, our farmers are the most efficient beef farmers in the world. As just one measuring stick, in the past 20 years farm productivity in labour has increased by so much that it is now some 50 per cent greater than the average OECD farm productivity figures. Yet in the last 20 years the terms of trade have decreased on an OECD scale&mdash;and that has far outweighed any increase. Farmers are playing their particular part. But once the product leaves the farmgate that is when, layer upon layer, the cost structure is laid on. That occurred last year until we reached the absurd point of having one of the major American chain stores, Sizzler, importing or attempting to import&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WH4">Senator McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They didn't in the end, but they attempted to import American beef into this country. So it is a fact that we have the absurd situation where American beef can be imported into this country and sold domestically cheaper than we can do it ourselves in this country. The facts are there, Senator Collins. The farmer in America receives some 60 per cent more off the hoof to buy American beef, yet they can deliver it to this country some 40c to 50c cheaper a kilo than we can deliver in our own country. That is an absurd situation. It costs something like 41c a kilo to process meat in the United States, 72c in New Zealand and $1.13 a kilo in Australia. Can you see how uncompetitive we are?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the union movement must take on the burden for the unproductiveness of this particular industry and, if nothing else, for the waterfront. The uncompetitiveness of the waterfront has certainly been borne out by one of the government's own reports by the Bureau of Industry Economics in August 1995 showing just how uncompetitive our waterfront has become. It relates directly back to the union movement, and so does the processing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Burns quotes Wally Curran as a reformer. For the last 20 years or more Wally Curran has shut down abattoirs in Victoria and has been the reason for the shutdown of abattoirs in Victoria. I am not even sure whether there is an abattoir in Victoria any more; there would be only one or two. They have all shifted to other states. They have gone to Queensland and they have been pursued vigorously in Queensland. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Senator MacGibbon complained about the extent to which Conagra has invested in the Australian beef industry and suggested, by necessary implication, that the government should have a direct role somehow in setting up additional meatworks around Australia. That was an interesting contribution from Senator MacGibbon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal point at issue is the very serious problem that is currently being experienced by beef producers and the towns that rely on their product in Queensland. I hope, along with the rest of the government, that that is short-lived. But it is foolish indeed to attribute the entire problem to industrial relations, as opposition speakers have done. It just indicates their profound ignorance of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal reasons are, as I said, the increased and quite serious competition from the United States into that market at the moment and the increase in the Australian dollar&mdash;and, I might add, the increasing costs of cattle for processing which has resulted from the need to feed grain to a lot of these cattle. Senator Boswell was honest enough to concede that a lot of this problem is in fact related to the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said accurately, despite Senator Macdonald's assertions, the Booz Allen report, and he quoted from those figures, did point out that a great percentage of the competitive problems that are suffered by Australian beef producers&mdash;about 70 per cent&mdash;are not addressable by processors. One of those problems, as I correctly said, was transport&mdash;that is, the distance from the cattle supply to the processor. If Senator Macdonald bothers to read the report, he will in fact discover that that is so. I hope, along with all other senators, that the problems being suffered in North Queensland are short-lived. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government really is desperate about the next election. How else do we explain its constant resort to the lie as the norm of political conduct when it comes to speaking about the economy? How else do we explain the tirade of defamatory vitriol, personal abuse and denigration that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) threw at the government's national savings adviser last Friday because of Dr FitzGerald's temerity in stating the blindingly obvious, namely, `There is a risk premium in our whole interest rate structure relating to the high level of foreign debt'?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How else do we account for the evidence of the Carmen syndrome&mdash;that is, `I forget' or `I can't recall'&mdash;in the Prime Minister's recent statements denying a link between Australia's massive debt burden of $187,000 million, which is equivalent to $10,000 for every man and woman in Australia, and our interest rate structure, including mortgage interest rates? How could it be that the Prime Minister forgot last Friday that just a few years ago, at the height of the interest rate increases that we had in 1989 due to his own policies, the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister Keating, justified using high interest rates because they had the benefit of sharing the pain of attacking Australia's trade and debt problems, which spending cuts did not? Let me quote briefly from what the Prime Minister said at that time:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monetary policy gives you a reduction (in living standards) across the board so the yuppies are paying, too!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their disposable incomes are reduced by the interest costs of their investment, their mortgages or what have you.</PARA>
<PARA>And here comes the rub. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That's why there has to be a national effort, a fair and equitable spreading of the burden in reducing the current account deficit and sharing the burden on living standards.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Prime Minister&mdash;the then Treasurer in 1989&mdash;drew, quite correctly, in the clearest possible terms, the link between the current account deficit, foreign debt and the interest rate structure in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How else, other than desperation at the present situation, can you explain the fact that virtually no respectable economist in Australia agrees with Treasurer Willis and his representative in this chamber, Senator Cook, who echoed the same words as Mr Willis last week, both of whom claim there is, to quote Treasurer Willis, `not one skerrick of truth' and that it `is completely and utterly untrue that foreign debt means higher rates of interest for Australians'? That is what the Treasurer said last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is panicking. That is good for us, of course, but it is not good for Australia or for Australians, because what it means is that the electorate is being fed&mdash;and will continue to be fed until the next election&mdash;a diet of deliberate untruths about the state of our economy and about the government's role in this. That is why I have brought forward this matter of public importance for debate today, namely:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's desperation in attempting to cover up its economic mismanagement by its denial of the obvious impact of Australia's massive foreign debt on domestic interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before looking at the real facts, though, let me also draw attention to the divisions within the government's most senior ranks on this matter. On the one hand, Treasurer Willis and Senator Cook, as I said, have asserted there was no link between our foreign debt and domestic interest rates. On the other hand, the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, asserted quite the opposite a few years ago. Even in the last few days the Prime Minister seems to be much more equivocal than the Treasurer, because it was only last Wednesday that the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must work to deal with the problem&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, of the current account deficit and foreign debt&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">so we're not paying too high a premium on world interest rate markets.</PARA>
<PARA>A clear allusion there, I would have thought, to the link that he sees, quite rightly, between the debt level and our interest rate structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where does the Prime Minister really stand on this issue? It is yet another sign of a divided, disparate, desperate, incompetent, tired government which is in office well past its use-by date. Let me look at some of the facts, as distinct from the economic illiteracy being peddled by the government. In this context, by the way, I note that I am not surprised that Senator Wheelwright, who participated in a similar type of debate last week, does not seem to be included in Labor's batting team for this one. Unless things have changed, given his appalling performance last week, I was not at all surprised to see him dropped and Senator Burns substituted for him. It looks like Senator Burns might have got hurt at training last night and they have brought him back from the reserves. I welcome that very much indeed, Senator Wheelwright. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us have a look at a few of the facts and some of the things that real experts have said about this situation. Just a few months ago, in June in fact, the OECD released its report on Australia. It said in that report that `the widening current external deficit', which leads to higher foreign debt, exerts `significant upward pressures on Australia's real long-term interest rates'. The OECD said that. Normally the OECD does not put out reports on any particular country without getting the broad imprimatur of the country's own economic advisers. Whether that was the case or not, I do not know in this instance. It would be surprising if it was not, but certainly that is what the OECD said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would not surprise me if government advisers had given that imprimatur to the report because only a month earlier, the budget papers brought down in May that were circulated with the authority of the Treasurer, Mr Willis, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a high level of foreign borrowing relative to GDP can impose costs on an economy by making it more vulnerable to external shocks and by raising interest rate premia on borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA>That also was not an unusual statement. It seems to me to be blindingly obvious that that would be the case and I think the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, at the time of the Reserve Bank annual report and in other speeches surrounding that occasion made precisely the same point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inevitably, higher interest rates on foreign borrowings will flow through to the home mortgage market and the business lending market as banks hold a large portion of Australia's foreign debt. It is no coincidence at all that Australia has the highest current account deficit in the OECD, the 47th worst ratio of net foreign debt to exports out of 51 countries rated by Standard and Poor's, and the highest bank prime interest rates among the developed economies surveyed by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>&mdash;much higher, as we all know, than the interest rates in most of our important regional trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that Labor is desperately trying to escape culpability for Australia's record $187,000 million of foreign debt. In so doing, it is recklessly and wantonly throwing truth on this matter out of the window. The reality of the situation is that Labor is to blame on this matter. There is a direct connection between Labor's budget deficits and Australia's foreign debt. Every respectable economist in Australia knows that. Every member of the government, if they are honest and prepared to admit it, knows that. Certainly every Australian who has suffered under the bludgeoning of interest rate policy, of falling living standards and of massive economic incompetence throughout this government's term of office knows that all too well. The result is that we have now a situation where we have a foreign debt that is incredibly high by any standards. It is eight times higher than it was when this government came to office and is a major cause of the fundamental problems underlying our economy in the long term. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance purports to assert that the government is seeking to cover up the economic situation in Australia today and the economic record of the government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would we be concerned to prevent the Australian people from knowing that we have had an increase in labour productivity of 2.5 per cent a year?

Why would we not want people to know of the significant improvement in Australia's external competitiveness over the last five years&mdash;or over the last decade if you want to measure it over a longer period? Why would we not want people to know that exports have grown by more than 50 per cent&mdash;or in real terms by five percentage points of GDP&mdash;in the last five years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you look at it on balance, there are a lot of things we want the people of Australia to know. What we want is a real choice for the Australian people&mdash;a choice between the government's plans and the opposition's plans to deal with the reality of Australia's economic circumstance. What are the competing policies going to be on important issues such as the current account deficit, growth and inflation? If the Australian people knew that, it would allow them to make a judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a fundamental issue for all Australians to be concerned about, and it is the issue we should be addressing here. I waited for 10 minutes to hear the slightest glimmer&mdash;or perhaps I should say the smallest dribble&mdash;from Senator Short about what the opposition's policy to deal with this might be, and I did not hear a word. He did not mention one word about what their policy to deal with this might be. That is a conscious policy of the opposition&mdash;the only policy they have is not to let anybody know what their intentions are. It is the only policy that has been made clear up until now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition have set out to be deliberately misleading about the connection between debt and mortgages. It is true that it is arguable, and there is evidence to suggest linkages between a country's level of overseas debt and its ratings by the international ratings agencies, which might affect interest rates so you have to borrow long-term overseas, although it is not a very direct link. The level of external debt relative to GDP for both New Zealand and Canada is higher than for Australia, but they both have the same rating as us. So it is not a direct relationship. Those countries, which are sometimes used as comparisons with us when it suits the opposition&mdash;and they were not mentioned in this debate&mdash;have the same rating as us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect is not direct but, when you try to lead with that and follow through to say that this is part of what determines the variable mortgage interest rates that ordinary Australians are borrowing on their homes, you are stretching a very long bow&mdash;like the long bow that Senator Short deliberately put in. The opposition is misleading the Australian people with their truck they are taking around&mdash;their debt truck they imported to build up our debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where the opposition tries to assert that, because this debt was overwhelmingly caused by the borrowings of the private sector, we all have a share in it. If that logic follows, it means that somehow or other all Australians have a share in the assets Australia's private sector has built up overseas&mdash;so we are all little shareholders in Escondida, the big copper mine in Chile that BHP owns. If we are all partly responsible for the overseas debt of the Australian private sector, it would be equally logical to say that we are all participants in its assets. It is not an argument you ever hear the opposition putting, because there is a significant increase in the assets of Australian companies overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us get down to the serious questions about interest rates. Senator Evans in his answer to a question today made clear the situation that was reported only in part&mdash;in fact, it was sufficiently reported only in part by Senator Short to be almost deliberately misleading&mdash;about what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> has said about short-term interest rates. Senator Short slipped away from the fact that what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine said about borrowing costs and real interest rates was that Australia's real interest rates are significantly below the halfway point in the 15 countries it listed for whom it has done an assessment of real interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the countries below us on that list have a much lower rate of growth than us. We could perhaps have lower interest rates if we slashed our rate of growth and stopped creating so many jobs. That is not a trade-off that, I think, Australians would advocate, but it is a policy that the opposition are entitled to put forward in a democracy. It is perfectly legitimate. If they want to put that to the Australian people, let us hear them do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been a country with debt since 1788. We have always drawn on overseas capital. The key thing is: can we afford to pay the money back? Our debt servicing ratio&mdash;that is, the amount of our exports of goods and services we have to use to fund our debt&mdash;has fallen dramatically in recent years. It has fallen to make it clearly a very manageable proposition. It has fallen from 20 per cent to about 11 per cent, and that is a significant improvement caused by a number of factors, including the increase in our exports. We are getting the rate down to manageable proportions, to proportions comparable with those of other economies with which we tend to compare ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can we do better? Yes. Do we need to do better? Yes. Is it improving? Clearly, yes, it is. That brings us to the key point. In a democracy approaching an election, is looking back at the past the basis upon which the Australian public can make an informed choice? They want to know what the competing proposals are for the future and what the proposals are to deal with the problem of the current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our strategy has been outlined by me, of course, and more significantly by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other senior ministers in the government on a number of occasions. It is clearly on the record: to deal with savings through reducing public sector outlays and through superannuation, to deal with efficiency, to deal with industry policy and to deal with, in my own area, the question of trade, the improvement of exports and import competition, opening up new markets and making ourselves more effective in the region. It is a long complicated argument, but in essence those are the four elements of the strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the opposition's strategy to deal with this issue? We did not hear a word of it from Senator Short. You have not heard a word of it from Mr Howard&mdash;and you will not, because they do not want the Australian people to have an informed choice because they fear what that informed choice will be.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us go to that prominent consumer of Australian orange juice, Dr Vince Fitzgerald. He concedes that Australia's foreign debt is high, but Australia after all has been in debt to foreigners for all of its 207 years of white settlement. Dr Fitzgerald goes on to describe our $180 billion net foreign debt as `not unmanageable'. In fact, last year it declined as a percentage of GDP. The proportion of our export income needed to service the debt is lower now than it was five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if Australia continues to run a high current account deficit, our foreign debt, in our view, will inevitably rise. The key variable driving this is not so much the cyclical trade balance, but the underlying income deficit; that is, the interest we are paying on our foreign debt and the profits we have to repatriate to foreign investors. That is the reason we think our current account deficit will not be brought under control even as our trade performance improves. It is this income deficit&mdash;the interest and profit payments&mdash;that ensures that our foreign debt will probably continue to progressively rise over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are being asked in this matter of public importance: is there a direct link between this and interest rates? The Australian Democrats think the news is mixed, but at this point in time mostly negative. As a capital importing country, we need to be able to continue to attract both lenders and investors. The surest way to attract lenders is by offering high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Dr Fitzgerald points out, interest rates on Australian bonds are about two per cent higher than on US bonds, and much of this difference is probably because of the risk premium associated with our interest rates. It is true that this feeds into interest rates on housing, mostly through the fixed term mortgages, which tend to be funded by the banks through longer term bonds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is relevant too, and I am going to come to that in a minute. So our high current account is feeding into these interest rates indirectly. Interest rates, however, on bonds peaked in January and have been falling for most of the year. Interest rates on fixed term mortgages have also been falling over the course of the year. So the news for most of this year has actually been `good', relatively speaking, and has meant lower interest rates rather than higher ones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I want to add to the debate that the net foreign debt figures tell only half the story. Our foreign debt has stabilised since 1989 largely because of the dramatic increase in foreign equity liabilities. This government has promoted a massive debt for equity swap. Over the past decade the level of foreign investment in Australia has risen from 16 per cent of GDP to over 36 per cent&mdash;that is in one decade&mdash;and it is still rising. Foreign equity investments are more expensive to service than foreign debt. I have been saying that here for six years, and I think we are going to see some of the predictions we have been making come to reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the ABS, Australia's net foreign debt liabilities stand at about 16 per cent of GDP, but net foreign debt liabilities stand at about 39.8 per cent. Senator McMullan said that it is getting easier to manage. But if you look at the statistics for servicing the debt, you will see that for every dollar we pay overseas in interest on the debt we are now paying 80c in profits to foreigners. That is a very close gap, I would argue. That means that foreign investment is more than twice as expensive as foreign debt and, unlike debt which is eventually paid out, ownerships and profits stream overseas. This will be eating away at our current account deficit&mdash;if not forever&mdash;for a long, long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is telling only half the story, in our view, because the servicing of the foreign debt is only about half of the income drain through the current account deficit. The opposition does not want to talk about the other side. I suspect to admit that a laissez-faire approach to foreign investment, which is what we have seen so far from the opposition, is adding to our current account problems would obviously raise questions about why coalition governments have sold off Victorian power stations, the Bank of Western Australia, the Adelaide water supply, Melbourne freeways&mdash;all of these things&mdash;to foreign interests. It is to put a question mark over the short-termism of the opposition's proposal to sell 49 per cent of Telstra offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia does have a chronic national savings problem. That much we know. We have been living with a national savings problem for 207 years by importing money, and that is not new. We do need to reduce public sector indebtedness but not in a climate of crisis. We do not believe we are in a climate of crisis except with respect to the escalating amount of foreign investment in this country and what that means for Australian ownership in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do need a debate about the best means of reducing public sector indebtedness&mdash;who should pay, where costs should be cut, what taxes might need to rise to pay for these things. So far we have not heard the coalition's contribution to this debate. Where will it spend? Where will it tax? These matters are not on the table. The Australian electorate deserves better than unfounded prime ministerial outbursts of illogic and coalition mutterings of gloom and doom uncluttered by suggestions of how to fix it. </PARA>

It is a matter of public importance because there is not a household in this nation that does not pay the price of the foreign debt which this Labor government has inflicted upon this country. There is not a business in this nation that does not pay the price for foreign debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators on the other side disagree, I need only draw to their attention the fact that every dollar that we pay in interest on our foreign debt is money that leaves our economy. It is money that is not spent at home. It is money that is not being spent in the towns and communities of regional Australia. It is money that is not creating jobs in the powerhouse of this nation. It is the reason why the standard of living of ordinary Australians is lower than it needs to be. The Labor Party is in the process of bankrupting this nation. They are the facts and they are very simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have the enormous foreign debt that we have at the  moment, and if we continue to accumulate it at the rate at which it has been accumulated under this Labor government, this nation cannot survive as a prosperous nation in our region. Twenty-five years ago all that most Australians knew about Asians was what they saw on `Paul Hogan goes to Hong Kong'. Paul Hogan and Strop were sitting on the back of a rickshaw and a little Chinese man was running along in front pulling the rickshaw. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you go to South-East Asia, you do not find any rickshaws any more. You do not even find any trishaws. The only place you will find trishaws in South-East Asia is in Cairns. It is the Asian tourists who are sitting on the back and it is the Australian kids who are sitting up the front pedalling and pulling them along. That is a sign of the decline of this nation's economic prosperity, and it is directly attributable to the failed economic policies of the people who sit opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true, it is incontrovertible, that we, as borrowers of money from banks, be it as people who have mortgages, overdrafts or credit cards, pay more than we need to pay because of the policies of the government. There are three reasons why that is so. The first reason why we pay more is that our foreign lenders ask for what is called a risk premium. In other words, they sit there, look at the economy, look at the current account deficit, which is the amount of money we bleed overseas every year, look at our foreign debt and say, `How likely are these people going to be able to repay next year, or five or 10 years down the track?' The higher you get in debt, the higher the current account deficit, the higher the risk premium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Kernot pointed out, the difference between the bond rate applying in the United States and the bond rate applying here is two per cent. Not all of that is risk premium, but you have to ask yourself why it is that it costs us more to borrow here than it costs the United States. It costs more in part because the people who lend us money have less confidence in this country than they have in our competitors. The signals that this government sends overseas damage our economy and make us all pay more for the amount that we borrow from banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Banks, after all, merely borrow money from offshore to lend to people in Australia. If a bank has to pay more to borrow overseas, it has to recoup that price. The interest rate that the bank pays is the price of money. To make a profit a bank has to charge a higher price than it itself pays for money. In other words, if banks have to pay more when they go offshore to borrow, we as the people who borrow from banks pay more in turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a reason why banks have to go offshore to get the money to lend to the Australian population. The reason is that the savings base of this country has been destroyed. The savings base of this country has been annihilated under the mob that sits opposite. When they came to power savings constituted 15 per cent or $1 in $6 of our post-tax income. This year's budget papers showed that savings under Labor are now three per cent or $1 in every $33 of after-tax income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is not a big enough pool of money here at home to finance the requirements of Australian borrowers, then where are our banks going to get the money? Of course they are going to go offshore. Of course they are going to borrow overseas and of course our foreign debt goes up. All Australians are part of the reason for the foreign debt&mdash;partly because we borrow from our banks and partly because the government has destroyed the capacity of ordinary Australians to put money in their savings accounts. It is the government's economic policy that has made this happen and it is the government that must be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, that little pool of funds that does exist is being raped and pillaged by this government, which itself is borrowing $200 billion. Sure, it is not borrowing from overseas; it just happens to borrow the tiny little pool of money that sits around floating in the Australian domestic economy. If the government has its hand in the till, it is obvious there is no room for any of us. It is obvious that, if we want to borrow money to finance business or houses or whatever, the banks that lend the money to us have to go offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the Senate was treated to a foretaste of this debate as a result of a contribution by a Lord Lucan look-alike over there who has promptly done a Lord Lucan and disappeared from the chamber. He has disappeared from the debate. Quite frankly, I do not blame him. He made a fool of himself and he made a fool of this government. The truth is that this nation deserves better than it gets under Labor. This nation deserves a chance to save. This economy deserves a chance to grow instead of being constrained by debt, as it is under the people who sit opposite. </PARA>

The jargon becomes a bit wearing at times but this document relates to the ratio of our net foreign debt since June 1987 through to June of this year, quarter by quarter, and compares that with the interest rates quarter by quarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without going into all of the statistics in significant detail, the document shows that our net foreign debt from June of 1987 to June 1995 has increased from 32 per cent to 39.8 per cent. So the net foreign debt over that period has increased. But what has happened to interest rates over that same period?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition argue that the debt has increased, and that is true, but they also argue that that is what has driven up interest rates. In fact, in June 1987, interest rates were 15.5 per cent. Today they are 10.5 per cent; they have come down by a half. Net foreign debt has increased but interest rates have come down by a half during that period. Surely that proves that the relationship the opposition are trying to show between debt and interest rates is a false one; it is a false argument. The opposition are simply wrong on that issue. </PARA>

We are continuing to get that desperate approach from the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask: what is the foreign debt? The federal government directly contributes to just four per cent of the foreign debt. State governments contribute 27 per cent, while 60 per cent of the debt is from the private sector. In other words, when companies want to expand, they borrow money, overseas as well as on the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a capitalist, free enterprise system, those companies go out with asset backing and their profits&mdash;or maybe their losses, although they would have trouble borrowing a lot of money if they had significant losses over a long period&mdash;and they borrow money. There is nothing wrong with that as long as their asset backing and the strength of the commercial viability of their businesses back up that borrowing. The government does not control that. That is the private sector's business, it is not the Commonwealth government's business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the federal government is directly responsible for just four per cent, or $4 out of every $100, of Australia's debt. Private business, with its own asset backing and its own business strength, is responsible for 60 per cent of that debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important point about debt is whether it is sustainable. Most of us borrow money at some time or another. We have to be able to sustain that debt through our income level. We also have to have asset backing on that debt. The critical point is that while our debt has gone up, the economy has also grown. In fact, the economy has grown at a faster rate than the debt of the country. The critical question is: can we support the debt levels that we have today? The answer is: we can. But John Howard, the recycled opposition leader, has no policies until election time, particularly on this critical issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best way of understanding the size of the foreign debt is to compare it to the size of the economy. Since September 1993, the size of foreign debt relative to the size of the economy has decreased. In other words, the economy has increased faster than the debt. We are in a better position today to finance foreign debt than at any other time in our recent past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Debt is not a bad thing as long as you can support the debt, as long as you can repay it, so long as the borrowings are going into the economy and producing productive investment, producing jobs.

Senator O'Chee is grand on rhetoric in debate but there was not too much fact or substance. Even though our debt has increased, it is sustainable, as the facts show.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not like using economic jargon but, using the terminology, the debt service ratio peaked in June 1990. Five years ago was the worst point for us in respect of debt. In June of 1990, the debt service ratio was 20.6 per cent. Since then it has declined substantially&mdash;because, as the economy has grown, debt has grown&mdash;but the economy has grown faster and our debt service ratio now stands at 11.4 per cent. So our ability to repay the debt has improved significantly in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still more to be done&mdash;we do not deny that there is a problem&mdash;but the important thing is the size of the problem and how we deal with it.

Dr FitzGerald has accused the government of being the major source of our debt and national savings problem&mdash;and that, of course, is exactly right.

<PARA>At the same time, Australian investment abroad has also gone up, but overseas borrowings were used to fund most of Australian equity investment abroad. So there is no doubt that foreign debt has created a major problem for Australia&mdash;a factor which influences interest rates. It is not the only determining factor&mdash;we have never said so&mdash;but it influences interest rates and is a factor in what is happening in the market. This is what the Treasury says in its latest winter 1995 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Roundup</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a high level of foreign borrowing relative to GDP can impose costs on an economy by making it more vulnerable to external shocks and by raising interest rate premia on borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what the Treasury says; it is not what the Treasurer (Mr Willis) says. It was, in fact, what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said before he suddenly realised that what he said was not politically useful and so pretended he had never said it. This is what the Treasury says and what we say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many factors can influence the international financial markets' assessment of the overall sustainability of a country's external liabilities or current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>Foreigners are lending us money every month to the tune of up to $3 billion for one simple reason: we are not exporting enough&mdash;or else we are importing too much&mdash;to pay our bills, including our massive interest rate on the huge amounts of money we keep borrowing every month just to pay the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolute nonsense for the government to run around saying, `Oh, but that money is borrowed by the BHPs and so on of this world.' The fact is that the great bulk of this money is transferred in the foreign exchange markets, particularly to financial intermediaries. Who borrows from financial intermediaries in terms of short-term government securities? The government itself. It is hidden. So people like Senator Sherry, who know nothing about economics and marketplaces, do not realise, as Dr FitzGerald does, that this hidden foreign investment in the government is of massive proportions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today, if Senator Sherry has the capacity to read it&mdash;sorry, to understand it. I presume he can read it, but he has to have the capacity to understand it. Dr FitzGerald says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the Commonwealth has recently been issuing its debt securities domestically, it may seem to be responsible for only a minor part of the debt. Roughly half the debt that is counted as private includes amounts raised by banks to be on-lent to others.</PARA>
<PARA>He makes this conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet it makes no material difference whether the government issues debt securities directly to foreigners or receives funds from them indirectly through a bank.</PARA>
<PARA>Let that be some sort of major lesson in reality to the people who keep talking about this alleged four per cent government foreign debt. That is nonsense. Apart from anything else, the total government foreign debt is something like $110 billion out of $180 billion total net debt, and I compare it to net debt because the government does not have much of a net position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we have the government, a massive borrower, involved very heavily in having an interest rate policy which has failed. We have this extraordinary situation, despite what Senator Sherry has said, where you have had these increases in the last 12 months: bank housing rates up by 1.75 per cent; bank prime rate up 1.75 per cent; and overnight cash rate up 2.75 per cent. What happened to the balance of payments? Over the latest year, it is up from $17 billion to $27 billion&mdash;all obviously just a terrible coincidence, according to Senator Sherry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure, there are other factors that influence rates and, sure, there are times when short-term rates move in different directions to long-term rates, but that is because of people's expectations about the future interest rate movements, particularly our balance of payments problem and what is going to happen to it, interest rates in general and inflation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

What would the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) have done? Would he have kept the high tariffs in place? Would he now repudiate the wage and incomes accord, which is recognised to have helped keep wages stable and inflation low? To create a balance in the current account, would he reintroduce a regulated Australian dollar, establish new tariffs, increase the ones that we have now and take other steps to restrict capital flowing to Australia? What make us a country that is unattractive for capital to be invested, to prevent Australians from purchasing imports, capital goods, merchandise and services? If the Leader of the Opposition took such steps, he would be a mean-spirited hypocrite, as would those who would support him in such a proposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the small advantages of being a minor party is you often get to have the last word in a matter of public importance. I want to put on record some basic points that have seldom been mentioned in this debate. Yes, debt levels are rising and this is a problem. Australia's debt is not the same as government deficit. The twin deficit theory was debunked in the late 1980s. The majority of national debt, as has been mentioned, is private sector generated. Senator Sherry mentioned a figure of around 60 per cent, and that has been the case for some time, but deregulation of the financial sector in Australia has made it very difficult for government to have much impact on this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We deregulated our financial sector in the 1980s as a precursor to preparing for the Uruguay Round of GATT. When did we ever assess what the impact of various levels of financial deregulation would be? What we have to ask now is: who is running the financial markets, who is running Australia's financial sector, and what level of control over such things as interest rates does the international money market have? When we answer these questions I think we then begin to see that as a precursor to the Uruguay Round of GATT we have now linked up to a new, very substantially changed trade regime which, despite any changes that may have occurred anyway, has pushed us to change our domestic economy vastly and made us vastly more vulnerable to international money markets and international resource markets, which can change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are speculating on resources as never before, and there is this huge link-up to casino capitalism in Australia and elsewhere. I point out to those people who think that compulsory superannuation is the trick that it also links us to the new international casino capitalism. Those seem to be the kinds of questions that are not being asked: how vulnerable have we become, and how have we never sat back and worked out at what level Australia still has some say?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the government seems to have been giving us arguments that we can use our exports to trade ourselves out of trouble. But we can look at that only if we forget about the fact that we quite clearly, over more than one year, have been running balance of trade deficits. The situation is getting worse&mdash;about $2 billion a month, which is far more than the government ever said we were likely to make in five years time as a result of us getting into this new international trade regime under the Uruguay Round of GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How the heck do we trade ourselves out of a growing current account deficit when our level of trade on imports is greater and growing in relation to our exports? Just how much beef can we produce? Just how many woodchips can we make out of our precious old-growth forests? Just how can we trade ourselves out of this situation in the way we are when we are not seeing the connections between our financial sectors, our trade and our lack of industry policy? When we have higher interest rates, it makes it more attractive to borrow overseas and more attractive for overseas investors to lend here.

At the invitation of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), the defence subcommittee attended Exercise Kangaroo 95 between the dates I have just given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kangaroo 95 was the major Australian Defence Force combined and joint exercise for 1995. The exercise concept involved the further testing of Australia's strategy of defence in depth by exercising elements of the Australian Defence Force in northern Australia in a short warning conflict scenario. It was designed to emphasise the joint nature of operations at the operational and tactical levels of war and to further develop the procedures required for civil-military cooperation during short warning conflict in the defence of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enemy forces in the exercise were drawn from the fictitious island nation of Orangeland. Under the exercise scenario, Orangeland mounted `Operation Trojan Horse' against Australia in order to obtain their rightful share of the region's non-renewable energy resources. This was a high profile, special operations group operation under the command of Headquarters 2nd Division, supplemented by elements from the Royal Australian Navy, army and Royal Australian Air Force. At the height of the operation, the effective strength of the Orangeland forces was approximately 1,625. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kangaroo 95 ran for over seven months, from mid-January to the end of August 1995, and was perhaps the longest and most complex exercise ever undertaken by the Australian Defence Force. The area of operations spanned a land area from Derby in the west to Cairns in the east, traversing three state/territory jurisdictions and encompassing large areas of international and territorial waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence elements of seven nations were involved in Kangaroo 95 in varying degrees, with foreign contingents being from the United States, United Kingdom, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Papua New Guinea. Some 18,000 navy, army and air force personnel were involved with around 16 ships and 110 aircraft. Direct expenditure is expected to be in the order of some $64 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subcommittee's visit commenced at HMAS Cairns with a briefing on the operations of the base, despite it being outside the area of operations. The subcommittee was flown by a RAAF HS748B to Weipa where 2 Royal Australian Regiment, 51 Far North Queensland Regiment, 10 Joint Force Support Unit and the Navy Mine Clearance Unit were deployed. We visited the Comalco bauxite mine, a key defence priority in the Weipa area, and observed amphibious operations on board HMAS Tobruk. I would have to say that trying to maintain defence and protection for the Comalco mine at Weipa is a monumental task and it was very interesting to see the large area that has to be covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subcommittee then flew to Darwin for a briefing on the objectives and overall progress of the exercise, followed by a visit to headquarters northern command, the joint headquarters of the Australian Defence Force in the area of operations. At the invitation of the Honourable Mr Gary Punch MP, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, we also attended the Official Opening of the Defence Force Careers Reference Centre in Darwin. The final leg of our visit was to the Orangeland headquarters in Nabarlek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit, though brief, impressed upon the subcommittee the significant impact that a well-armed and organised aggressor could inflict in northern Australia, as well as some of the fundamental difficulties faced by the Australian Defence Force in operating in the north. These difficulties range from severe climatic conditions to the sheer enormity of northern Australia and the wide variety of terrain in which the Australian Defence Force must operate. Members certainly appreciated the difficulties encountered in moving troops and supplies in such conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subcommittee met a diverse cross-section of uniformed personnel from the three services on its visit to Kangaroo 95. The subcommittee was able to hear of some personnel problems in the Australian Defence Force, including problems caused by repeated separation within service families. In particular, the subcommittee was advised that stress and family-related problems exist in the 51 Far North Queensland Regiment due to insufficient manning levels in the regiment's Q stores. The subcommittee recommends that the effectiveness of present arrangements be investigated to determine whether additional Australian Regular Army personnel should be recruited to support the 51 FNQR Q stores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subcommittee was told that the presence of service personnel in northern Queensland had resulted in a number of marijuana finds. While this is to be commended, the subcommittee was concerned about the lack of an Australian Federal Police presence north of Cairns. Currently, the 51 Far North Queensland Regiment conducts significant surveillance work on behalf of Commonwealth agencies such as the Australian Federal Police, AQIS, Customs and Immigration. The location of some of these Commonwealth agencies in the far north Queensland area would not only assist 51 FNQR's operations but would also enhance the level of protection and service in this remote area. Consequently, the subcommittee recommends that an Australian Federal Police presence be established on Thursday Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity to observe amphibious operations on board HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS> was an important aspect of the subcommittee's visit. The subcommittee had some concerns about the impact of the decision to proceed with the paying off of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS> on the amphibious capability of the Royal Australian Navy. HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS> is to be replaced by two training helicopter support ships, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kanimbla</EMPHASIS> and HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manoora</EMPHASIS>, which were acquired from the United States Navy. Both of these replacement vessels are about 10 years older than HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS>. The subcommittee is more inclined to the view that HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS> should be retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exercise Kangaroo 95 provided the Australian Defence Force with the opportunity to test command and control structures in joint operations in northern Australia. The subcommittee was told that the strategic planning for Kangaroo 95 identified the need for a lead joint commander. This resulted in the appointment of the air commander as the lead joint commander prior to the start of the exercise. In this capacity, the air commander was responsible to HQADF for achieving the exercise objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commander northern command, the joint commander of specified navy, army and air force units in the area of operations, reported to the lead joint commander in the event that he wished to utilise units outside of his direct control. However, the commander flotillas, commander of the Amphibious Task Group in the area of operations, did not report to the commander northern command but to the maritime commander who in turn reported directly to the lead joint commander. The subcommittee considers this command and control structure to be particularly unwieldy. Its inadequacies were demonstrated by the inability of the Australian Defence Force to co-ordinate reaction to exercise events in the Torres Strait. This points to the advantage of a single command and control structure incorporating one joint commander in the area of operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subcommittee's visit to Kangaroo 95 also highlighted the lack of air mobility in the army, especially given the recent grounding of the Nomad aircraft and problems with the Black Hawk helicopters. The lack of airborne and early warning control aircraft was also a concern as some penetrations of Australia's airspace by Orangeland forces went undetected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subcommittee was impressed by the Australian Defence Force's high level of awareness of the environment and the hazardous tropical conditions of the area of operations. Examples included the presence of non-camouflaged portaloos, the issue of bush hats to subcommittee members, the advice received to drink water at regular intervals and the precautions taken to ensure that water was carried at all times. Moreover, an environmental awareness and health handbook had been prepared which recognised that the unique environment, fragile infrastructure and sensitive heritage areas of northern Australia require careful protection in both the defence and environmental contexts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subcommittee was informed that all landholders, including indigenous landowners, in the area of operations had been consulted by the ADF. This resulted in some areas being declared off limits to the exercise due to tribal, environmental or other concerns. Overall, the general response to the exercise from landholders and the northern Australia community was very positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another pleasing aspect of the subcommittee's visit was the strong integration of women into the Australian Defence Force and the demonstrable recognition of the positive role they played in the exercise. Indeed, throughout the visit we were highly impressed by the professionalism, dedication and enthusiasm of the members of the Australian Defence Force, including members of the Reserves, for the tasks and responsibilities which were entrusted to them. The subcommittee looks forward to a full briefing on the outcomes of Kangaroo 95 and the report of the Australian Defence Force on its own debriefing on the exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude, I say that there is a dissenting report from one senator. We find that to be most regrettable. This report is a report of our visit, the commentary, the information provided to us and what we observed while we were there. To comment on protests and other things that may have taken place before and after our arrival and about which we were given no information I think is a little bit beyond the realms of what this committee report was supposed to encompass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I publicly express our appreciation for the opportunity to attend Exercise Kangaroo 95 and for the efforts of those who contributed to the success of our visit. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

That also occurred at Nabarlek in the field with the Orange forces&mdash;if you like, the enemy&mdash;where we were certainly briefed by General McGrath and his officers, and then back in Darwin where we visited the new Robertson Barracks, where there was a command post exercise being conducted with Singaporean and Malaysian troops. We were also given a Norcom briefing and an intelligence briefing in Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our visit extended over some four days and was very comprehensive. I know that my colleague Mr Taylor, because of knowledge he gained as a former senior naval officer, had a number of criticisms with regard to the area. He certainly made those comments well known and they are borne out in this particular report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my own point of view, being a senator for the Northern Territory, I can certainly comment on the validity and the value of exercise Kangaroo 95 for this particular year. As Senator West has mentioned, over 17,000 troops participated in the exercise. That participation included not only the efforts of Australian nationals but also the cooperative efforts, in various aspects of the exercise, of troops from the United States, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. All participation was invaluable, and I am sure that all participants learned very special lessons from that particular exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the conduct of an exercise such as this there is a commercial advantage to regions like the Northern Territory and North Queensland; I think from memory the cost of putting it on exceeded some $65 million. The value that then has to be measured to the Australian Defence forces is one that is naturally vitally important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that on this occasion we had the participation of troops from Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. It is only by developing these very special relationships of good neighbourliness with our near neighbours that we are able to secure the future not only in the immediate term but also for the long term. I look forward to seeing the final reports of this particular exercise&mdash;and I am sure that there will be many lessons learned from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my own point of view, I was certainly vastly impressed with the use of modern technology by the military in this particular exercise. More particularly, I was fascinated at the use of computer equipment and communications equipment which was far beyond the scope of anything previously appreciated by me as existing and being available to Australia; I am certain that in the development of those areas this technology is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, by staging an exercise such as this in northern Australia, there are important implications for the fields of development of both education and health services. The conduct of an exercise such as this in tropical north Australia poses many problems for Defence, and I am sure that there will be many lessons learned from that aspect of the exercise. The area of education, of course, has wider implications for people who live in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of what I saw on this exercise, I have proposed that there ought to be a much closer working relationship between the Australian Defence Force Academy here in Canberra and the various tertiary courses that are available through the military&mdash;whether they be in military studies; intelligence areas; health related fields, particularly tropical medicine; or in the provision of tertiary studies to so many of the members of the Australian Defence forces who will be located in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that already the comments I made at the time of the exercise have met with a warm response from senior Defence officers who have been to see me. I have been consulted by the Australian Defence Force Academy, and the Northern Territory University has expressed quite considerable interest in the various opportunities that arise in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can certainly see the immediate results of exercise Kangaroo 95&mdash;as they existed within the community with regard to the improvement of relationships between the Defence Force and the wider Australian community on the ground; the involvement of so many Aboriginal participants, not only in the military but also in cooperative arrangements with this particular exercise; and those opportunities that I have mentioned which will now naturally flow to defence, health, education and other government agencies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a member of the committee group that travelled to northern Australia to witness Kangaroo 95, or aspects of it. At this stage I would express my thanks to Lieutenant Colonel Mark Lippeatt who was our escorting officer. If not for the work of Mark Lippeatt, we may well have missed most of Kangaroo 95 inasmuch as when we went to Cairns we found that the exercise was not there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, we were to go to Thursday Island but, due to an aircraft accident and the fact that the war games had moved on from that point, we were to move to Weipa instead. But there had been no arrangement for us to be briefed on the overall arrangement involved with Kangaroo 95. That would have meant we would have gone all the way to Darwin&mdash;that is, the last one-third of our observation of Kangaroo 95&mdash;without understanding what it was we were looking at in terms of the rationale of how it was organised. That was unfortunate and, as I say, thanks go to Mark Lippeatt for his efforts there in perhaps turning around an otherwise pointless two-thirds of our trip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been mentioned that there is a dissenting report&mdash;and the dissenting report is mine. Members of the committee would be, and could be, in little doubt that I have a different viewpoint to theirs in relation to Australia's military involvement with some overseas forces that have been involved with human rights abuses in their own countries. I believe that just about every other speaker in the House of Representatives has taken the opportunity to have a go at me in relation to writing the dissenting report. Senator West has mentioned that she believes we should have put in the report only what we observed. I am just wondering how much it takes before people really do see; what does it take?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, in surveys over half the Australian population has indicated that they are concerned about Indonesia's occupation of East Timor, and Australia's part in recognising Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor and largely ignoring the human rights abuses that are occurring there. That huge level of public concern, of course, is impacted by such things as the inviting of an elite force from Indonesia&mdash;a force which has been known to be involved with East Timorese human rights abuses&mdash;to be part of a major Australian Defence military exercise. What does it take for a Defence subcommittee to see that actions by Australian Defence upset a number of people in the Australian public?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been mentioned that there were demonstrations in Darwin&mdash;and, yes, none of the other committee members attended those demonstrations. I was invited to attend the demonstrations by the organisers, but it has been suggested by some members of the committee that I may have been the cause of them. Oh, to have that much power!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of community concern exists. There is a large population&mdash;or relatively large, for its number&mdash;of East Timorese in Darwin. We are talking about people who have witnessed members of their families disappearing, being taken away or killed in front of their eyes. To suggest that I or any other individual would be responsible for that level of concern and outrage at Australia's military involvement in terms of the Kangaroo 95 exercise is bizarre. To suggest that those pieces of information given to us by the Australian military during those exercises are the only ones relevant to be mentioned in a report of Kangaroo 95 is also bizarre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder how many members of the defence committee have ever spoken or accepted invitations to speak with representatives of the peace, social justice and aid groups who are concerned about exercises like Kangaroo 95? If the message is, `They did not hear about it, therefore it does not exist,' then perhaps the aid groups, social justice groups, human rights groups, peace groups and community groups in and around Darwin should make sure that they put their information and their concerns to committees like the defence committee. They should not just assume they are going to ignore it. They should make sure those members of the committee receive information about the concerns because then they will have no excuse whatsoever to say that those levels of concerns do not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can have 10,000 people in the streets in Western Australia protesting about woodchips and there will still be people who say, `This is just a minority.' The number of people protesting in the streets or asked what they think about a particular issue does not necessarily relate to the level of concern; yet we appear to be blinkered on this. If I am a member of a committee and I have a differing viewpoint from the majority of the committee, does that mean my views are not relevant and should not be mentioned in the report? I believe I am representing a substantial number of people in the community&mdash;people who otherwise, in a committee such as the defence committee, would not get a voice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of those people, nearly everybody mentioned the fact that they knew I was involved in a demonstration outside Larrakeyah Barracks. That is true. But the fact that they knew I was involved in a demonstration with those groups of people who invited me to participate indicates that they did hear about the level of community concern. The fact that they complained that I went along to the demonstration obviously is proof that they did know there was community support; yet, even though it was mentioned in the local newspaper&mdash;and the national media, as far as I could see&mdash;they chose to close their eyes to that, to pretend that did not exist and to mention only those levels of community participation and support for the exercise that they were advised to by the military. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously during such an observation of a military exercise we do not have a number of people from a number of different community sectors invited to the exercise to give their opinions about how they feel about that. It is not like a normal hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we do know from the EPAC survey earlier this year before the budget is that a number of people in Australia are suggesting that the level of expenditure on defence could be cut relative to areas they think are more important, such as the environment. That is what the community says on a number of issues. Is the amount of money we spend on an exercise like Kangaroo 95 justified? On what basis is it justified? Those are the kinds of questions asked by the majority of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact they are not highly advised on the details of military exercises and so on would indicate that it is often quite difficult to get information about that. I know, because I am on the defence committee and I cannot get as much information about much of what Defence is spending than most people in the defence industry. That is the reality in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those levels of community concern exist. They are concerned about what we are spending, how we are spending it and how defence policy interacts and does not interact with other areas such as foreign affairs and human rights. I do not believe you have a leg to stand on if you say, `If I mention human rights abuses, it has nothing to do with defence.' If defence policies are seen or perceived to be giving the wrong signal in terms of human rights, then there is a link with defence and therefore we have the right&mdash;in fact, I feel obliged&mdash;to mention those issues when it comes to talking about such things as Australia's organisation of a major military exercise like Kangaroo 95. </PARA>

In fact I thank her for doing so because I believe that is a very important role, particularly in debates about defence. It is so difficult in this nation to really get any alternative opinions on this area of our life. The problem is the government and the major opposition are so often totally in agreement about their support for the defence forces that they cannot see there is a large body of opinion in this nation which has another point of view.

Interestingly enough, a number of them said things like, `Kangaroo 89 ensures your right to disagree, but if we had our way we'd stop your protest.' That is the kind of confusion people have when others want to dissent about such operations. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 to provide an appropriation of $83,636,000 for the 1996 calendar year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act appropriates funding for the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program through which the Commonwealth provides supplementary funding to State and Territory Governments, non-government school systems and education institutions, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education consultative bodies to advance the education of indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding under the act is appropriated on a triennial calendar year basis, with the current triennium due to finish at the end of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government intends to make major changes to the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program from January 1997, with a new funding triennium to commence at that time. Those changes will provide for a more equitable basis for the distribution of funds on a per capita basis and new accountability arrangements that focus on achieving improved educational outcomes for indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To allow time to implement these substantial changes, 1996 will be used as a transitional period. Funding at existing levels is therefore required for the 1996 calendar year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is an important element of the government's long-term strategy to improve education opportunities and outcomes for Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. It is therefore timely to review that strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1989, under Commonwealth leadership, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy was agreed by all governments. It provides a shared framework to the year 2001 for collaborative strategies to achieve equity of educational opportunity and outcomes for indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many factors contribute to educational disadvantage for indigenous people. Education systems may not adequately accommodate students' cultural backgrounds. People in remote communities can have limited access to quality educational facilities and teachers. Many indigenous children have special learning needs because English is not their first language. Poverty limits the ability of many indigenous people to participate in education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In late 1993 the Commonwealth appointed an independent Reference Group to examine the effectiveness of strategies developed in the first triennium of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy. This National Review of Education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples reported in late 1994 that there had been broadly based improvements in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education since the policy was implemented. For example, between 1989 and 1993 the percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students staying on to Year 12 of school increased from 14% to about 33%. During the same period, the number of indigenous people attending university doubled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the National Review also found that, despite these encouraging improvements, indigenous people remain the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. From preschool to higher education, Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders participate and attain significantly less in education than the rest of the community. For example, at primary school level, three times as many indigenous students have literacy and numeracy problems as do other primary students. Although the proportion of indigenous students studying to Year 12 has, as I have indicated, increased significantly in recent years, it is still less than half the rate for Australian students as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such continuing disadvantage is unacceptable and requires action from all governments. This government has taken the lead to accelerate efforts to achieve educational equity for indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sponsored by the Commonwealth, the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA) agreed in November 1994 to establish a taskforce to develop a national strategy to improve indigenous education outcomes. This taskforce will make its final report to State, Territory and Commonwealth Ministers later this year on the proposed strategy, which will include action on those National Review recommendations that are directed to State and Territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to report that at the May 1995 MCEETYA meeting, State and Territory Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the goals of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy, and acknowledged the need for more effort to achieve equity in educational outcomes for indigenous Australians by the turn of the century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My colleague, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Simon Crean has already arranged bilateral discussions with each State and Territory to translate this acknowledgment of need into increased practical effort. Once specific financial arrangements have been agreed, the Commonwealth will formally respond to the National Review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has already foreshadowed, in the recent Budget, its willingness to increase substantially its funding support over the next four years, as part of our response to the National Review, contingent upon States and Territories also increasing their effort.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That extra Commonwealth funding would be directed to priority areas across the range of programs through which this government fulfils its commitments to indigenous education.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ABSTUDY provides means-tested income support and other financial assistance to enable students to complete secondary education and progress to tertiary education. In 1994, Commonwealth funding of $114 million assisted some 44,000 students.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal Education Direct Assistance Program provides tutorial and vocational guidance support for, and encourages parental involvement in, students' education. Indigenous students needing special assistance can be individually tutored or attend centres that provide assistance in completing homework assignments. School-based parent committees are supported to participate in educational decision-making and to undertake activities that encourage indigenous students to engage in schooling. The program also funds activities to help indigenous students make informed choices about future education and career options. Over $49 million has been appropriated for this program in 1995/96.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Support funding for Higher Education institutions contributes to strategies to increase indigenous people's tertiary education participation and attainment. Over $14.5 million was provided for this purpose in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program (AESIP), which is funded by this act, assists education providers to meet the specific needs of indigenous students at the institutional level. It supports initiatives such as the development of culturally appropriate curricula and the employment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education workers who provide a supportive role model for indigenous students and act as a link between the family, the community and the school. Over $83 million is provided by the Commonwealth for this program each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I indicated at the outset of this speech, this bill provides for the continued operation of AESIP during the 1996 transitional year. Further legislation will be introduced next year to implement the changes to the program for the 1997-1999 triennium that are being developed as part of the Commonwealth's response to the National Review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also transfers $0.54 million per year from 1 July 1995 from this appropriation to the Department of Communications and the Arts to part-fund the establishment of the National Institute of Indigenous Performing Arts Training. This honours a commitment in the 1994 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Creative Nation</EMPHASIS> Statement to the preservation and promotion of indigenous cultures. As funding for the new Institute is being provided from July 1995, the AESIP appropriation for 1995 is reduced by $0.27 million.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 (the act) to implement decisions made by the government in respect of higher education and to make minor policy and technical changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill's provisions amend section 17 of the act to adjust funding for operating grants to reflect the major research facilities program and to provide supplementation for 1994, 1995 and 1996 price movements. Supplementation for price movements is also provided for superannuation expenses, teaching hospitals and special capital projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various provisions of the bill should be seen in the context of the government's overall policy directions for higher education. In particular, as confirmed in the recent budget, the government remains committed to a large, accessible, diverse and innovative system of publicly funded higher education. This bill underpins that objective by, for example, providing new and additional support for innovations in open learning and educational technology, enhancing the opportunities for universities to offer student places funded jointly with industry, and improving the detailed operations of the higher education contribution scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes substantial improvements to the open learning initiative. The two main elements of the open learning initiative are the Open Learning Agency of Australia (OLAA), an independent open learning organisation, and the development of an open learning electronic support service (Open Net). In addition to rolling over unused funding from 1994-95 to 1995-96, the amendment to the act will provide for the extension of the open learning initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Open Net provides teaching and learning assistance to enrolled students of OLAA, allowing students to communicate with tutors and other students by e-mail and through bulletin boards, to transfer assignments and access electronic library services and other national and international information resources through the internet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the immense benefit that open net can offer to a range of students, the act will be amended to extend open net services to additional nominated client groups, potentially including other higher education, TAFE and school students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The official launch of open net in may was an important step in realising the potential benefits of new technologies for australian higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Open Net is the first step in the establishment of the recently announced Education Network Australia (EDNA) which in itself is part of a broader national strategy to enable Australia to adopt new information and communications services and technologies&mdash;the so called information superhighway. Key objectives of EDNA are to maximise the use of new communications technologies, to improve the quality of learning in the education and training sectors and to maximise industry development of opportunities for Australians. The initiative has the potential to make a major contribution to equity in educational opportunity across the country. The expansion of the coverage of open net is an important step in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role that new technology is playing in the education and training sector is evident in another aspect of the bill. The bill provides the statutory framework and funding arrangements for the Co-operative Multi-media Centres (CMC) program announced by the prime minister in his cultural policy statement creative nation. This statement addressed the challenge of creating "a dynamic Australian multi-media industry providing australian content for australian and international consumers". The CMC initiative was announced to address the identified need to build a critical pool of talent with multi-media skills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objective of the program is to support the development of a competitive, internationally successful, Australian multi-media industry. It is intended to bring together a wide range of people, organisations and resources in order to meet the challenge of the multi-media industry's skill requirements. The CMCs will catalyse the development of collaborative links between the education and training sectors and the industrial and creative communities. They will support multi-media skill formation while also bringing other benefits to those involved in producing and distributing multi-media.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To foster developments in multi-media, the government will seed the development of up to six CMCs over the next two years and will provide funding for the centres of up to $56.5 million over nine years. The CMCs will be collaborative enterprises between education and training centres, private industry organisations and the arts/cultural communities. The CMCs will also encourage co-operation in many areas including research and development, product distribution, management of intellectual property and sharing of access to equipment and facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important aspect of the government's higher education policy is to encourage productive interactions between higher education institutions and industry across all fields. To this end the joint commonwealth/industry funded additional places scheme was established in the 1991 budget as a partnership between the government and industry. The objectives of the scheme are to provide additional places in higher education institutions and to encourage linkages with industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under existing program arrangements the commonwealth contributes 60 per cent of the cost of a place and industry the remaining 40 per cent. Approximately 20 per cent of the cost is returned to the commonwealth by way of HECS. In 1994 the program generated an additional uptake of 868 new places; 74 per cent of places under this scheme were filled by students selected by their employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is keen to build on this success and is revising the program's guidelines to introduce greater flexibility for institutions and industry partners. Part of these changes is to enhance the choices available in relation to hecs charges for students in joint commonwealth/industry funded places. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present all places under the scheme are HECS liable. Section 35 of the act is amended by this bill to allow a HECS exemption for students occupying places under the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new arrangements institutions would have the discretion to deem students HECS exempt where employers wish to pay 60 per cent of the cost of a place&mdash;that is, including the equivalent of the students' HECS charge. The commonwealth's contribution will remain at 60 per cent. In such cases the commonwealth would require institutions to remit the equivalent of the HECS charge. This will not result in an increase in the cost to the commonwealth and industry will contribute a greater proportion of the cost of the HECS exempt places. As a consequence there will be no net loss of commonwealth revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment to the scheme will provide greater flexibility to institutions in providing courses at times and under arrangements that are more suited to the needs of industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other minor changes, section 3 of the act is amended to rectify an anomaly by removing the reference to TAFE in the definition of a "course of study".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the act to extend the capacity of the secretary to remit a student's HECS debt to cover the period after an appeal has been lodged with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), where additional information has been provided by the applicant. This will provide a more timely service that benefits both the government and the student, by reducing the need for AAT hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the bill make a number of minor amendments including an amendment to section 110 of the act to remove references to obsolete provisions. The bill also makes a minor amendment to section 43 to provide that applications for tax file numbers must be lodged directly with the Australian Taxation Office and can no longer be lodged at institutions. As the commissioner of taxation has responsibility for issuing tax file numbers for administrative reasons it is appropriate for applications for tax file numbers to be made directly to that office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill reflects this government's commitment to an internationally recognised, high quality, higher education system which is striving for excellence and innovation in teaching and research&mdash;a system which is accessible to all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill 1995. The provisions of this bill mirror changes made to the Social Security Act by the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995. In the speeches I gave during the debate on those two bills a couple of weeks ago, I clearly stated the position of the Australian Democrats on the provisions contained in this bill. So I do not intend to take up the time of the Senate going over those provisions again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first comment I would make on this legislation, however, is that this is the first amendment bill we have seen to the recently renamed Student and Youth Assistance Act. As I have said, the amendments in this bill are identical to amendments contained within the social security bills we dealt with in the last sitting week. The reason for that is that, against the wishes of the Australian Democrats, the youth training allowance was established under DEET legislation rather than simply being incorporated into the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed in the House of Representatives debate that the shadow minister for employment and training, Dr Kemp, complained of the added complexity of having to deal with amendments to two separate acts. Of course, I fully agree with him, but I cannot let the shadow minister's comments pass without noting that, at the same time the youth training allowance was introduced, the Democrats pointed out to both the government and the opposition that, by having the YTA set up under DEET legislation, we were introducing unnecessary complexity into the system. It is added complexity for us as legislators; it is added complexity for the many community legal and welfare rights centres trying to advise their clients; and it is added complexity for the millions of people whose payments are governed by these acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Dr Kemp quite rightly pointed out in the House of Representatives debate, the only reason the youth training allowance was established under employment, education and training legislation was as a result of a power struggle between DEET and DSS. What he failed to mention was that the opposition allowed this to happen. I can only reiterate the Democrats' belief that the youth training allowance should be incorporated into the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage. That amendment is identical to an amendment that I moved last year to a student assistance bill. The aim of that amendment is to exempt the value of farm assets from the Austudy assets test.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the amendment will actually do is simply increase the current 50 per cent discount allowed for farm assets to 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since moving my amendment last year, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee has completed its inquiry into the impact of the Austudy assets test on farming families and has presented its final report to the Senate. That inquiry was held over eight months and received high quality submissions from hundreds of concerned groups and individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence given to the inquiry by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy showed that, as a result of the assets test, around 5,400 students from farming families are being denied access to Austudy. The fact that the assets test was discriminatory to farming families was noted by the committee which, in its conclusions, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee . . . considers that the assets test applied to farming families in order to determine eligibility for AUSTUDY, is an inappropriate policy instrument that does not take into account the nature of farm assets and their relationship with income. In essence, the current assets test does not acknowledge that some farmers are assets rich but income poor and that farm assets cannot readily be liquidated without diminishing the viability of the farming unit.</PARA>
<PARA>They are very wise comments by that committee. They are to be commended for the decision that they made which was recorded in that report. At the end of that eight-month inquiry, the majority recommendation of the committee was that farm assets should be excluded from the Austudy assets test. This is precisely what my amendment will achieve, and I will be calling on all senators to support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to speak in support of the coalition's amendments which have been circulated. The Student and Youth Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Bill proposes to change the youth training allowance provision in the Student Youth Assistance Act 1973. This allowance provides income support for young unemployed people under 18 years. The effect of this bill is to replace the jobsearch allowance administered by the Department of Social Security with the youth training allowance to be administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The payment agency for the youth training allowance will remain as the Department of Social Security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that this bill makes some cumbersome amendments in this area of administration. We should remember that this bill and the original act provide only a form of training allowance. They certainly do not make provision for real jobs for our youth. I have a real concern that another major portfolio area&mdash;DEET&mdash;has been brought into this process of administering these benefits. It seems to be more empire building on DEET's part. It increases the complexity of the youth training allowance and makes it harder for younger disadvantaged people to access benefits and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no convincing justification in the debate on this bill to date to support bringing DEET into the delivery of this scheme. Over the years DEET has become a huge bureaucratic monster. It has 16,000 staff, administering volumes of complex regulations. Clients, employees and DEET staff are confused. We believe that this bill will only add to the complexity of the whole process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the hearings we had earlier this year on Austudy&mdash;we made recommendations of 22 changes&mdash;we did not in that whole process of receiving evidence about DEET's administration of that program gain a lot of confidence that would indicate that on this occasion what has been proposed here will actually improve the situation. We believe that the government has failed to perform and deliver effective training as promised by Labor through these programs. The scheme has not delivered its job creation targets because the training is really not relevant to available employment needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr David Kemp, who is our shadow minister, has exposed the government's fraud of concealing the real story on employment numbers. Youth unemployment in this country is running at nearly 30 per cent. In many regional areas the unemployment figure is an appalling 50 per cent, and that is certainly the case in my own area in the Hunter and to the north on the far north coast. Many of these 15- to 18-year-olds are long-term unemployed. Labor have deliberately reclassified and hidden 70,000 of the 140,000 people on the long-term lists. They put long-term unemployed, including our youth, into 13-week training programs. These labour market programs still leave three out of five people out of work when the program is completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into long-term unemployment heard evidence from young people that many of the training courses are irrelevant to their needs. Courses are often set up with a minimum of 20 participants and our youth are herded into them, irrespective of their interests or employment goals. It is little wonder that kids complain that only two or three of their number on the course were even interested in that particular area. They say that they are sick and tired of having to sit around and do courses to meet the targets of DEET officials. As clients, it seems that their real needs are secondary. At the end of these 13-week courses the majority not only do not get a job but they also lose their long-term unemployment status and they go back to the start of the queue again. In that process, they lose a lot of the assistance that people who have been classified for a longer period of time as long-term unemployed actually get. We feel that in many ways what has been set up under Working Nation with that sort of outcome is very much a retrograde step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The traineeship targets for Working Nation for 1994-95 will not even reach half the government's targets. Of 26,500 placements, only 9,000 had been achieved in 1994-95. The amendments and the continual changes to Working Nation and the youth training allowance, in particular, prove that the whole policy has been done on the run. The scheme has been painfully slow being cranked up to provide assistance to young people. Labor's dishonest rhetoric always says that the targets will be met next year. The reality is that the targets are not met and the numbers of training opportunities for the young have been reduced. So much for the so-called world-class labour market intervention programs of this Labor government, as claimed by the chair of the ALP caucus economics committee, Wayne Swan, the member for Lilley, when he opened the unemployment conference in Brisbane earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of young people moving into traineeships in 1994-95&mdash;the first year of Working Nation&mdash;will be lower than the year before Working Nation came into being. The ALP propaganda machine has spent millions reassuring the nation that youth traineeships are mounting and the process is speeding up. This line is totally without credibility. The machinery for operating the traineeship scheme has collapsed and the result is that the CES has botched the job of providing the promised effective training schemes. We believe that the logic of handing over the administration of the youth training allowance to DEET proposed by this bill is flawed and inappropriate. DEET and the CES have already dropped the ball on traineeships. The intent of the bill is to extend DEET's responsibilities. It will in no way guarantee an improvement in the job prospects for young people receiving the youth training allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of this government's approach to training has been identified for some time now. In June of this year Dr Vince Fitzgerald of the Allen Consulting Group wrote a report for ANTA. The report was highly critical of this government's approach to training. Minister Crean was so embarrassed that he hid the report until September for three months. The details of the report demolished the ALP's training credentials. Fitzgerald wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current approach to training reform will not, without change, bring about the desired outcomes . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing has changed. Our youth are churned through training schemes, whether they meet their needs or the needs of employers. Fitzgerald was saying that we must change our training ways away from government regulated courses. He argued that we should move to a more industry based model. This is the way forward in Europe and it certainly should be the way forward in Australia. Yet we persist with training people to go to the back of the unemployment queue, as I indicated earlier. Training schemes must be more tightly linked to industry and small business job opportunities. The coalition wants to be constructive in developing sensible and effective training for young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What future is this legislation offering? It is all about administrative change to the bureaucracy. It does not improve the nature of the training. We want training schemes to do this and to deliver real skills that will be provided for real jobs. We have a number of initial programs at work, more or less as pilot schemes, that do provide the way forward for the future. I refer particularly in my own area to the Hunter Valley Training Co. It is a fine model that has been emulated by a number of other areas and does provide this real link between real work and training. The TRAC scheme in the retail area, which was initially started in the Hunter, is another example. These are all models for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the coalition's amendments to this bill. These amendments have three important aims: firstly, they focus the government back to delivery of effective training programs; secondly, we want the government to clamp down on the expansion of this bureaucracy by DEET; and, thirdly, the amendments assure our young people that the coalition wants to see Labor's failed programs redesigned to give proper emphasis to industry based skills training. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make my contribution to this debate on the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill 1995. It makes various amendments to the Student and Youth Assistance Act to mirror amendments made to the Social Security Act 1991 resulting from the government's Working Nation initiatives. These include provisions dealing with the liquid assets waiting period, periodic compensation payments, lump sum compensation, debt recovery, disclosure of information, reviewability of ministerial decisions, deferment periods and waiting periods, payment of the youth training allowance to full-time students and loan fringe benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition opposes the provisions regarding disclosure of information and reviewability of ministerial decisions and supports the government's amendments to remove schedule 6, with the exception of item 7, and schedules 7 and 8. As part of Working Nation's youth initiative, the government introduced the Student Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill to implement the jobsearch allowance for under-18-year-olds. The youth training allowance is closely aligned to Austudy and is subject to means testing with parental income and assets tests being taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time I have been raising in the parliament the issue of access to Austudy for rural students. On a number of occasions the coalition has moved amendments relating to the health card. On occasions our amendments have had the support of the Democrats and no doubt they will support these amendments again. The issue came up some time ago when the government brought down the budget. Inadvertently, by mistake or by some reason or another, they did promise in their budget papers that the siblings or brothers and sisters of the breadwinner of any family who was eligible for health care cards would receive Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this commitment was made we raised the issue in the Senate, only to find that the government had made a mistake. They built up expectations among young rural people who were looking forward to having a tertiary education and who were being tricked out of Austudy by the $750,000 assets test. In rural communities at the moment there are many students whose parents would have assets totalling $750,000. Those parents would be receiving negative incomes because of the drought or, in the past, because of low commodity prices for wool. I would expect, now that most of the abattoirs have closed in Queensland, that there will be a cattle crunch which will deprive a lot of rural students of access to Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the coalition will be moving an amendment relating to the health care card issue, just as they have moved amendments previously when this legislation has been considered. I am hopeful that the government will support the amendment. I say `hope' rather than `expect' because the government has made a commitment. There is no doubt it has made a commitment. It acknowledges it has made a commitment to rural students, yet it has backed away not once, not twice, but on at least three or four occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that when the government introduced the drought relief package, that package made Austudy available to those people who were able to access that drought relief package. But there are many others who are not in receipt of the drought relief package&mdash;not so many in Queensland, but there are some in New South Wales and Victoria who are still subject to drought conditions and who are still unable to send their children to acquire a tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why I am fighting so hard for this amendment is that it is very difficult now for the smaller properties to survive. Whereas 6,000 sheep used to be the number from which a person could get a decent living, now it is probably 12,000. Wheat farms have to get bigger. In real terms, that means a lot of farmers' children have to leave the property because they can no longer obtain a living from the land. More and more children of farmers will have to leave the land and the only opportunity available to them is to obtain a tertiary education. Unfortunately, because of circumstances far beyond their control, their parents are not able to offer them access to Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real point is that they can no longer obtain a living from the family farm. The family farm is flat out trying to provide a living for the parents. In the old days, it was always the great wish of farmers to pass on the property or access another property for their children, just as their fathers gave them a property. Unfortunately, that is not the case now. Many families of farming parents have to move off the property. If they are not able to get a living from the family property, there is nowhere else for them to go except to obtain a tertiary education. They are now going to be deprived of that, unless our proposed amendment is carried. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment is designed to exempt the value of the family farm from the Austudy assets test. This is the same amendment I moved last year; indeed, the Democrats have been moving similar amendments for over four years now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to one of my amendments last year, a Senate inquiry was established to look into and report on the impact of the Social Security and Austudy assets test on farming families. I certainly would like to recognise the involvement of my colleague Meg Lees in getting that reference up, as well as the involvement of Senator Patterson. So we had this inquiry. I was a member of the committee of inquiry. It was held over eight months. It received more than 250 submissions and the overwhelming majority of those were highly critical of the assets test as it applied to farming families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee presented its report relating to the Austudy assets test to the Senate in March this year. The inquiry found that around 5,400 students from farming families are being denied Austudy because of the assets test. The inquiry also found general agreement that retention and participation rates of rural students are much lower than in the rest of the community. The committee pointed out that it is in the national interest that farming families have access to educational opportunities in order for this productive sector to remain competitive and technologically innovative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major recommendation&mdash;let me underline this&mdash;supported by the Democrats, the Greens, Senator Harradine, the National Party and the Liberal Party, was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that farm assets be excluded from the Austudy assets test.</PARA>
<PARA>A very, very important recommendation. Children from farming families deserve and have a right to receive the same level of government encouragement and support to continue their studies that city kids enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average value of a broadacre farm is around $900,000. In each of the past three years, however, Australian broadacre farmers have reported average losses of around $17,000, $6,000 and, for 1994-95, $13,500. Yet the majority of these farmers are ineligible to receive Austudy to assist in their children's education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The amendment will address this inequity. The amendment reflects the policy of the National Farmers Federation, the Victorian Farmers Federation, the majority of the 250 groups and individuals who gave evidence to the Senate inquiry and, I am sure, reflects the wishes of every farming family in Australia. Therefore, I commend the amendment to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to briefly respond to the amendment moved by Senator Woodley. This is, as he said, a debate that we have had on a number of occasions in recent years. Addressing the particular problems of rural people and ensuring they have fair access to education is an issue of concern certainly to the coalition parties in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our observation&mdash;and I am speaking generally&mdash;that rural children are at a disadvantage in terms of education. It is not surprising that the schools that offer the greater choice and greater depth and most of Australia's universities are located in either major cities or capital cities&mdash;most in fact are in capital cities. This creates problems when trying to ensure that a fair opportunity for education is given to children who live in regional or rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of different ways to address that problem and ensure that there is equity across the Australian community&mdash;but that is, in broad terms, a debate beyond the one we are having today. It is certainly a debate that the coalition does not shy away from, and it is one that we will be addressing as a major part of our rural and educational policies at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have to acknowledge that in recent years there has been another problem facing rural children&mdash;that is, rural families have suffered from the devastating effects of this prolonged drought which is affecting a great deal of Australia. I have witnessed the consequences of that suffering as I have visited those universities that do exist in regional Australia. The students have told me of the problems they have had when they have been unable to continue courses in universities, firstly, because of their responsibility to their family and because they have tried to keep the family income going and, secondly, simply because of the costs associated with getting to university and undertaking study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a general problem in this country&mdash;because of our geography and demographics, our country students are disadvantaged. In recent times, we have had a more particular problem, because so many of our rural families have suffered the detrimental consequences of the drought. This has added to the difficulties that those families have had in providing the sort of education they want for their children. As national legislators, we acknowledge that this is something we must address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also accept that there seems to be a trend that people in rural Australia have lower incomes. Others in this chamber from the Liberal Party and the National Party are probably better able to speak about the effects of commodity markets and consequences of low prices. I can certainly speak about all the unnecessary on-costs that farmers have to bear as a result of this incompetent Labor government. It has been the case that incomes of rural people in this country overall seem to be very low, and that has made the education of rural children even more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This gets us to the issue of Austudy. I think Senator Woodley will acknowledge that this is an issue that has been raised under the framework of this bill simply because it is convenient to do so&mdash;we have performed similarly with other student assistance bills in the past. Senator Woodley believes that, if we remove the asset study altogether for rural families, we can solve the problem of students missing out on Austudy because of the asset value of farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have addressed this in the past. We have addressed it in the committee to which Senator Woodley referred. We have a lot of sympathy with what he seeks to do, but we still have some reservations as to whether his solution is, in fact, the best solution in all the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a responsibility to be fair to communities living within rural Australia, whether they live in the towns or whether they earn their income from primary production. Senator Woodley's amendment, as I understand it, is limited to those who earn their income from primary production. I simply remind him that many small businesses in towns have been grossly reduced in value as a result of the drought and also because of the general difficulties in rural Australia. Some businesses have had their income reduced but would still have a value. Sometimes you wonder about the methods of calculating these values. Nevertheless, there are families who have missed out on Austudy because of the assets test applied to their business. We certainly hesitate before endorsing an amendment that would, in effect, divide rural Australia in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have some reservations about further dividing Australia between rural and non-rural. The whole issue of assets tests on Austudy is a difficult one. We understand the motivation for that test. Public funding is always tight, and at the moment it is particularly tight. But the future of this country very much depends upon the quality of education that can be given to all Australians, which includes those families suffering from low income who may miss out on that opportunity because they cannot be supported through Austudy as a result of the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have tried in the past to look for what we think is a fairer approach. The fairer approach we have endorsed in the past is to work off the health card system to which, as honourable senators know, there is not an assets test applied, only an income test. Certainly, in circumstances out of the ordinary where someone's income drops, such as in the case of a drought, the value of the supporting asset may remain up because people invest for the long term in the hope that the drought will eventually pass. Because of the low income during that period, we believe&mdash;and certainly know in many cases as a fact&mdash;that they have been able to access a health card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to us to be a fairer solution that, if those who are entitled to a health card as a result of their falling income were given the right to take Austudy without being subject to an assets test, that would achieve many of the objectives that Senator Woodley seeks without, it seems to us, creating further inequities within the community. In other words, it would not be discriminatory in the way that Senator Woodley's solution might be argued to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not say for a moment that this is a cut and dried issue. As I said at the outset, I think we all recognise a responsibility to these particular families in Australia who may be in need but who, nevertheless, fail the assets test. We also recognise our direct responsibility, our primary responsibility, to their children. But in our efforts to find the best solution in these circumstances, we believed in the past that the health card option better achieved that outcome, and that is still our opinion today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we will not support Senator Woodley's amendment. We will put the alternative of the health card amendment, which we have put previously in this place. We hope that, when we reach that stage of the debate, the Australian Democrats will recognise the merit of our proposal and will support us. In that way, we can offer some benefit to rural families that fall within the difficulties I have outlined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can argue whether it is the same or whether it does get us to the same position, but there is a lot of truth in what Senator Hill says. The health card amendment will assist the farmers and the graziers who are caught up in the downturn of commodity prices, the drought or the very high interest rates. Let me make this point: a lot of the farmers' woes are being blamed on the drought and low commodity prices. Farmers have always had to contend with drought and low commodity prices or price fluctuations, and they have always survived. By battening the hatches down and cutting their spending they have always been able to survive those two adversities that do affect farming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the main hurt that they have had to sustain is the 25 per cent interest rates that have eaten the equity out of their properties. We can blame commodity prices and we can blame the drought&mdash;and I am not denying that they are a big factor&mdash;but the biggest factor was the interest rates in the late 1980s which drained away the equity many property owners had in their property. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have sympathy with Senator Woodley's amendment but it does leave problems. I know Senator Woodley has written to every rural organisation asking them to put pressure on us to support his amendment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woodley and this side of the chamber support amendments that give rural students access to Austudy for many valid reasons. I alluded to them in my speech on the second reading. Farmers at the moment cannot afford to pass on a property as their parents passed the property on to them and their parents before them passed the property on to them. It has always been a tradition in the farming communities. If your parents gave you a property, it is incumbent upon you to give your sons, in particular, and daughters a property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the living areas of properties have to be extended. No longer does a small family farm provide an income. So these students and rural families have to leave the property. They have to seek employment in the cities or in other regional towns. The only way they are going to get employment is if they have the same choice as other low income families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What you are doing by not passing either of these amendments, Senator Sherry, is consigning those kids to second-rate jobs. Every child in Australia has the right to an education, but you are denying that right to rural families. The assets test is tripping up some of these families. As Senator Woodley said, a property worth $750,000 is not a huge property. I believe he used the figure of $900,000. I would have thought that was roughly accurate. </PARA>

Take the advice that we are offering and do not desert Senator Boswell, your own deputy leader, who was convinced by the inquiry we had and who was able, very tellingly, to change his mind and, as chairman of the committee, urged the exact amendment that I am now moving as a first step in dealing with the issue&mdash;which people in this chamber are very passionate about, I do not deny. I am appealing to the National Party because I am not sure I could convince the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to some of the issues that were raised. Senator Lees, who has a lot of experience in this area, will speak a little about some of them but let me make a quick comment on the issue of discrimination against, for example, small businesses in rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the committee of inquiry we were very aware of this issue&mdash;it was raised on many occasions&mdash;and we recommended that we have an inquiry into the larger problem of other businesses in rural communities. The Australian Democrats are ready to support immediately such an inquiry. I would support the bringing forward of terms of reference for that inquiry, and perhaps Senator Hill would be the appropriate person to initiate it, having raised that issue himself. I am sure he is fair dinkum about it and I look forward to the terms of reference that he will bring into the chamber so that we can deal with that issue. But that is only a first step in addressing the needs of people who are most obviously being disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quickly speak about the issue of the health care card because we have looked at this very carefully. There will be a significant number who would not benefit from the health care card amendment but would be greatly assisted by a 100 per cent discount of farm assets under the Austudy assets test. That is because the Austudy income test is far more generous than that which applies to the health care card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income test limits on the health care card allow a family with one child to earn up to about $19,400 a year, while a family with two children can earn up to about $21,200. However, these are sudden death thresholds, meaning that if the family earns $1 over the threshold, it receives no health care benefits at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The threshold for full rate Austudy is $21,300, but the payment has a gradual withdrawal rate of $1 for every $4 of income over the threshold. Further, the Austudy income test is based on what is known as adjusted family income, which allows additional concessions for other dependent children. So a farm family which, were it not for the assets test, would qualify for a part rate Austudy payment, will benefit from the 100 per cent discount amendment but will gain nothing from the health care card amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you an example. A farm family with two children on an income of $25,000 would not qualify for a health care card and would probably be excluded from Austudy. If the 100 per cent discount amendment were accepted, this same family would qualify for a part payment of Austudy of around $100 per fortnight if the student child were living at home, or $190 per fortnight if the student child were away from home. In summary, all farm families with incomes between $21,000 and around $45,000 would benefit from the 100 per cent amendment by receiving a part rate payment of Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let's not forget that the only reason these people are not currently getting Austudy is because of their farm assets. Most city families with incomes between $21,000 and $45,000 per year are already receiving part Austudy payments for their kids. So while the health care card amendment is certainly a valuable one, I believe, as a priority, the chamber should be supporting the 100 per cent discount amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would simply point out once again that the inquiry of the rural and regional affairs committee took over eight months and received submissions from over 250 people. The conclusion that committee came to was that the family farm should be exempted from the assets test. In the light of that, it seems strange that the opposition are so keen to pursue an amendment that is so clearly a second-best option. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the challenge to me personally, the facts of life are that I am a member of the party caucus.

Be that as it may, like other senators in this chamber&mdash;Senator Hill, Senator Boswell, Senator Woodley and a number of others who have expressed a view in this chamber&mdash;I tour rural areas very extensively. I am aware of some of the very difficult circumstances that exist in the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I get to Senator Woodley's amendment, Senator Boswell and Senator McGauran have raised what they argue is a specific commitment promise given by the government in the budget papers of 1993. Senator Boswell has tabled a document which is not the budget papers&mdash;I point out to the chamber&mdash;which is not legislation and which is not a government statement. It is a document issued by DEET called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">1993-94 Student assistance budget kit</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to this document&mdash;contrary to the assertion that there was any commitment given in the budget papers, which is the budget that is handed down by the Treasurer and the associated papers by the various ministers&mdash;is that there was no commitment to remove the assets test or to base it on the health care card. What we then had was a kit put out shortly thereafter&mdash;I do not know the precise date&mdash;which was incorrect. It certainly does refer to assets tests&mdash;`without parental income and assets test'. It does refer to that. That was an error. It was corrected straightaway. I do not know whether it was corrected on the same day, but it was certainly very shortly thereafter once the government had it drawn to its attention. It was corrected shortly thereafter because the kit that was issued was incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no government undertaking. There is no government budget paper, no government legislation, no government press release or no government campaign material that gave the promise that Senator Boswell refers to. There was no government undertaking that the assets test would be waived for health care card holders. There was an error, and it was corrected at the time by Minister Free. The document that Senator Boswell refers to, and that I was very happy for him to table, clearly indicates what I have said. So there is no need for me to fall on my sword or my pen. I think that the facts are very clear on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will not be accepting Senator Woodley's manedment. The Austudy assets test is there to ensure that assistance is targeted to those in greatest need. The assets test was introduced following community concern that income alone was not an adequate measure of the financial circumstances of families and their ability to contribute to their children's education. The assets test already provides a wide range of concessions which ensure it operates to target Austudy assistance fairly, most significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of assets is calculated based on current market value and net of debt. These are important concessions where the value of the family farm or other business is genuinely affected by market downturns, drought or high debt burdens. Recognising the special circumstances of assets that are tied up in a family business, a 50 per cent discount applies to the value of all family businesses which the parent is wholly or substantially engaged in operating, including family operated farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under special concessions for drought affected families, families in exceptional circumstance drought affected areas who are getting a Commonwealth drought relief payment through the Department of Social Security can get Austudy exempt from income or assets tests. Families in exceptional circumstance drought affected areas who do not get or choose not to apply for the drought relief payment can still get a 100 per cent discount on on-farm assets. So we have heard about and seen the difficult circumstances in the drought areas of Australia and that change has been provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Free in the House on 22 June this year drew attention to recent Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics figures, indicating that average farm values for most types of farms were within the limits allowed under the Austudy assets test. Senator Woodley's amendment seeks to apply a 100 per cent discount on farm primary production assets, which I notice is one of the reasons given by Senator Hill for not supporting this amendment. He has argued that it would discriminate against people who live in rural and regional Australia and who do not have on-farm production assets. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but you could then extend that logic further and say why discriminate at all against people who have assets in urban areas who may run similar types of businesses, other than farms, to people in regional Australia. I think you also base your argument on an inconsistent argument that would discriminate against people in urban areas who are earning similar incomes with similar or the same assets and businesses. Given the concessions to the assets test already in place, the benefits of this could flow to only farming families who are not in exceptional circumstance drought affected areas, particularly those with on-farm assets worth more than $750,000 clear of debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, Senator Woodley's amendment is limited to only on-farm assets, so families whose assets are tied up in a family business other than a farm&mdash;as I have already mentioned, Senator Hill has already dealt with this issue&mdash;would be treated differently. This includes shopkeepers and local business people. Why should we treat shopkeepers and local business people in rural and regional areas any differently from the small business people&mdash;those who you, Senator Boswell, talk in here about&mdash;who are in suburban Australia?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means Senator Woodley's amendment would be taken to have commenced from this date once the bill has received royal assent. However, regulations implementing the substantive provisions of this amendment would need to be made prior to the royal assent of the bill. It is inappropriate to hold up royal assent for this bill whilst regulations are made. This bill is about keeping the youth training allowance in line with legislative change that the Department of Social Security is making to other Commonwealth income support payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill is saying&mdash;we have already touched on this to some degree in this debate&mdash;to you, Senator Woodley, that he agrees with you but he is not going to support your amendment because the opposition are approaching the issue from a different tack. The opposition might reconsider their position when they disclose their currently secret policies, if they have them, some time up to the election. In the meantime, they are not going to support your amendment.

Looking at my home state in particular, we are not eligible for that. Senator Hill will support me in saying that, despite year after year of problem after problem, mice plagues do not come into the government's calculations when determining drought. Rain at the wrong time of the year which totally ruins harvests does not qualify us for drought. Forget about the fact that our farmers have had year after year with either low incomes, no incomes or negative incomes, not one farmer is able to take any benefit from the support the government is giving. I am very pleased to say the government is giving it to other states, but no farmers in my home state are able to access Austudy through that special drought relief provision. </PARA>

My explanation in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will explain it to you, Senator Ferguson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry challenged the Democrats about cost. During the hearings we were told that the cost of our amendment would be somewhere between $10 million and $15 million. In a previous debate tonight we saw that Kangaroo 95 cost in the vicinity of $64 million. Some of that money, of course, was used to teach Indonesians to kill their own citizens. I would suggest to you that Australians would much rather see $10 million or $15 million spent on what they would regard not as a cost but as an investment in the future of children of the farming families of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to be drawn into the debate, but a couple of things Senator Woodley and Senator Lees have said have forced me to. It has been very interesting to hear Senator Woodley, Senator Lees and Senator Bell get up and speak and purport to know exactly what people who live in rural communities require to further the education of their children. I happen to live in one of those communities and have first-hand knowledge of neighbours who started off getting support and then there was some alleged mistake made. They started getting support because they were in receipt of a health care card and then, all of a sudden, this was cut off because it was decided that it was a mistake in the first place and it had never been intended that health care card holders should be able to receive support through Austudy for their children's education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not agree with Senator Lees or Senator Woodley when they talk about a second-best option. The one thing people who are actually living in rural communities are most concerned  about&mdash;I can say this with first-hand knowledge, because I still do&mdash;is that there is no discrimination, amongst the people who receive support, from people within rural communities. Coming from a farming family myself, the thing that concerns me is: if this is offered only to children of farming families, what happens to the children of the families they live with in those rural areas who run the local machinery dealership, as was mentioned by, I think, Senator Hill, and the people who are running all the other small businesses within those rural communities who are suffering just as much as people who are under the direct effects of the drought by way of their personal income through primary production?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we have decided that we do not want to use just the farm assets test&mdash;it would be very easy for the Liberal and National parties to say that we will just support the farming family&mdash;is that there are more than farming families that need support. To discriminate amongst people who live in one small community is only going to cause divisions that are not warranted and are certainly not in the best interests of the children we are trying to help.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay. You supported that amendment before. You said that you brought the same amendment up three or four times. What I am saying to you, Senator Bell, is that the only fair way to do it is to have something that covers more than just farming families. As a former farmer myself, I know that within rural communities everybody suffers equally. It is not just those people who happen to be involved in primary production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unanimous decision by the two parties in the coalition is that we should look at supporting people other than just those that are working on farms. I may have something to say when our amendment comes up regarding the health care card, which we think is a far better option because it does cover all of those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I heard Senator Sherry saying, `What about small businesses in urban areas that are suffering because of a downturn in the economy?' The health care card option covers a far greater range of people and it does the thing we want to do; that is, provide equality of opportunity for all those young people who are looking to further their education in the way that suits them and their families best. For that reason, I do not support Senator Woodley's motion that only farming families should be considered and the farm assets should be considered. We should be looking at the broader rural communities and also at people who live in smaller urban areas who are suffering the same sorts of downturns. That is why the health care card is not the second-best option. It is the best option. </PARA>

She also raised a series of circumstances that, she argues, in South Australia have precluded or excluded rural families from receiving drought assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drought assistance is what it says: drought assistance. Certainly, we are all concerned about the impact of low commodity prices and their fluctuations on rural families. But that is not what the drought assistance package is for. It is not for mouse plagues&mdash;and we can regret that&mdash;but, primarily, it is based on rain criteria. If you want to argue that there should be a change on the basis of low commodity prices, then do it&mdash;but do not do it on the basis of drought. Low commodity prices certainly affect rural incomes, but drought policy is drought policy; that is, lack of rainfall. That is the policy we have applied consistently throughout Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect the reason for that is this: these bills that we have both attempted to tag amendments on have benefits to a number of other areas. The fact of the matter is that every time a bill able to carry an Austudy amendment is picked up by either the Democrats or the coalition, our amendments are tagged onto it. That particular bill to which the amendments are tagged on has benefits to other people. As I say, I suspect that this is what has happened.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Tuesday, 19 September 1995, Senator Chris Evans had something to say about the workplace agreements by the government of Western Australia. He reckons that he was looking into those agreements, which is basically the state government making enterprise agreements with its workers. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I came across some quite concerning information with implications for this parliament and for the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA>They are his words. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that as part of that approach the Western Australian government has come up with a concept called `flexible remuneration packaging'. At first sight that would not seem to be a particularly big deal. Many employers offer salary packaging; there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that provided appropriate taxation is paid.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those employees are allowed to sacrifice up to 30 per cent of their salary package. They can take their salary in other than cash benefits up to a maximum of 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>Then he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So how is it that this inducement can be offered and a supposed advantage flow to employees without any cost to that state government, the employer of these people? Simply put, it is because of tax evasion. The state government is encouraging the avoidance of payment of tax by its employees. It has erected a tax avoidance scam. The scheme induces employees out of their award system into the workplace agreement on the basis of helping them to avoid paying the appropriate tax on their incomes.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that senators would be interested and I interjected by asking him how it would be done, but he did not say anything. He said that it is quite blatant tax avoidance. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government are encouraging the avoidance of the payment of tax by their employees.</PARA>
<PARA>He finished by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is a very scandalous situation that we have a state government encouraging tax evasion. I know the federal coalition opposes the fringe benefits tax . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He uses all those sidelines which are not correct. I told him that at the time. Incidentally, I advised Senator Chris Evans that I would be bringing up this matter tonight in case he wanted to come down for some reason or other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I decided to go into the matter and find out why Senator Chris Evans believed the WA government was creating a tax evasion scheme. I have found out that the WA government, like all responsible state governments, will use any legal means possible to make taxpayers' dollars go as far as possible by minimising expenditure. The agreements Senator Evans referred to were prepared in line with current legislation of the Keating government. They were also checked by the Australian Taxation Office for full compliance before being brought into use and were found to conform totally to current tax law. Apparently other states have gone further in their interpretation of taxation laws, so WA is not alone in using this scheme of workplace agreements and making greater use of current tax provisions to maximum advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I would like Senator Evans&mdash;wherever he is&mdash;to listen to this: he should remember that that salary packaging was in fact pioneered by the Labor government's masters in the trade union movement. That is something he was unaware of. I though he might have known that, because he worked in the Fire Brigade Union. If he was aware of it, then I would like him to come down and apologise for misleading the Senate last Tuesday evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Senator Chris Evans: what was all the fuss about in your adjournment speech last week? It was union pioneered salary packaging carried out within the framework of laws which the majority of his colleagues and the Australian Taxation Office have supported. Senator Chris Evans, it is all legal; it is all aboveboard; it is saving taxpayers money. Senator Chris Evans should have been praising these commendable measures rather than accusing the WA coalition government, led by Mr Court, of being tax evaders. I would certainly like him to come down and apologise to the state government of Western Australia for his remarks and to the Senate for misleading it. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Coulter</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 6 September, with which Senators Spindler and Bell were also associated, concerning the reported use of United States air space by French supply flights associated with France's nuclear testing program in the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My information is that France now normally uses an all-French route (through the Caribbean) to transport nuclear material to Mururoa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that the three occasions referred to in your letter on which the United States allegedly refused overflight permission date back to the period of French atmospheric testing in the South Pacific. On these occasions, the French authorities apparently dismantled the aircraft which were to have been involved in the tests and transported them by sea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If France were for any reason to seek permission to overfly the US for purposes associated with its weapons testing program, and the US refused that permission, France could simply fall back on the all-French air route available to it: it would not need to revert to sending any material by sea, and no significant delay would be caused to its testing program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GARETH EVANS</PARA>
<PARA>I am not convinced that the minister's answer is properly informed. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS> magazine, which I quoted in question time today, took particular trouble to find information on this matter, including the fact that between 15 and 18 French military aircraft have been allowed to fly through American airspace on their way to the South Pacific since May. Also, it noted that three of those aircraft were carrying military equipment, although the French did not declare it as hazardous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's answer&mdash;both in the letter that he addressed to Senator Coulter and in the answer that he gave today&mdash;did not reveal his sources and did not reveal a rigorous questioning of the glib assurances that he has received. This matter deserves an aggressive and thorough questioning and pursuit. It is quite apparent to all who are interested in this topic that a vast majority of Australians demand strong Australian efforts and persistence with regard to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to know from the minister&mdash;as does the vast majority of Australians&mdash;whether the minister has asked whether there have been any flights through Guadeloupe, for example&mdash;the stopover point mentioned by the minister in his answer as being a likely all-French route. The majority of Australians need to know whether the minister has read the article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Le Monde</EMPHASIS> newspaper, to which I referred in my question, which asserts that the plutonium for the Mururoa bombs is flown over the US, although not in a single load. This article, which does not quote any sources, says that the two-bomb subassemblies needed for each test are carried on separate top-secret flights and are put together at the last moment on the atoll. That sort of information which is referred to in that article should be researched by an active and interested Australian foreign affairs minister, who should be attempting to verify the sources that are quoted by such a respected publication as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Le Monde</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really need to know whether the minister has suggested to the United States that, if they wanted to reflect and support worldwide opinion on this matter, they should consider the action as has been suggested to Senator Evans by Senator Coulter. Unless we see evidence that these sorts of actions have taken place, we would have to conclude that the minister is easily convinced by the glib assurances that he gave us that all is well, that no action can take place and that the conducting of the French tests is inevitable. Unless we see evidence that he has taken strong, aggressive action on this matter, we can only describe his actions as being less than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have been unkind in the language they have used in that regard. I will not do that. But what I will say is that we do not see evidence of strength and persistence. When we see publications such as that contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS> of 16 September this year, in which we can conclude that there has been an unhealthy cooperation between members of the nuclear club who have looked after each other, as evidenced by this apparent United States cooperation here, but we do not have our minister aggressively following them through to determine whether they are accurate or not, then the conclusion speaks for itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, on a personal note, I congratulate you, Madam Deputy President, on the important office that you now hold and the way you are discharging your responsibilities with great dignity and professionalism. Tonight I also wish to draw the Senate's attention to a diverse range of problems associated with what is colloquially referred to as the superannuation 10 per cent rule. Honourable senators would be aware that there is a scale of age based tax deductible contributions which are available for self-employed persons where outside salary income is earned by a self-employed taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 15th report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, the AMA drew the committee's attention to the provisions of subsection 82AAS(2) and (3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. These provisions can have serious implications on the personal superannuation of, say, a visiting medical officer who works in a public hospital. Where the income from the hospital exceeds 10 per cent of their gross income, the tax deduction from superannuation contributions, which are available to them as self-employed persons, is denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA submission stated that this income tax 10 per cent limitation rule can put VMOs at a significant disadvantage compared with other practitioners who gain tax concessions for superannuation contributions and can act as a disincentive for practitioners to enter into or remain in public hospitals. In addition, building design professions have expressed similar reservations to those expressed by the AMA. The building design professions recommended that the government establish an equitable system where everybody is entitled to the same deductibility of contributions up to a certain limit regardless of their source of income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time I have been advised that other professional people working for government boards and agencies are similarly affected. In fact, one was forced to resign as chair of a government board where he brought particular expertise, coupled with a very deep social and community consciousness. In that case the loss of tax deductions incurred a tax liability by an amount exceeding 170 per cent of his remuneration. This denial of the deduction of personal superannuation from a person earning more than 10 per cent of his or her income from salary of employment is of concern to the general community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remind the Senate that after a long fight the superannuation guarantee charge was removed from local government councillors' allowances to be a sensible protection from the tax office for self-employed people who act in a largely honorary capacity. I acknowledge the work of my colleague Senator Macdonald in bringing about this amendment. However, superannuation support is required in circumstances where those councillors are effectively full-time employees. That issue has never been in doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems extraordinary that, despite the committee's report and assurances from the Australian Taxation Office that enforcements were under way, there is nowadays a massive dispute between at least two government departments&mdash;on the one hand, the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Veterans' Affairs and, on the other hand, a state instrumentality in New South Wales, the New South Wales Department of Health. This defence related department and the New South Wales Department of Health look after the hospital needs of their clients. Both departments of state refused to make superannuation contributions&mdash;that is, Veterans' Affairs and the New South Wales Department of Health. Both departments have a similar argument. They argue that these visiting medical officers are independent contractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for them to take that view, but I take exception to the fact that in the private sector, because the definition in the act is particularly wide, independent contractors as such do come under the ambit of the superannuation guarantee charge. In fact, prosecutions have been instigated for non-compliance in the private sector, but here nothing is done. We expect government agencies to know the law laid down by another arm of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that both departments refuse to make superannuation contributions, the ATO is arbitrarily&mdash;this is the nub&mdash;amending assessments and denying deductions in VMOs' personal returns, despite no contributions from the government hospitals. So they are getting it twice. Reliable sources suggest to me that from one tax office alone there are over 1,000 medical practitioners who have no access to any form of superannuation tax support and the Taxation Office is arbitrarily amending their assessments because they believe the health department or the Department of Defence should have made these sorts of deductions, and had they made those deductions, they would not have made the 10 per cent rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is very serious and must be resolved very quickly because the lack of enforcement by one government agency of another in respect of a legal liability is particularly serious. If ordinary citizens are expected to know and obey the law, so should Commonwealth and state departments. That is one issue. The second issue is that the 10 per cent rule is clearly very unsatisfactory and itself in need of review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter is not only a superannuation guarantee charge and income tax problem; it is an issue which is resulting from community-minded citizens being forced, as I said in the case of this legal practitioner, to resign from positions of use to the government and the community where their services and their expertise are often required. People in their mid-50s often scale down their work-related expenses and give part of their time to community involvement, not necessarily working for full remuneration for government agencies, government boards and so on, and the agencies are expected to take out superannuation. But under the 10 per cent rule we are not going to get these community-minded experts who could offer their expertise to the community and to governments&mdash;federal, state and even local&mdash;when this 10 per cent rule can put them at such a tax disadvantage that they are forced to resign, as in the example that I gave, at a time when they are able to  build up superannuation for retirement but may have a declining income which makes them doubly vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), being a doctor of many years standing, would be aware of the problem. I ask that on behalf of your colleagues you look at this problem because it is not only a problem related to the medical profession but it is a problem that goes across a lot of professions where these good people are being forced to give up responsibilities to government agencies because of what is known as the hideous taxation effect of the 10 per cent rule. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in the Senate I asked a question of Senator Gareth Evans as the Leader of the Government in the Senate as to why the government had not tackled the harder issue of sorting out the uncertainty that exists in relation to land tenure pursuant to the Native Title Act. The government has recently published its proposed amendments which relate to the application and processing of native title claims. I do not criticise the government for that, but I do criticise the government for not going far enough. Today in Australia there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding this legislation and the government has failed to address that. This was the subject of an article in last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, dated 18 September 1995, headed `Mabo process in tatters'. The article was written by Michael Dwyer and states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The euphoria surrounding the passage of the Mabo legislation has given way to frustration and uncertainty, with the mechanism set up to implement Mr Keating's grand vision lurching towards total gridlock.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on in the same article Mr Dwyer stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key issue for the mining industry was the reluctance by the Commonwealth to resolve the question of whether pastoral leases extinguished native title.</PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, in that same article he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And State governments continue to lobby the Commonwealth to legislate to clear up the vexing problem of whether pastoral leases extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA>In that regard he referred to the Wik case and the Mirriuwung Gajerrong claim which is pending in Western Australia. It is true, as Senator Evans said today in his answer to me, that there are pending cases in relation to the certainty of land tenure. Those two cases are cases which are touching upon the question of whether pastoral leases extinguish native title. In Western Australia we have the question of whether reservations on pastoral leases equally extinguish native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is shirking the responsibility that the government has to clear this up to say simply, `It is in the courts; let the courts decide.' That point was made in the very lengthy debate that we had on the native title legislation in this very chamber. When these queries were put to the government, the government said, `Let the courts decide.' It is now nearly two years later and the courts have not decided, and it does not look as though they are going to decide for another year. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Panizza" NAMEID="JI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator Panizza</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did he say that during the debate two years ago?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He said that during the debate two years ago. During questions without notice the government also indicated that it was confident that pastoral leases extinguished native title. That is not the case because history has shown that the stand that the coalition took was correct and the uncertainty that the coalition said would come about as a result of this complex legislation was, indeed, correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take no satisfaction from saying that the coalition was right and that we had it right all along. We now have a situation where the High Court has said there is native title, that the Native Title Act, apart from section 12, is valid and we have to get on with the job of making it work. But, of course, this government is not doing that. It is only approaching the edges. It is tinkering with it, if you like, looking at the process, looking at the application, but not dealing with the essential matters such as certainty of land title. Indeed, Rick Farley&mdash;he is a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and also a former lobbyist for the National Farmers Federation&mdash;stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of the same date:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament and the courts so far have failed to define native title precisely. No one yet knows exactly where the native title exists, or even who the claimants might be.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the real issues. That is what people want to know. This government is failing to address that. I note that it is convenient for the government simply to look at the question of application and process and leave the more difficult questions until after the next election. Why won't the government tell the people of Australia, the Aboriginal community, the mining and pastoral industries, exactly what it intends to do about this uncertainty? It simply cannot say, `This is pending, the courts will decide and you will have to wait and see,' because in a year's time I will be making this same address to the Senate. In a year's time, we will still see mining interests, farmers and pastoralists scratching their heads and asking what it all means. In fact, in that article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> by Mr Dwyer, he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Uncertainty over native title has seen mineral exploration activity drop by up to 20 per cent with many mining companies looking off-shore for "greenfield" development.</PARA>
<PARA>With the current balance of payments in the drastic state that it is in, we can hardly afford to have mining companies going offshore. We can hardly afford to lose that investment and development which could make Australia one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Indeed, the government made much of the results last week which said that assets-wise Australia is the richest country in the world. Of course, it is not going to be if we cannot develop our natural assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say that we should do that in an irresponsible fashion. Of course, you should have regard to sustained development and approach it on the basis of what is good for the country at large. Of course, you look to the Aboriginal groups in these areas and accommodate their interests as well. But, above all, you approach it in a balanced, rational manner and, most of all, in a way that will make the system work, so that the Aboriginal community, the mining community and the pastoralists all have their interests accommodated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far, this government has been good on the rhetoric, good on the sorts of principles and what sounds high and mighty, but it has been very thin indeed on the detail and on how this is all going to work. It is nearly two years later and we still find that the government cannot answer the questions that the coalition put to it during that debate&mdash;the longest debate, I believe, in this country's history. What we were trying to do then was to flush out this detail, to say to the government, `How is this going to work?'. But still today, the government cannot answer these questions, nor is it attempting to answer these questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although looking at the amending of the application process and the processing of claims is perhaps a step in the right direction, and I note that His Honour Mr Justice French has made some worthwhile suggestions in this regard, we are still only scratching the surface. We have to get into the detail of this legislation and make it work, because if we do not, we will cause division in the community. If we do not, we will frustrate the Aboriginal community. If we do not, we will see that mining developers will go offshore and we will lose that much valued development. As well as that, we will frustrate our pastoralists and, furthermore, create division in our rural sector. That adds up to disaster for this country. I believe that if it is not addressed by this government, if it does not take up the responsibility of addressing this matter, we will see more division in the community, less development and the rights of Australians across the board ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the government: you might boast that you have made some step towards amending the application process for native title, but you have only scratched the surface and you have got a long way to go yet. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to talk about the Royal Australian Navy's Hydrographic Service. It was my pleasure to be the guest of the Hydrographic Service last Friday, 22 September, in the visit I made to Wollongong. With the approval off the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) I was able to get a comprehensive view of the work of this important facility within the defence sector. It is of vital importance for the navy but it is equally essential for our civil maritime community. None of the shipping in Australia could operate without accurate charts. I do not need to remind the Senate that over 80 per cent of Australia's trade products are taken by ship and these ships require accurate charts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hydrographic Office is a multi-storey building that has been newly established at Wollongong&mdash;it was in Sydney&mdash;and was opened 10 months ago by the Minister for Defence as a new building. Being a senator interested in defence, I went to see this facility.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was welcomed by the officer in charge of the office, Captain Geoff Geraghty. During the next few hours he introduced me to virtually all the staff in the building on many levels, all of whom analyse the data that is put together by the survey staff of the Hydrographic Service, which is then interpreted, with a great amount of checking, to ensure there are verified modern charts for use in Australian waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assets of the service include two survey ships, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moresby</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Flinders</EMPHASIS>, one of which is at least 30 years old and is about to be replaced by an even more efficient survey vessel. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moresby</EMPHASIS> there are three motor boats for survey use and a helicopter. In addition to these two main ships there are four survey motor launches which are catamarans, and six motor boats, including a seventh which is especially set up for Antarctic survey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 120 uniformed members of the Hydrographic Service in the Navy and 100 civilian staff. There is a budget of $50 million which is applied through the office. These survey assets bring up-to-date charts for the use of our defence and civilian communities. There is also a fixed wing aircraft which is a laser airborne depth sounder unit, which has a facility on a truck which is full of computers to take data from the aircraft. It was my pleasure to see how the data that is collected by these survey assets and dispersed around Australia is received, checked and then interpreted into charts for the use of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area that is the responsibility of the Hydrographic Office is no less than one-eighth of the Earth's surface. It includes all Australian waters, Papua New Guinea, Antarctica, halfway into the Indian Ocean and halfway to New Zealand&mdash;a vast area. Of course, as anyone who has seen a recent chart of Australian waters knows, it is an indication that a fair amount of surveying has been done since Captain Cook, Captain Flinders and the other earliest explorers. There have been certain additions in the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am wearing the tie given to me by the hydrographics service in memory of my visit on Friday, and I wear it proudly as an Australian senator. I was referring to the charting of Australian waters. Even a superficial survey would indicate that there are some gaps but, in all the vital places, there are increasingly accurate charts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The earlier charts, which were in fathoms and even achieved by lead lines, are being replaced by metric measured charts and, more than that, by an electronic chart display and information system. As is evident from the words, that system uses the GPS system&mdash;the global positioning system, which can be accurate to within 10 metres of an absolutely truly defined place on the earth&mdash;to build in information not only about the coastline, depth and tides but also about various hazards and navigational aids, such as lighthouses and buoys. I have a recent survey of Arnhem Land which is in the new format. It happens to be of the Gugari Rip&mdash;or what is colloquially called `the hole in the wall'&mdash;which is some of the islands to the north of Arnhem Land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One project that was brought to my attention was the discovery of a reef 14 metres below the surface and a matter of 20 miles off Port Lincoln and right in the middle of the main shipping lane. This reef had never been discovered until 1992 but was picked up by sonar systematic soundings. It is a conical shaped reef&mdash;like a great pimple coming out of the bottom of the seabed&mdash;and would be quite dangerous if a major ship were travelling immediately above it. Also discovered recently was a bank in the Torres Strait just off the main shipping lane that goes around the Gulf of Carpentaria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commodore John Leech is currently the hydrographicer of the RAN and is responsible for the whole of navy's responsibilities. He gave his apologies for not being present when I visited the Hydrographic Office. Captain Geraghty, along with all the other staff, made sure that I was welcome, but their commanding officer was attending one of his international committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me briefly list the seven committees on which he an Australian representative, because it gives an indication of the range of public service activity which is of benefit to the nation. He is a member of the Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping, the Permanent Committee on Tides and Mean Sea Level, the Steering Committee of the National Tidal Facility, the Association of Australian Ports and Marine Authorities, the Maritime Services Advisory Committee (Navigational Safety), the Heads of Commonwealth Marine Science Agencies and the Commonwealth Spatial Data Committee. Time does not allow me to elaborate on that information, but it is clear that Defence is using its assets not only to its own benefit but also to the benefit of the civil community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by thanking those who received me at Wollongong in this marvellous new facility. I thank my second son, university student Matthew Teague, for accompanying me on this journey. He happens to be a keen sailor and, like me, is a user of the charts produced by this facility. I also thank the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) for his blessing of my visit and all of the staff representing the hydrographic service who welcomed me on Friday. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator Faulkner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a)-(c) In October 1990 the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories wrote to the Attorney-General seeking advice whether, if the receivers and managers of Plywood and Plastics Pty Ltd fail to provide a satisfactory clarification of expenditure of Commonwealth funds, the Commonwealth can take legal recovery action. Subsequently, on a number of occasions the Department for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT) sought legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department in relation to the matter including payment of an advance by cheque in favour of Timbertech, termination of an agreement, obligations to make further payments, and civil recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1991 DASETT notified the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) that the issue of possible prosecution of the Directors of Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd be examined urgently with a view to talking any legal action, civil or criminal that may be possible. In March 1991 the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories wrote to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs enclosing a copy of a report from Price Waterhouse and requesting that the matter be given attention by the appropriate authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) I am not prepared to authorise the diversion of the considerable resources that would be required to identify the documents sought by the honourable Senator. In addition, any reports or advices in relation to this matter cannot be provided as they are subject to legal professional privilege and possible claims of public interest immunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(a)-(c)(iii) My Department instructed the Attorney-General's Department to take action. I am advised that the Attorney-General will be providing appropriate details on this matter in his answer to Question 2239.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)(iv) and (v) Advice from the Attorney-General's Department is that it is unlikely that any further amount will be able to be recovered. There is at present therefore, no action continuing to recover these monies. However, should further evidence come to light in this matter the Commonwealth would reconsider its position to take further action and the likelihood of success of such action, given the relevant statute of limitation period applying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) Should further evidence come to light, the Commonwealth will take all necessary and appropriate action in the circumstances to seek recovery of these amounts. However, the Department has been advised by the Attorney-General's Department that any further civil actions to recover monies would be unsuccessful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(a)-(c) The information sought by the Senator is not readily available and would require considerable staff resources to identify, extract and collate from Departmental files. In addition, most of the material sought would be subject to legal professional privilege and possible claims of public interest immunity. In the circumstances, I am not prepared to direct that this work be undertaken.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator Schacht</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) The terms of reference for this review required an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Indian Ocean Centre for Peace Studies (IOCPS) in meeting its stated objectives. The report of the review was finalised in June 1994. It was not widely distributed since it was a specific purpose evaluation with no system-wide implications. Copies of the report were provided to the universities that participated in the review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The recommendations arising from the review were primarily directed at the IOCPS and covered issues such as organisational structure and administration, staffing, accommodation, research, publications, education, community outreach, national and international networks, policy relevance and conferences. The key recommendation directed at the Commonwealth was that Commonwealth funding for the Centre should be extended for a further five years. This recommendation was not supported by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Commonwealth had agreed to maintain funding for the IOCPS from the National Priority (Reserve) Fund (NP(R)F) until the end of 1995 to enable the Centre to consolidate its position as a self-funding organisation, funding beyond this point from the NP(R)F would have constituted recurrent funding. The NP(R)F program guidelines allow grants to be made for the "developmental, pilot or introductory phase of an activity" and do not allow grants for the "on-going recurrent costs of an activity".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Commonwealth agreed to maintain funding of the IOCPS from the NP(R)F until 1995 to enable the Centre to consolidate its position and seek out alternative funding sources, funding beyond this would have constituted recurrent funding and would, therefore, have been in breach of the program guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(a) The 1995 NP(R)F grant to the Centre was $150,000 which was paid on 8 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The grant was paid to the University of Western Australia which administers the grant. The Centre, however, is a cooperative venture between the University of Western Australia and Curtin University of Technology and has operated under a Memorandum of Agreement between the two universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The Centre is not required to report to the Department on the 1995 expenditure until 30 June 1996. The financial statement for 1994, however, shows a total expenditure of $368,345 and total income of $344,862 of which $150,000 was provided by the NP(R)F grant. The major items of expenditure included $146,873 for salaries, $31,872 for a deficit from 1990-1992, $40,000 for a series </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of projects in developmental studies and $31,952 for a New Delhi Seminar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) The Memorandum of Agreement which the University of Western Australia and Curtin University of Technology have negotiated to operate the IOCPS, allows for funds to be accessed only by the Executive Director with the counter signature of the Research Director or Associate Director. If the two parties agree, funds may be transferred to Curtin University of Technology. As the 1995 financial statement for the IOCPS will not be submitted until June 1996, the Commonwealth has not been advised of the transfer of any funds to Curtin University in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) NP(R)F funding for the Centre ceases at the end of 1995.</PARA>
