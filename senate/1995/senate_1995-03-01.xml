<PARA>On 22 June 1994 the Committee of Privileges was ordered by the Senate to consider a particular instance of refusal by a minister to produce documents in response to an order of the Senate as part of its consideration of the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment (Enforcement of Lawful Orders) Bill 1994, which had been referred to the committee on 12 May 1994. The resolution also required the committee to consider a report by the Auditor-General, subsequently tabled on 20 October, which the Senate had by the same resolution ordered him to produce in relation to leases for office space in the Casselden Place building in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In examining the matter the committee was influenced by a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations tabled on 3 December 1986 and draws attention to that committee's general conclusions on the question of commercial-in-confidence reasons for non-disclosure of contracts to parliamentary committees. The conclusions are outlined at paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Privileges Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee of Privileges has made some observations on these conclusions at paragraph 10 of its report and has reached its own conclusions. Firstly, that the Casselden Place matter referred to the Committee of Privileges on 22 June 1994 constituted a further instance of non-compliance with an order of the Senate which gave rise to the committee's reference on the Parliamentary Privileges (Enforcement of Lawful Orders) Bill 1994. Secondly, the committee reaffirms the comments made in its 49th report that any claims of executive privilege or public interest immunity are ultimately for a house of parliament to determine but draws attention to its comments in paragraph 10 of its report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the committee again draws attention to the suggestion outlined at paragraph 2.15 of its 49th report that, in the event of a conflict between a claim of executive privilege and the assertion by a house of parliament of its right to have access to information, relevant documents be sent to an independent arbitrator to evaluate them on public interest immunity criteria. Fourthly, that, in this instance, the use of an independent arbitrator to examine the matters of concern to the Senate&mdash;that is, the Acting Auditor-General&mdash;appears to have worked satisfactorily. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994, which is now before the chamber, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Most of the amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals. I will briefly outline the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule one contains amendments announced by the Treasurer in the 1994-95 federal budget and have operated since 11 May 1994. The amendments give effect to the government's decision to decrease the customs duty on topped crude oil by 2.977c per litre and on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene by 1.977c per litre. These changes will lower input costs for industry and will specifically benefit coastal shipping, export oriented mineral projects and certain manufacturing operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule two is operative from 1 July 1994. In May 1993, this government decided to reduce the coverage of the Australian system of tariff preferences from 1 July 1993 by phasing out the most developed countries from access to the developing country margin of preference for certain imported commodities. On 4 May this year, my colleague Senator Cook, announced in the Working Nation White Paper that a similar phase-out would be extended to the remainder of goods in the customs tariff with the exception of cheese, sugar, unmanufactured tobacco and certain replacement components for passenger motor vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The phase-out of the margin of preference will be achieved by freezing the developing country rate for the subject goods at their pre-first of July 1994 level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasurer also announced on budget night 1994 an increase of 1.194c per litre in customs duties on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene for use in aircraft. This increase is a further part of the process announced by the government in the 1992-93 federal budget of a phased introduction of full recovery of the costs incurred by the Civil Aviation Authority in implementing aviation safety standards, and 50 per cent of their costs of safety standards setting and compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rate of duty on aviation gasoline is subject to further variation in respect to the duty collected and paid to the CAA to recover airways costs attributable to aviation gasoline powered aircraft. The reduction of 7.521c per litre follows the adoption by the CAA of a marginal cost basis for the pricing of services provided to operators of gasoline powered aircraft. This approach has been adopted in recognition of the fact that a large proportion of CAA facilities are put in place because they are required for regular public transport operations mostly undertaken by aviation kerosene powered aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the government's policy pertaining to the automotive industry until the year 2000, tariffs on passenger motor vehicle replacement components were to be maintained at fifteen per cent from 1 July 1992. Amendments contained in this schedule redress certain anomalies which arose in the implementation of the government's policy. Specifically, a number of tariff classifications were omitted from the original PMV schedule of replacement components. There were also a small number of other classifications for which rates of duty had already fallen below the 15 per cent threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments introduce a consistent application of government assistance for imported replacement components for the australian automotive sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Malaysia Australia trade agreement provides bi-lateral trade concessions. The amendments contained in this schedule provide a free rate of duty for unvulcanised compounded rubber from Malaysia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule three will operate from 23 September 1994. Following a decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 19 January 1994, the government's intended assistance rate of 12 per cent (now 10 per cent) for semi-finished lens blanks for spectacles was reduced to free.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has put in place a regimented decrease in tariff protection since July 1988. The purpose of this amendment is to restore the previous level of assistance for semi-finished lens blanks and a structured phase down for the subject goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also contains a number of other minor technical or administrative amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Summaries of the amendments contained in this bill have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The references to provision numbers in the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) in this speech are, unless otherwise indicated, references to provision numbers as they were before the renumbering of the Migration Act 1958 on 1 September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the second time that this legislation has been introduced into the Senate. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No 3) 1994 first passed in the other place on 11 October 1994. Regrettably the Opposition did not support the bill on that occasion and voted with others in the Senate to defeat the bill on 9 November last.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I stated at the time that the Government considered the bill of such importance that it would be reintroduced as soon as possible. The Government did not accept the refusal of the Opposition to support this vital legislation and would give the Opposition another chance to support it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomes the Opposition's belated acceptance of the importance of this bill and their indication that they will now support it. The bill itself is unchanged from that which the Opposition rejected last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, through its proposed changes to section 35 and 36 of the act (which were renumbered in December 1989 to become sections 87 and 88 respectively) seeks to restore to those sections the effect they were thought to possess prior to the decision of the High Court in Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was this decision which gave rise to the commencement of claims against the Commonwealth for compensation for wrongful imprisonment of a number of unauthorised boat arrivals who are usually referred to as boat people. Prior to this decision no one had questioned the use of section 36 of the act (from December 1989 to September 1994 numbered as section 88) to detain the unauthorised arrivals in question. Indeed, those sections were not challenged in the Lim proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 36 of the act deals with people who come to Australia by boat without prior authorisation and who may be kept in custody until the departure of the vessel from its last port of call in Australia. Up until May 1991, unauthorised boat arrivals of this kind were detained in custody under this section while their claims to remain in Australia were assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Lim case other aspects of migration legislation involving boat people were challenged and doubt was subsequently cast upon the lawfulness of detention for a number of boat people under section 88 once it became apparent that the boats on which they had arrived would never depart Australia. This doubt turns not on the central issue of unauthorised arrival, but on the understanding that the vessel be expected to leave Australia on a further, outward and ongoing voyage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this instance, the Commonwealth acted on a mistaken view of what the law was, believing&mdash;like all other concerned parties&mdash;that its detention of boat people was lawful. It is significant that no-one, apparently including the boat people themselves&mdash;and their legal representatives&mdash;saw any reason to question the lawfulness of detention on the basis none of the vessels on which they had arrived had ever left Australia. Should that custody prove to have been unlawful, it is as a result of an innocent and technical breach, and no more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has created an artificial situation when the fact of the matter is that the boat people did arrive in Australia unlawfully, and their detention was based on the understanding of the provisions of section 36 (section 88) by the Government and the Department at that time. Nevertheless, actions for damages have been lodged by some 88 of the boat people who now maintain that their detention under section 36 (section 88) was unlawful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New provisions to detain unauthorised boat arrivals came into effect in May 1992 with the commencement of Division 4B of the act. These provisions, under which the boat people have been detained since May 1992, were found by the High Court in the Lim case to be constitutionally valid. However, at that time the High Court cast doubt upon the use of section 88 to detain boat people. As a consequence, section 54RA was enacted in late December 1992 with the support of the Opposition. This section extinguished the right of action for damages for false imprisonment for persons found to have been unlawfully detained under section 88 prior to their transfer to custody under Division 4B of the act, replacing it with a statutory right of action limiting to one dollar per day the damages payable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the former Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Honourable Gerry Hand, declared to Parliament, ". . . It is essential to counter the possibility of significant damages claims. It would be absurd for the Australian taxpayer to be expected to underwrite compensation payments to people who arrived here without authority and who have been detained on reasonable grounds while their claims to remain were exhaustively examined".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A case challenging the constitutional validity of the compensation scheme established in section 54RA&mdash;and I would repeat that the compensation scheme in section 54RA was regarded as constitutionally valid when it was established&mdash;is yet to be heard by the High Court. The main ground for challenge is likely to be that section 54RA breaches section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, in that it involves an acquisition of property by the Commonwealth otherwise than on just terms. A number of High Court decisions since section 54RA was enacted on the ambit of the "just terms" requirement in the Constitution have raised doubts whether the limit on damages to one dollar per day is constitutional.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I earlier remarked, the amendments proposed seek to reflect the Commonwealth's previous understanding of sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88), and their operation. Legislative amendments of this kind can be classed as "curative", which retrospectively correct defects discovered in the law or its administration, and restores what was previously thought by all parties to be the status quo.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent High Court judgements involving the "just terms" requirement of our Constitution have suggested that this approach of "curative" legislation is an avenue available to the Commonwealth. Indeed the courts, including the present Chief Justice of the High Court, have emphasised that it is always open for Parliament to correct developments in the law, other than in constitutional matters, where those developments do not accord with Parliament's intention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rationale for curative legislation is the strong public interest in the proper functioning of government. Occasional defects in administration or statutory drafting are inevitable, and it may be fairly argued that a law which seeks retrospectively to cure innocent defects does not take away rights. It merely gives effect to administrative action already taken. Action, it should be noted, which was previously assumed by all relevant parties to be valid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill&mdash;the No.3 bill&mdash;is substantially identical to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994 introduced in the Senate on 8 June 1994. The Government has introduced this bill with the intention of placing the Commonwealth in the strongest possible position to defend the claims for compensation. The bill seeks only to achieve the same effect as what was intended by the enactment of section 54RA&mdash;to prevent a possible windfall of a substantial award of damages to persons who arrived in Australia without lawful authority and were held in detention for the legitimate reason of assessing their claims to stay in this country as refugees. In this way, the Government seeks to ensure that section 88 has, and always had, the effect and operation that Parliament intended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition parties were influenced in their earlier decision to oppose the curative measures in this bill by the dissenting report of their members of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in it's consideration of the No.2 bill. That report attempts to distinguish the proposed curative steps in the bill from the dollar a day provision on the ground of retrospectivity. This is pure sophistry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 54RA limits  any compensation payable to one dollar per day after the cause of action concerned has already arisen. Thus the Parliament has already applied retrospective measures to substantially limit the claims of the boat people for compensation. Sufficient doubt has now been placed upon the measures taken to date, for the Government to accept the necessity of pursuing further retrospective measures of a curative nature to ensure that the Commonwealth is in the strongest possible position to defend these claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dissenting report also adopted the line pursued in the submission of the Law Council of Australia before the Committee, that the curative measures would distort the relationship between the legislative and judicial arms of government. This submission ignores the well established prerogative of the Parliament to legislate so as to affect and alter existing rights at issue in pending litigation without interfering with the exercise of judicial power in a way that is inconsistent with the Constitution. Until the High Court decides otherwise, curative legislation of this nature remains a valid course open to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the curative provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to sections 35 and 36 (sections 87 and 88) do not seek to change the operation of those sections, but insert new provisions intended instead to reflect the Commonwealth's understanding of sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88) and the manner in which they were actually administered in practice prior to the commencement of Division 4B. The Attorney-General's Department has been consulted at every stage of the drafting process. It is the view of that Department that the amendments are not inconsistent with Australia's obligations under international law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed subsection 36(1AA) (subsection 88(1A)) seeks to put beyond doubt that section 36 (section 88) authorises the custody, for a finite period, of persons who arrive without lawful authority on board a vessel that subsequently is unable to depart Australia because it has been destroyed, or for example is not seaworthy, has been impounded or forfeited, has sunk, or is otherwise unable to depart.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment also permits the taking and keeping of persons in custody, notwithstanding that the vessel on which those persons departed for Australia might not necessarily be the same vessel on which those persons arrive. It is restricted to persons who arrive on vessels that have left an Australian port and returned to an Australian port without having entered any other country. This covers situations where a person arrives at a port in Australia on an Australian based vessel, to which the person was transferred from the vessel on which that person left another country, for instance to a rescue vessel when the original vessel is about to sink.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the circumstances envisaged by new subsection 36(1AA) (subsection 88(1A)) it is not appropriate that the period for which a person may be detained should be determined by reference to the departure of a vessel from a port. The proposed amendments will, therefore, provide that custody is to be authorised until the person is granted an entry permit; or for such period as is necessary to allow for the person's removal from Australia, following a request in writing from the person to be removed, or after all applications to remain (for example, entry permit applications and applications for refugee status) and associated appeals or reviews have been finalised, or once all consideration of whether the person will be permitted to remain in Australia has been otherwise concluded; or until such earlier time as an authorised officer directs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the act, a person is considered to have entered Australia once they disembark in Australia. Proposed subsection 36(1AB) (subsection 88(1B)) makes it clear that a person is taken not to have entered Australia as a result of temporarily, haphazardly disembarking&mdash;for instance, on an island off the Australian mainland, briefly and without the knowledge of the Australian authorities&mdash;after which the persons then reboard their vessel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment to section 35 (section 87) similarly does not seek to alter its existing operation but instead inserts specific provisions, to avoid any doubts, as to the extent of the power under this section. Under it an officer may, to prevent a person from entering Australia unlawfully, require a vessel to enter a port and require unauthorised persons to remain on that vessel until it arrives at the port.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I repeat that these simple, common-sense amendments, curative in nature, seek no more than to ensure that sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88) of the act have and have had the operation and effect that Parliament intends them to have, which is the operation and effect which the Department and Ministers previously understood those provisions to have had.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also inserts a constitutional validity or "reading down" provision. This will provide, unless a contrary intention can be clearly discerned, that where a provision of the act could have both valid and invalid applications, the provision is to have every valid application and is not to have any invalid application. The provision is similar to and consistent with "reading down" provisions in certain other Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the doubt over the validity of section 54RA the Government proposes to repeal that section in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By supporting the curative steps proposed by this bill the Parliament can provide the Commonwealth with the strongest possible position for the defence of the boat peoples' claims. In doing so the Parliament will not as I have outlined above be embracing retrospectivity for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament has already demonstrated its will to protect the Commonwealth, and the taxpayer, from the potential burden of compensation payments to those unauthorised boat arrivals who were detained under section 88 while their claims to remain in Australia were exhaustively assessed. The Government's commitment to this position is demonstrated by the introduction of the curative measures in this bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;We have canvassed the issue, obviously. We have not got the support of the Democrats, despite their previous public stance that they would prefer a prolonged investigation of this bill. The sad reality is that when it comes to the vote we will not have the numbers. This legislation, as I said yesterday, fundamentally alters the whole structure of health care in this country. It is absolutely appalling that the legislation is not to be given the scrutiny that it deserves. I know for certain that the people who are going to be most affected by this will be the patients out there in the community. None of us want to be consumers of health care but it is inevitable that every year one in seven people approach a doctor and receive some form of treatment. So one in seven people in the community listening today will need to access health care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will fundamentally alter the contract whereby the patient becomes contracted to an insurance company, whereas at present the patient is contracted to the doctor who is looking after them. I know which position I would like to be in. I would not want to put my faith in an insurance company, but that is in essence what will occur under this legislation. The Democrats have always preached this mantra that they are going to `keep the bastards honest'. I do not want to put that mantra upon the Western Australian Greens; I do not impugn their honesty at all, but surely they would agree that there needs to be thorough scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reply I was given from the Western Australian Greens, and from the Democrats for that matter, was that it was some sort of trick, that it was because in this case the opposition might have a casting vote. The same thing was said about the whistleblowers committee&mdash;that it was some sort of trick. It has been fairly obvious that in the conduct of that committee that has not occurred. By bringing it to the vote we will have these people on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already had 67 separate submissions in relation to this legislation and, despite what Senator Chamarette said, the agenda for the hearings on Friday is that they start at 10.30 in the morning, conclude at 4.20 p.m. and then resume on Monday morning for an hour and a half. So it is not two days. It happens to be two separate days on which they are sitting but the actual time given to the debate is one day. So it is a one-day hearing, albeit that it is being postponed on Friday after previous legislation is considered early in the morning&mdash;again something of serious significance, the compensation bill, the so-called double dipping when people are under workers compensation. So it is a one-day bill. It is a one-day quick and dirty operation. I believe the people of Australia deserve better than a one-day quick and dirty look at the legislation, but that is what is going to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have said that if the evidence shows that then it may need to be extended. There are 67 separate submissions on this matter from interested bodies. The only ones that are supporting it are part&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;of the Australian Health Insurance Association. The Medical Benefits Fund, which is the largest privately operated company in Australia representing 1.4 million people, is totally against the legislation. The Aged Care Organisation of Australia is totally against the legislation. The psychiatric service is totally against the legislation and the rehabilitation service is totally against the legislation. The only supporter, as far as I can see, is the Executive Director of the Australian Health Insurance Association and even his organisation is split. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I would like to know is why the rush to judgment. Where is the consultation? Where is the opportunity for consumers to appear before us? This is a one day, quick and dirty operation supported by the Democrats and the Western Australian Greens. I think the Australian public deserves better than that. When this legislation comes before the parliament we will do everything in our power to expose the hypocrisy of the so-called independent groups. I think it is clear that there needs to be much more debate, much more reference to the community and much more opportunity for the organisations to appear before a Senate select committee.

<PARA>I look at the first of those amendments, which relates to clause 3 on page 25. It relates to the amount to be provided to the fund. The amount provided originally was $121 million. That was on a per year basis. In other words, it was a fixed sum. Our original amendment had proposed that there be an additional $3 million a year&mdash;again, a fixed sum. That would have effectively capped the amount for administration and, over time, would have meant that the amount available in real terms would have diminished over the period of 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment seeks to ensure that at least $3 million is available. It allows the parliament, by means of an appropriation from the consolidated revenue fund, to increase that amount each year, presumably on an indexation basis but providing a general discretion. Having the additional funds appropriated from other legislation avoids the difficulties that are normally involved with the Senate seeking to provide for an increase in funds and avoids the necessity for a request to be pressed with the House of Representatives on the matter. It can simply be put forward in terms of an amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the course of the select committee's hearings on the amendments as dealt with by the chamber the last time this was before us, there were a number of views expressed in relation to the amendments. What we have before us today are amendments proposed by the coalition which deal with concerns that were raised during the hearing. I absolutely refute any allegation that the members of this committee went into those hearings with their minds made up. That was not the case and that is evidenced by the fact that in some cases we have changed our stance in relation to the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, there is the appropriation of $3 million for administration expenses, which has previously been mentioned. That has been changed to an appropriation from a request. What is more, there is an amount of $3 million or such higher amount as is appropriated by the parliament from the consolidated revenue fund for this purpose. That simply says that there is no cap, as such. There was some concern expressed during the hearings about a cap being placed on administrative expenses. That, in brief, is the reason for that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I would call the second amendment, which on the circular appears as 3(f), relates to the Indigenous Land Corporation making sure as best as possible that there is no native title involved in any land that it seeks to acquire. Again, there was some concern about that because in our prior wording we had required that the Indigenous Land Corporation lodge a non-claimant application pursuant to the Native Title Act. Of course, there has been some legal concern that you cannot lodge a non-claimant application if you have no interest in the land. That is, you have to have some aspect of a lease&mdash;freehold, licence. What you would have in this instance is a requirement that the Indigenous Land Corporation go along in a situation where it has no interest in a piece of land and make an application or non-claimant procedure to clear the decks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was thought that there might be a legal hindrance to the Indigenous Land Corporation doing this. There was also come concern expressed by witnesses that this would unduly delay any acquisition of land. So that is why you will see in what I call amendment No. 2, which is subparagraph (3)(f), the deletion of the requirement for lodging a non-claimant application. I believe that streamlines the situation and answers the concerns that were expressed to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next amendment appearing on page 4 is subparagraph (3)(g) which deals with amendment No. 4 previously dealt with by this chamber. That is the one which dealt with the rather controversial phrase `those most severely dispossessed'. What has happened there is that the whole paragraph has been deleted. It formerly read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)if a conflict arises as to the allocation of resources, preference is to be given to those Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders who are most severely dispossessed of their traditional lands;</PARA>
<PARA>That is now deleted and replace by new wording in what I call amendment No. 3, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)if a conflict arises as to the allocation of the resources of the Fund, priority is to be given to those who suffer most disadvantage in relation to access to land or who are unable to gain substantive title to land.'.</PARA>
<PARA>That I believe clarifies the phrase `most severely dispossessed'. There was evidence given that the principle was a good one but the wording was not that good and it could be improved upon. We are indebted to the Aboriginal rights movement from South Australia for that wording. That wording was suggested during the hearing in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we have in subparagraph (h) the amendment which deals with consultation with traditional owners. Previously it was in amendment No. 26, that before the Indigenous Land Corporation performs a land acquisition function it should take all reasonable steps to consult with traditional owners of the land. During the course of the evidence given to this committee there was some concern as to what constitutes a traditional owner and it did cause some consternation. The coalition senators, and I believe the Greens as well, took this on board and a suggestion was made that instead of saying `traditional owners' it should be expressed in terms of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having a traditional or historic link with the land. That spelt it out a bit more clearly because that aspect needed clarification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There we have a thumbnail sketch, if you like, of the amendments proposed by the coalition and the reasons that they came about. I would seek to address them in a touch more detail because I do think it is important for it to be placed on the record as to the evidence given during the course of this committee and why that evidence was accepted in these discrete instances. It is interesting to note that in the government's land fund bill mark II, which is in the other place, it has adopted some amendments which were canvassed by the select committee on the land fund bill. Those dealt with the disclosure of information in criminal proceedings, the native title committee having a function of review, any change in the national strategy being notified to the minister within two months and one or two other amendments that escape my memory. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, we have provided more discretion to the parliament to go beyond the $3 million, and we have done it by a mechanism which allows for an amendment. Secondly, there is effectively a direction as to how the $3 million is to be spent, allowing for indexation. Thirdly, there is a legal clarification to make it clear that day-to-day administrative expenses ought to be spent on just that and to ensure that land fund moneys are spent on land acquisition and maintenance; in other words, to both minimise administrative expenses and quarantine the nature of those expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is a direction to the Indigenous Land Corporation and the general manager to act accordingly&mdash;to minimise and to ensure that any administrative surplus goes on maintenance as far as practicable. In other words, we have sought to ensure not only that land fund moneys are not eaten into by excessive administration expenses but also that a positive incentive is provided to keep those expenses as low as possible so that additional funds will be left over for land acquisition and maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That seems to us to strike a very sensible balance. It will probably put pressure on the managers from the stakeholders and ensure that, as we always hope, administrative expenses are as low as possible and the substance of the legislation is what is given most attention. That deals with what I want to cover in relation to that first bracket. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes this amendment for reasons of principle, for technical reasons and for practical reasons. Let me spell all of those out. As to questions of principle, the removal of the $3 million cap in the original amendment&mdash;which we have, of course, sought&mdash;is here offset by a provision requiring the government to provide a separate appropriation for the ILC's administration expenses every year. That will require governments to find additional moneys separate from the land fund for administrative purposes. That is a new burden being created for the government which the government is not minded to accept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Be that as it may, the larger issue of principle that underlies this is the reality that we now have a fairly extreme form of paternalism being imposed upon this corporation. Virtually all other statutory bodies&mdash;certainly every one that I have been able to think of or research so far, and certainly those with commercial functions&mdash;are given discretions as to how much of their funding will be spent on administrative costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very paternalistic, I have to say, not to trust the Indigenous Land Corporation, virtually alone among statutory corporations, to be able to manage its finances appropriately. It might not have been the motivation of this amendment&mdash;which is to provide some additional amount for administration, and no doubt I will be told that by the opposition&mdash;but it is certainly its effect. For that reason, quite apart from any of the others, there is a problem right at the threshold with this kind of amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The technical problem I might try to describe in the following terms. It is a legal problem which could, in fact, prevent the land fund from being credited with any money at all during its first 10 years, with the way the legislation is crafted. The formula for credit to the land fund in each category A year includes, with this amendment, an unspecified amount of not less than $3 million to be appropriated by the parliament. That actually conflicts in its terms with existing subsection 193(5), which provides a standing appropriation for the purposes of credit to the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one interpretation this amendment combined with 193(5) itself now purports to appropriate at least $3 million. But of course the committee is not in a position to appropriate anything or at least to initiate a clause appropriating anything. That would have to come from the House. So the amendment is improperly cast and it should be a request. I am not sure that that is a very powerful argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A rather more obvious and, I think, more powerful interpretation is that what is going on here technically is the negation of the standing appropriation in 193(5) by this further provision providing for the additional appropriation to be made year by year, with the result that no credit may be made to the land fund unless and until the parliament appropriates the additional unspecified amount each year. What that means of course is, in turn, that credits to the land fund would not be determined by this bill, by this legislative exercise that we are presently engaged in. The credits to the land fund itself, leaving aside the question of administration, would have to depend upon yearly appropriations being made by the parliament&mdash;and, of course, the parliament may or may not make those appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can be absolutely sure that so long as the Labor Party remains in government we certainly would; we are absolutely totally committed to this. But I have to say, in all charity and generosity, there would have to be doubts about a similar commitment from the other side of politics to this. On our reading of what you have technically done by introducing this amendment, you have made that credit to the land fund itself, the acquisition fund, wholly dependent on the vagaries of parliamentary process and the parliamentary majority, rather than doing it now for 10 years, which is the very least that people want us to do in order to ensure the permanence or at least the first 10 years of the creation of this fund, and to achieve that here and now by the enactment of a standing appropriation that has been put at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a third category of problems&mdash;what I describe as practical problems. We still have, of course, what is in effect a statutory cap on expenditure on day-to-day administration. The cap is not confined to $3 million; it is $3 million or such higher amount as is appropriated, but it is still, in effect, a cap on the basis of the particular amount that is appropriated each year. What that cap may prove to do in practice is prevent the ILC from operating at all for part or conceivably even for most of any given year, once that particular amount is exhausted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy enough to envisage situations in which, with the best managed corporation in the world, that could occur. There are often variations in expenditure beyond the control of a corporation, that can arise&mdash;for example, the necessity to answer any litigation brought against it. When you take into account the number of potential sources of litigation that are now available under the bill as it presently stands coming out of the Senate and as is proposed to be further amended today, this is a very real prospect. We all know the merciless impact litigation costs can have on even the best run outfits if they have to bear these costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So you could have a situation with the ILC and the subsidiaries having to close down for a large part of a year, with many outstanding debts owed to staff and to others. The performance by the ILC of any of its functions will always involve administrative expenditure in the form of salaries and payments of office, transport and other costs&mdash;surveying, conveyancing and so on. But I say again, it may prove quite impossible to confine this kind of expenditure to some fixed amount or fixed proportion of total expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capacity of the ILC to operate under these circumstances when confronted with pressures of the kind that I have described will depend in turn upon the willingness of the parliament to grant further appropriate funds to carry the administrative expenditure on in that particular year. Under those circumstances, once again, you have a situation where the operations of the ILC are not only dependent on the whims and fancies of the parliament in passing the additional appropriation for the actual administrative expenditures but, in circumstances which could very easily conceivably arise where that particular quantum is exceeded in a particular year, you will depend further on the willingness of the parliament to make the appropriate further supplementary appropriation to get the organisation through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are all sorts of obvious practical impacts that flow from that. Far from guaranteeing the ILC funding security, we see this amendment as removing its funding security because there is ample capacity for the ILC to make its own decisions and its own judgments about the proportion of administrative expenses from the existing amount that is appropriated under the bill as it was introduced by us. We are sure there will be ample pressures upon the ILC not to expand unnecessarily its administrative expenses. As always, under pressures of that kind, this body will be under the spotlight, and properly so. I do not think that there is a need for any extra statutory discipline of the kind that is here proposed or is here necessarily involved. Quite apart from the paternalism of it all, and repeating the point with which I began, there are some very obvious practical problems about leaving this up in the air and subject to changing circumstances in the way that this does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the net result of all of this is that the government believes that the substituted amendments are even more objectionable than the original version of the amendment on the ground that they do contain what seems to us to be a manifest legal error. They do leave the land fund operations vulnerable to funding crises, and they do impose an arbitrary interference on the autonomy and the flexibility of the Indigenous Land Corporation. For all those reasons, you will not be surprised to hear me repeat that the government will be opposing this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a question for the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) about the principle that he raised. This amendment that is being referred to as a so-called cap was never intended as a cap&mdash;and well the minister knows it&mdash;but was intended as a quarantining of the administrative costs from the acquisition and management functions of the money that is being set aside for the land fund. The conversion of it from a request to an amendment was simply so that that quarantining effect could be put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two questions&mdash;maybe there are three&mdash;that I have for the minister. Firstly, if, as you say, there is a requirement now for parliament to determine the appropriations on an annual basis, could you inform me whether you think the impact of this amendment is that the appropriation will be in excess of $3 million or whether it will be an unspecified amount that has to be appropriated? I think that is a fairly legitimate criticism of the framing of the amendment. My understanding is that it is only that amount which is in excess of $3 million which is to be determined annually by parliament; not an X figure at all, but an additional amount to the $3 million, which really was determined at the setting of the amount that the government had said it had given for administrative costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you remember, the way in which the government determined the total withdrawal from its so-called billion dollar fund which would go to Aboriginal people was based on a doubling of the ATSIC allocation of $21 million which is already there, plus $3 million for administrative costs. That total of $45 million is what we have been working with as the complete expropriation that is available to our Aboriginal people every year forever from this so-called billion dollar fund. The $3 million cap was really that set by the government. The only thing that the government did not do was to endeavour to make sure that that $3 million would not encroach on the amount available for acquisition and management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the first question is: is it not the fact that it is the additional part to that $3 million that may be needed to be determined by parliament, and is that not, in a sense, a legitimate way of parliament checking that the administrative costs are not totally depleting the land fund?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question is: when will the ILC cease to function in terms of administrative costs? If there is no limitation on how much of the fund is to be used for management and there is no limitation on the amount that is to be used for administration, what is the government intending to do with the bill when the total $45 million expropriated from the fund is being used for existing management and existing administration? Will the fund then close and simply be a draw down for management, or what exactly will happen when there is no available money to either give Aboriginal people the capacity to acquire land or manage land that has been acquired or is in their possession?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third question is: although there are some technical problems with the amendment, if the government has the goodwill to support the spirit of the amendment could it not suggest a better way in which the spirit of the amendment could be incorporated into the fund so that Aboriginal people would gain at least $3 million, or possibly more, for the acquisition and management functions so that the fund would not be limited in terms of its administrative costs beyond a reasonable means?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that I fully untangled three separate questions there, but if I have not answered them please let me know whether I need to respond further when I sit down. As to the basic technical question of what is involved here, let me put it again this way: existing provision 193(5) of the bill simply says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Consolidated Revenue Fund is appropriated for the purposes of this section.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an easy provision to understand and apply as the proposed section is now crafted as it was introduced by the government, because the only appropriation that is being referred to is the one for the whole 10-year period of $121 million a year effectively. That is subject to these various indexation factors, as is spelt out. That is all accomplished in one hit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty arises from the fact that the amendment now before us proposes to add to that basic formula a new formula which is of uncertain impact in terms of the actual dollar sum involved. There is no precise formula involved that sets in concrete the calculation of the additional amount for the whole period of operation here. It is $3 million, or such higher amount more than $3 million, as is appropriated each year. The amendment in terms does not actually appropriate even the basic $3 million. It leaves it up to parliament each year to appropriate the $3 million, or the $3 million plus as the case may be. It is quite proper that a plus has been built in because obviously over time administrative expenses may require more than $3 million&mdash;not with our present inflation policy, but one has to anticipate that possibility in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those circumstances, we then have a situation where simultaneously we have what purports to be a standing appropriation pursuant to a specific concrete formula and added to that a contingent sort of provision which depends upon what parliament chooses to appropriate each year. We cannot have those two things living together without some further attention to the technicalities involved, which has not been done in the drafting here. What we are saying is that the most likely interpretation of all this by a court is that the standing appropriation here would not bite in any given year unless and until the further appropriation task is undertaken by the parliament&mdash;the task of appropriating an amount of $3 million, or $3 million plus, for this purpose. So the whole thing is to that extent thrown into technical uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if we were to fix that particular technical problem, which may or may not be easily fixable, we still have the problems of principle that I have described about the paternalism of it all. If people are not moved by that, they still have the practical problems that in any given year it may just be that a swathe of demands are being made upon the corporation, particularly in the form of litigation&mdash;that is the easiest additional impost one can imagine arising&mdash;</PARA>

What we are saying is that the original bill might not have enough money to satisfy your tastes, Senator Chamarette, and I understand that argument, but within those constraints at least you have a non-paternalistic recognition of the right and the legitimacy of the corporation making its own decisions subject to all the checks and balances of a practical kind that will be upon it, and you do not have the whole series of problems that I have identified that are associated with this amendment. </PARA>

When will the ILC cease to function if there is no cap on administration, there is no more money in the fund beyond that which is already expended on management requirements and administration costs and there is no further money available of the total $45 million each year that is the draw down figure to actually acquire any land or manage any further land? Does the fund cease to exist?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very best case scenario, the calculations of the Greens on how soon that will be are well under the 10 years, if the administration costs are not capped in some way. So what is the government intending to do with this legislation, when we have a so-called billion dollar fund sitting in the consolidated revenue and the draw down is totally utilised by previous commitments for management and administration costs but actually has no additional money to provide for acquisition or management? That is the second question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the government not capable of overcoming some of these technical problems? I did understand the answer that Senator Evans gave and I do see it as a possible chicken and egg problem. If it is true that this amendment means that the money cannot be drawn down till they are already expending it, because we do not know how much it is, then that is a problem. But surely the government has the skill of reading the spirit of the amendment, which is to quarantine the administration costs from eating away the acquisition and management sections of the fund. If the government is so concerned about the lack of sympathy on the opposition side, why is it not willing to let the opposition support this motion as a sign of its goodwill that if it were to be in a position to be requested for such an appropriation it would be on the public record as having committed itself to doing so?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final question explains the second question that Senator Evans failed to answer. Has the government in its own mind got no limit at all that it is going to allow for the administration costs or the legal costs that come out of this fund and, by virtue of the way it is designed, deny the dispossessed Aboriginal people, who are supposed to be the beneficiaries of the fund, from gaining any acquisition or management funding?</PARA>

That confidence is reinforced by all the scrutiny processes and accountability processes that are built into the legislation and which we have debated on other occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To treat this particular corporation differently from the way in which we treat all other commercial corporations established by statute of which I am aware is to introduce a wholly new element of paternalism in our approach to the boards in question which I would have thought Senator Chamarette would agree was inappropriate. It does involve a degree of faith and confidence in the quality of the boards that we produce and their particular responsibility to the people whom this legislation is designed to help. That is essentially the answer&mdash;a combination of not wanting to be paternalistic combined with confidence in the structures and processes and confidence in the people who are likely to be appointed. There is plenty of statutory guidance on what sort of people they must be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of when the fund would cease to operate if there was no cap, for a start, there is a draw down permitted of about $45 million a year, as Senator Chamarette says. I do not think in any conceivable scenario a significant proportion of that larger sum of $45 million would be occupied in administrative expenses. Even in a catastrophic litigation or expense environment, it is difficult to see any sort of massive invasion of that. But it is very easy to see the way in which any given amount of $3 million or $3 million plus could be exceeded in any particular year. It is for that reason that we want to give the corporation the flexibility to manage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a top-up provision in the bill as it stands to cope with a situation where the investment return on the fund might have been less in practice than that which we anticipate. There is no similar top-up, I suppose, to cover administrative costs which turn out to be in excess of what we are guessing to be, on average, about $3 million a year. I guess in that exceptional circumstance, where some massive impost does arise&mdash;some major series of litigation burdens&mdash;it would always be open to the parliament in that situation to respond generously and appropriately and say, `Under these circumstances there is too much of a burden being borne by the basic fund itself, against our intentions and our expectations, and we'll make a special supplementary appropriation to deal with that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can envisage that possibility. But that is very different from every year this process being dependent on that degree of parliamentary goodwill. If the fund is to be able to manage at all and not just go into massive debt to its own staff and creditors and become, in effect, non-functional if it exceeds its cap, where you have a situation where that could arise in any given year now because of the inability to draw upon the larger fund, in that event arising in any given year, the corporation would again be dependent upon the charity, the largess, the goodwill of the parliament. That is something which, with all the optimism in the world, I do not think we can rely upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette said, finally, why do we not just sit back and enjoy the assurances we will no doubt hear from Senator Alston and other opposition senators that, of course, they will not be miserable and mean spirited. Maybe they will not be, as individuals. I cannot imagine Senator Panizza being miserable and mean spirited. He does not have a miserable or mean spirited bone in his body. He is a gentleman. But he may not be in the cabinet. He is not yet on the frontbench and he still has a bit of distance to cover; not that there are not plenty of people that he should be able to leap over but that is another story. </PARA>

For all those complex reasons, however much you twist and turn and fiddle and fix the terms of this particular clause as proposed, we believe it is fatally flawed and we will oppose it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe this amendment is an improvement, either. I think we all clearly understand the principle that we are talking about&mdash;the quarantining of administration costs from the purpose of the bill. We understand that, but it sounds a bit like the small government argument&mdash;the assumption that everything is automatically wasteful and inefficient. I agree that that is a rather paternalistic assumption in this case, but I want to talk about the principle because Senator Chamarette has talked about the spirit of it. I think we understand that as well. Where else does this principle apply now? Are the opposition and the Greens intending to apply this principle generally in the future? I do not know whether that might make it harder or easier to vote for, but is it an appropriate principle to apply?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take an example&mdash;it is not a statutory authority, but I do not think that matters&mdash;and apply it across-the-board: think about the Liberal secretariat. What proportion of funds goes towards administration costs compared with the proportion that goes towards moneys being spent on the objective of the secretariat, which is to gain electoral success? How fixed is that amount? Where is the capacity for variation&mdash;for example, the need for extra polling because of by-elections, that sort of thing? It raises the debate that is going on in America at the moment about a balanced budget. If you are going to have a yearly appropriation, the same question applies: from where do you take that extra money?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I heard an American senator say this morning on the radio, do you dilute the social security budget? What do you do about the need for variation? I believe that the need for variation is unpredictable. For example, look at the number of Senate committees we regularly establish here and the effect that must have on the budget of the Department of the Senate. It is not to know how many committees in response to issues are going to be established on a yearly basis. So the idea of a yearly appropriation goes against the Democrats' view that we should have greater certainty of funding. I think we should have triennial funding in a huge number of instances to allow for better planning and certainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So on two grounds, firstly on the grounds of the application of the principle, the assumption that automatically the administration of the corporation will be inefficient and wasteful, and on the second ground of the inappropriateness of reducing funding to a yearly appropriation dependent on the whim of parliament when I think that a triennial fund is preferable, the Democrats cannot support this amendment. </PARA>

The Greens would have no difficulty with leaving totally free how much was expended on administration and available to Aboriginal people themselves to determine within their own priorities if it were a larger amount.

We do not want to be paternalistic apart from fact we are only giving $45 million a year instead of the $200 million a year we are keeping in government funding' and then to say, `and we do not mind whether it all gets taken by administration or legal costs such that there is nothing available to be used for the fund.'</PARA>

We are all very interested in the principle and we certainly will not for a moment accept the concept of paternalism. What we are anxious to do is ensure that as much as possible of the funds appropriated by the parliament are there for the real purpose which is land acquisition and maintenance. The analogy you draw about the Liberal Party is quite misplaced and I will tell you why. It is not substantially relying on moneys appropriated by the parliament as much as you might depend entirely on public funding. For our part, we use that money as best we can. If we misuse it then those who suffer are the members of the party at the polls and the people&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

If, for example, you were 30 per cent ahead in the polls and this mob were dead in the water you might spend a lot less than if it was very close.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely, but that is because those funds are used in an entirely private and discretionary manner whereas these funds are appropriated by the parliament. If what the parliament seeks to do is to ensure that as much as possible is used for land acquisition and maintenance, then I would have thought that if you are going to come back to the parliament to ask for an increase you would be much better off coming back asking for more in administration. If you found, for example, that they were subject to a whole swag of very expensive court cases then you have the capacity not just to ask for $3 million plus indexation but to ask for a lot more for administration. Whereas, if you went down the other path, you have to come back and ask for the real moneys to be appropriated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the government presumably does not have any target in the mind, it seems to be quite relaxed about the possibility of substantial portions being eaten up by those sorts of special claims being made on the fund. If that is the case, it would then ultimately be left to the vagaries of the parliament to try and top up the process after the event. This at least gives you the opportunity to decide whether or not you think administration expenses are under control and to provide for the funds accordingly. </PARA>

If it does, as I think it does, then I cannot see how you could ever be in a situation where no funds could be appropriated until the parliament had identified the precise sum in excess of $3 million. I do not think we need to canvass what might happen down the track with a change of government other than to say that this legislation makes it perfectly clear that the parliament is expected to appropriate that money&mdash;it does not say `may appropriate' it says `to be appropriated'; that is a command&mdash;and I think any reasonable person looking at the legislation would assume that what would happen is that, as a matter of course, an amount of least $3 million would be appropriated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must have missed something there because 121 plus zero does equal 121. The problem is that section 193(5) talks about the consolidated revenue fund being appropriated for the purposes of this section. You cannot appropriate an uncertain amount. You can appropriate in accordance with a formula, as the existing clause does, but once you add the additional element in that formula about an appropriation of an additional $3 million plus a year&mdash;and the plus is an uncertain factor, as it needs to be for good policy reasons&mdash;then you cannot have an appropriation which actually bites here in terms of the actual bill or act as it will be.

In particular, they stem from the fact that ILC money is supposed to come by way of draw-down from the land fund, and the money is appropriated from consolidated revenue into the land fund rather than being appropriated from consolidated revenue directly to the ILC.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">" `(4)  In performing its land acquisition functions, the Indigenous Land Corporation must take reasonable steps to inform itself whether any interest to be acquired in land is subject to native title or native title rights and interests within the meaning of section 223 of that Act.'.".</PARA>
<PARA>We saw recently in South Australia the rather tragic circumstances of an Aboriginal person being killed in a dispute over land. There have been some other incidents of disputes over land and there have been assaults and rather violent confrontations. This amendment purports to avoid that situation arising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, the coalition thought it would be wise for the Indigenous Land Corporation to make a non-claimant application in an area where it thought there might be native title in order to clear the slate, to make sure there were no existing native title claimants who might come along at a later stage, after the land had been acquired and given to another Aboriginal group, and challenge that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it seeks to do is avoid confrontation between those Aboriginal people who cannot maintain a claim for native title and those who can. There are areas on the fringes of regional centres and the more remote parts of Australia where this could well be the case. In fact my state of Western Australia has, I would suggest, great tracts of land where you could possibly have the ILC going to acquire a station, for instance, for Aboriginal people under this scheme and find that there are native title claimants in the area. In fact there are presently native title claims&mdash;the Miriwoong-Kadjerong, for instance, which covers a good many pastoral leases which the Indigenous Land Corporation might otherwise be interested in obtaining for other Aboriginals who cannot make a native title claim. So that was the rationale behind this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But as I said, during the course of evidence it was indicated for two reasons that a non-claimant application was not a good idea. The first was that it would unduly tie up the Indigenous Land Corporation in sorting out the question of native title; that is, a non-claimant application under the Native Title Act could take many, many months and there would be no action in the interim and you would not get anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect is perhaps a more fundamental concern and touches on the legality of it; that is, in order to make a non-claimant application there is a body of opinion which is developing, and I believe so in the Native Title Tribunal, that you must have an interest in the land before making a non-claimant application. This is where I think the Native Title Act is going to have to be looked at because the non-claimant application was brought in for someone who is going to do something in an area where there were no native title claims pending. The person intending to do something could bring on the issue, bring it to a head so to speak, by making a non-claimant issue and asking, `Is there any native title claimant out there?' That was basically the purpose of it. That could then result in clearing the decks or flushing out any claimants in the alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a concern that you just cannot willy-nilly make a non-claimant application. You have to have some sort of nexus with the land in question, some sort of legal interest. Of course, the Indigenous Land Corporation would not have that necessary tie with the land where it is approaching the land ab initio and is about to purchase it or lease it in some way. That might then preclude it from making a non-claimant application. So the modification to this amendment was done in relation to evidence received during these hearings. I commend the amendment to the chamber. I believe it is in a preferable form to that which was hitherto couched. </PARA>

It is the case, as quickly became apparent when we all went back and looked at the provisions in the Native Title Act, that the ILC would simply not be able to make a non-claimant application in most of the situations here in contemplation because of the need for anyone making such an application to have an interest in the relevant land.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that you are, in the guise of doing something that is a model of sweet reason, obliging the ILC to go down a path that will place unnecessary and onerous burdens upon it and, in particular, potentially expose it to quite a lot of litigation and certainly an enormous amount of delay in the performance of its functions. What exactly are reasonable steps that the ILC must take in determining whether the land is subject to native title rights or interests is uncertain in the nature of things and the nature of language. What constitutes reasonableness is a matter about which people can and do argue. Moreover, they can argue about it in court, because that is a question that would certainly be justiciable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about here is not just taking reasonable steps to determine whether someone has some claim that they want to make which the ILC ought to take into account as part of its general cautionary approach to making sure that it is acting consistently with the philosophy of the legislation. What you have got in the way in which the provision is drawn is an obligation on the corporation to inform itself whether any interest to be acquired in land is subject to native title or native title rights. That is an immensely difficult thing to establish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know how complex the whole business of determining native title is. It is not just whether someone is making a claim or whether there is a potential complication in the acquisition; the corporation has to take steps to inform itself whether the land is subject to native title or native title rights and interests within the meaning of section 223 of the act. That is no short or limited inquiry. That is an absolutely major exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, it is qualified&mdash;it says `reasonable steps'. But, as I have already said, what are reasonable steps in all the circumstances is very much a matter to be resolved by the courts, and it will certainly be the subject of a process of litigation to establish just what that means. We need a further process of litigation impacting on the corporation like a hole in the head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that needs to be said is that the ILC itself and its immediate staff cannot be expected necessarily to have the expertise and resources to perform this kind of investigation. If it starts acquiring the body of expertise and resources to do it, it will add very substantially to the administrative expenses that we have been discussing under a previous amendment. Moreover, as a further practical problem, the requirement that a competing native title claim be effectively decided prior to the acquisition of land means that opportunities for the purchase of land are bound to be lost while that process is undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover again, there is a further practical problem. By flagging, as this process would, the ILC's interest in a particular parcel of land, the investigation of title would almost certainly lead to vendors thus armed and informed demanding a higher price for the land in question, thus generating less value in the land fund dollar as a result. Each of those matters I have mentioned might individually have only a small impact. That is perfectly possible, but cumulatively, or in some cases individually, they might well have a very major impact indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, you have a situation where, at first blush, you look at this amendment and it looks reasonable. Of course the ILC should have regard to some likely claim that may be hanging around, because the basic point of this exercise after all is not to trespass in the area dealt with philosophically and practically by the Native Title Act. This is to enable the acquisition of other land which does not necessarily have any traditional connections at all in order to meet other objectives&mdash;to meet the land needs of the dispossessed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, it does not look unreasonable, and I acknowledge that.

The government is genuinely concerned about these kinds of provisions littering the bill. They are among that series of provisions which I have previously elsewhere identified as `the seven deadly sins of the legislation', because their cumulative impact on making the bill unworkable in practice is simply immense. </PARA>

What it has are situations where someone has come in and said, `Look, we want to claim this area' and it has referred them to one of the representative bodies or sent them away to rejig their application. It is able to tell us whether a claim has been or is yet to be accepted or not.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the question of what reasonable steps should be taken; they are readily ascertainable. What this simply says is that the ILC goes to the Native Title Tribunal, makes an inquiry, and perhaps makes one or two inquiries in the area where the land is.

So you are stuck with the terms of your own legislation. If all it involved were the ILC informing itself of what is actually around and it taking that into account in its own judgment as to whether to proceed or not, there is no hassle about that. I am sure the ILC in practice would do just that before acquiring a piece of land. As a practical matter, it would inform itself in that easy way by going to the registers and asking what is before the registrar that may not have been on the former register at this stage. There is no reason why it should not do that, and I am sure that, as a practical matter, it is a very simple inquiry. It is just like going to the titles office and seeing what is on the list.

It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle of ensuring that the rights of traditional owners be protected was strongly supported by many witnesses. The issue of the potential for conflict where due consultation with traditional owners does not occur is considered in the discussion of Amendment 26 below.</PARA>
<PARA>It is that reason for which this particular amendment was put in. It is a response to concerns. I was there and repeatedly we heard people say that, while they do want to benefit from the land fund, they do not want to benefit at the detriment of people who may be found to have a legitimate native title right.

In that process you are going to refine or sift through those which might have a native title claim.

That must be tied back to a land acquisition function.

But if we can improve it to the point where it is workable and acceptable we will grab it because we believe we have a responsibility to the Aboriginal people to do just that. We think we have demonstrated our bona fides in this respect by having accepted 28 amendments, a number of them against our better judgment in the sense that we did not think they were strictly necessary, but very helpful. We have accepted 28 amendments with a view to getting something acceptable out of this process. So please, let us have no more of that, Senator Chamarette. It is unworthy of you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of a redraft of Senator Ellison's amendment 3(f), we have a draftsperson with us. She has put something in my hand which I think does what was described as the mechanical job quite succinctly and quite well. What is proposed and what we would suggest as an alternative to Senator Ellison's amendment 3(f) is this language:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In performing its land acquisition functions, the Indigenous Land Corporation must search any relevant registers of the National Native Title Tribunal to ascertain whether any claims have been lodged or accepted or determined in relation to land under consideration for acquisition.</PARA>
<PARA>We will circulate it later, if you like. I honestly think that meets the kinds of points that emerged in our debate earlier on so far as the objects in Senator Ellison's draft of 3(f) are concerned and what is practically, easily do-able. Whether or not it needs to be in legislative form is another question, but we would accept a provision in those terms if that is helpful in getting agreement on that particular area of contention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to proposed fourth amendment 3(h), in regard to the sheet that is before us and the government's attitude towards that, this again is one of those amendments that has caused us some difficulty because, on the face of it, it seems another model of sweet reason but in practice would, we believe, operate to make life very difficult to the point of unworkable for the tribunal. We took the view originally that the reference to having to consult traditional owners created exactly the sorts of problems I have been talking about in relation to having to identify individual native title rights or interests, that it demanded attention to a very complex issue, would not easily be able to be satisfied as a practical matter and would open itself up to litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are proposing to modify that and not have a reference any longer to traditional owners but rather to people with traditional or historic links with the land in question. I am afraid the difficulty we see with that&mdash;and I say this again in utmost good faith&mdash;is that there is still a statutory requirement to identify certain people and consult with them. We believe that that statutory requirement will be very difficult to satisfy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will certainly increase the risk of disputation and legal challenge by people who claim such links if they have not been consulted or they have been insufficiently consulted&mdash;and you know the range of responses that the administrative law system is capable of delivering to those sorts of arguments these days. It certainly means that the consultation process will be even more complex. If anything, because the category of traditional historic links with the land is even wider, there will be greater delays and risks that opportunities to purchase land will be lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further possibility&mdash;and I am really just anticipating everything I was going say in relation to amendment 3(h), and I hope we do not repeat ourselves unduly as a result&mdash;that traditional owners, strictly so-called, and those simply with historic or traditional links with the land will turn out to be different groups with different views. It is perfectly possible to envisage a course of events in  relation to a particular piece of land where the traditional owners have moved off and gone to another location and some other people have come in and established themselves historically, maybe 50 or 60 years ago, and are known to have come from another part of the country but, nonetheless, established this degree of association with the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the facts of the matter, one can easily envisage, because of the difficult, sensitive and rather fractious nature of the issues we are inherently dealing with here, that contention can arise. There is likely to be conflict about who has the greater attachment to the land in that sort of circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, it is important to keep the basic philosophy of this legislation on track&mdash;that the ILC be wholly sensitive to the reality of possible traditional ownership claims or related claims over the land in question. We do not want this particular legislation to be crashing in in areas where it may well be possible for the Native Title Act to apply in its own terms and to create confusion. If humanly possible we want to avoid that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where these regional strategies come in. There is a provision for consultation with all relevant people and the defining of a regional strategy, but it is nothing like as precisely crafted and it is not in the context of particular pieces of land and does not, as a result, lend itself to the same sort of possibility of disputation and litigation which is the problem with these kinds of provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do believe that it is appropriate that there be some consultative process and that is provided for when the regional strategies are being put together. That is exactly what the regional strategies are all about; to develop, particularly in areas like the Kimberleys and so on, an approach to land acquisition and management which will juggle and balance the competing options of action under the Native Title Act on the one hand and action under this legislation on the other. It is not likely to be an issue in Victoria or New South Wales, but it is certainly likely to be an issue, juggling and balancing those considerations, elsewhere in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the place for that process to work itself out. We would thoroughly expect the ILC to undertake that kind of task in much the same way as ATSIC presently does. Again, however, there is no need for that more precise, more formal legislative prescription. It really will have the potential to significantly hamstring the operations of the ILC as so many of these other amendments will do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing wrong with this in principle and I am not suggesting for a moment that there is that kind of objection to this provision or to 3(f), for that matter, in its present form. The problems with these provisions are wholly practical in character, but it does not make them any less potentially devastating in terms of their adverse impact on the legislation. That is why we will oppose that. You should take what I have said into account. I hope it does not make life unduly onerous for you in coming back and considering a change to 3(f) on its merits, but that frankly will be our position on 3(h). </PARA>

<PARA>It is no more explicit than that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, I suppose that leads on and gives a suggested way through your second question. It may be possible to modify 3(h) by saying something along the lines that the ILC `may consult' such persons rather than `must, taking all reasonable steps to consult,' those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having traditional or historic links with the land. The difficulty about that is that it sounds a bit weaker than, in practice, I think it would be the disposition of the ILC to do. </PARA>

I am not sure that you were listening before when I said another kind of problem that can arise is the potential conflict between traditional owners, properly so-called, and those with historic and traditional links. These are not fanciful concerns.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have the further commercial problems that flow from this. Once you create these statutory obligations upon the corporation to embark upon this consultative process with various people who are defined in various ways, you build in delays, you make it that much more difficult for them to get the kinds of deals that maximise the bang for the buck in terms of available funds and you generally create obstacles left, right and centre, even short of litigation obstacles. </PARA>

That amendment states, `Before the Indigenous Land Corporation performs a land acquisition function . . . it must take all reasonable steps to consult those Aboriginal and Torres Islander people having traditional or historic links with the land.' We originally used the term `traditional owners' of the land and that caused some consternation, as I mentioned previously, because there was difficulty in understanding exactly what a traditional owner was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was suggested by the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement of South Australia that an alternative phrase could be used whereby we stated `those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having traditional or historic links with the land'. There were a number of witnesses who said, `If you talk about traditional owners, that really is not a concept which we know because we don't have ownership as such as you have it under the Torrens system and common law; we have an ongoing association with the land based on cultural and traditional links.' That is what the High Court said in the Mabo decision and it related to such things as traditional usage of the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, a good many witnesses thought that the principle was very good but we just did not have it right with the traditional owners.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Page 30 of the report. The council stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With our applications to ATSIC in the past, we have always had to provide an account of consultations with the traditional owners because we end up in a terrible fight afterwards if we have not done it properly. There have been some cases where a lot of grief has resulted because there has been a perception that only some of the traditional owners have been made beneficiaries of the acquisition whilst others have been missed out. . . So I have to say that there is a definite need to sort out the traditional owner question. Once you cement the wrong group or only half of a group, as the people owning the land, you need more than a shoehorn to get the others into the picture after that, you know. You can have a terrible argument.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that vividly put the scenario as to what you can get if you do not consult with traditional owners. I appreciate that Senator Gareth Evans has pointed to the regional strategy function in the bill. Of course 191P(5)(a) states that, in consultation with regional strategies, the Indigenous Land Corporation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">must, if any part of a region is included in the regional area, consult the Regional Council for the region&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is straightforward. But, in 191P(5)(b) the corporation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">may consult with such other persons and bodies as the Board considers appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee showed an overwhelming support, after hearing the evidence, for consultation with people with traditional or historic links to the area, and by leaving that in that form&mdash;`may consult with such other persons and bodies'&mdash;it was just too nebulous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that Senator Evans has mentioned that we are casting an onus on the Indigenous Land Corporation, but it is done for a good reason: there has been concern expressed that there should be some directive&mdash;that these people who have these traditional links should be consulted. So that is why we state that the Indigenous Land Corporation must take all reasonable steps&mdash;and `reasonable' has been included to alleviate the onus&mdash;to consult with those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having a traditional link with the land. If you leave it up to the ILC just to consult such other persons and bodies as it sees fit, you are not addressing the concerns that we heard before the committee that you should have this directive there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the coalition sticks to this amendment. It is one which I believe the government recognises as a principle, and Senator Evans has said that he has great difficulty with the efficacy and practicality of it. I think I understand Senator Evans correctly when he says that the principle might be fine, but the practicality is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that this principle is one of the most serious principles in the land fund bill, because what you are doing is ensuring as much as possible that there is not this conflict between those who cannot claim native title and those who can. What we are endeavouring to achieve here is that you do not have those altercations such as we had in northern South Australia when someone was tragically killed, you do not have the confrontations that might develop and you do not get into the mess that the Cape York Land Council has said that you can get into if you do not consult with traditional owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Cape York Land Council says that it even gives an account of its consultation. It might run things very well, but there is differing opinion across the country. I base this on evidence taken over the course of 10 hearing days while travelling 12,000 kilometres around the country to capital cities and regional centres. It is not always done that way. People are saying, `We want some directive to be given that the traditional people are consulted in an effort to avoid this potential confrontation.' The tragedy would be if this land fund bill effectively were to work to cut across the bows of the Native Title Act in the way that by this confrontation it possibly could. The coalition is saying that this consultation is essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the ILC did not take those consultative steps, then I believe that it should be held to account. I believe that the traditional people should be allowed to say, `Well, look, this body disregarded a directive contained in the legislation; it should be brought to account.' There is nothing wrong with a group or body, such as the ILC, being held accountable to the Aboriginal people themselves.

I think it is no bad thing that that take place. I am not saying that I relish it&mdash;I do not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not. The amendment is framed, I think, quite simply and explicitly. It says that it must consult with those people having traditional or historic links with the land. There may be some people in the area who have traditional links, and we should consult with them. There may be people, however, who have historical links with the land. There is a difference between `traditional' and `historical'. In some areas we might have a group which has had an historical association with the land which has been brought about perhaps by white settlement in that they were shifted into the area&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this amendment seeks to do is to include both. If we said `traditional and' we would be making it much too restrictive. We would be saying that we would have to have both. That would be a hard bill to fill. By making it in the alternative, we do not have to choose one or the other. We can have a variety. We can have perhaps one traditional group and two historical groups. If we are dealing with a large tract of land&mdash;say, a pastoral lease of some thousands of square kilometres&mdash;we might have at one end a group that was moved there by, say, a mission or that there had been some resettlement; and at the other end we might have a group which has traditional ties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ellison knows that I would be the last person to pick nits about drafting in these matters, but he has not addressed the title of the subsection which still reads `Permission of traditional owners'. Since we are no longer talking about traditional owners and we are no longer talking about permission, it would seem that you had better delete that and substitute an expression like `consultation'. Perhaps you can move accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have previously indicated, the government does have a basic problem with this. It is not a problem of principle and it is not a problem of believing that the ILC should not have regard to the views of people that satisfy these descriptions. Of course the ILC should inform itself in the best possible way it can, particularly when plunging into a land acquisition in some sensitive area where there may be competing claims of this kind. That is exactly the same point I made before. But it is much better, I suggest, to rely on the good sense of the people that we put on the ILC board to engage in those consultations, to the extent that they think is appropriate, helpful or workable in the particular circumstance, rather than to create a statutory obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not disagree with what Senator Ellison said about people with both historic and, alternatively, traditional links with the land being part of the relevant pool of people whose views may ultimately be very relevant. I acknowledge that there is a distinction between historic associations and traditional associations. I do not disagree with any of that. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I disagree, and the government still fervently disagrees,  with putting all this in the form of a statutory obligation. Once you do that, you create a situation where this becomes a subject, potentially, of endless legal disputation. The very breadth of the range of interests that you talked about as potentially being in competition with each other indicates the extent to which there might be an encouragement to actual litigation in situations of this kind. If people do see an historic interest at odds with someone else's traditional interest, that is the kind of context to which they are more likely than not to want to take such legal remedies as they perceive are open to them. Every time you draft these things in statutory form, you create the capacity for that kind of effort to occur and kind of inhibition on the ILC's performance of its functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the business of property acquisition involves swiftly taking advantage of a market opportunity. What you almost completely deny with these sorts of provisions is any capacity in the ILC to do just that. You have got to give some credence to the good faith and the capacity of people like Lois O'Donoghue sitting up there in the gallery&mdash;as she so often is, listening intently in these debates to what we are all saying. You have got to give some credence to the good faith, the goodwill and the good sense of people like this who have been living and breathing these issues for years and who will be sitting on the board in one capacity or another making these decisions. We can afford to do that. We do not need to put it in statutory terms knowing, as we do, the downside risks of it. If you do want to have some sort of touchstone or benchmark in the statute, the most that the government would be prepared to accept is language saying that the ILC may&mdash;not must take all reasonable steps&mdash;in its absolute discretion, consult those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having traditional and historic links.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed with interest that at one stage Senator Evans talked about needing to move quickly to take advantage of a market niche. I would have thought that that would be the last thing the government should be seriously regarding as a priority in this area. In other words, the whole essence of Aboriginal culture, I would have thought, is not simply to rush in and make a fast commercial buck. It is to ensure that as many people as possible are comfortable with the decision made, and their forms of consultation and decision making may well be a lot slower than ours and may ultimately be a lot more enduring as a result. Therefore, I would not have thought that speed was of the essence. What is important is getting it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underlying concept is to consult as widely as possible. In picking up Senator Kernot's point, consultation with those with traditional or historic links would generally be a wider group than owners. To the extent that we were wanting to ensure that both owners and others were consulted, this form of words allows us to do that. There should not be any need for conflict between those two groups. Above all it is seeking to make it clear, not just to the ILC in some sort of heavy-handed fashion but to the community at large, that we expect good faith and we expect consultation to be as widespread as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the real concerns I have is that, for example, the ILC might think that it needs to act quickly. It might therefore think&mdash;after having spoken to an eloquent and persuasive spokesperson, representative, trade union official or whoever else it might be&mdash;that this has the flavour of having to consult with only those with traditional or historic links and that it does not need to consult with the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the lessons that would have come out of Senator Ellison's inquiries is that, just as there is a great deal of concern about ATSIC running its own race rather than taking enough time to consult with all those at the bottom of the pile&mdash;it is like the frontbench being accused of not consulting the backbench&mdash;we ought to go out of our way as much as possible to ensure that we take everyone with us. We do not want a situation where we might simply be consulting with a spokesperson who purports to represent a large number of those with traditional or historic links. We want to make it clear that we expect the ILC to take all reasonable steps to consult as widely as possible. If we do it in that fashion and the ILC acts in good faith, as undoubtedly it would, we would absolutely minimise the prospects of litigation or legal challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What puzzles me is that, as I understand Senator Gareth Evans, who has alway been an enthusiastic advocate of administrative law, in relation to the concept of reasonableness he is quite comfortable with that in other contexts. The ability to bring a challenge where people are able to establish that not all reasonable steps were taken is one that ought to be there, not only as a last resort avenue to seek redress but in the first instance to put the onus on the body in question to do what we would expect it to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case and everyone acts in good faith, as they do 99 per cent of the time, they would not be likely to be facing massive and regular litigation. So I find it a trifle odd that, although in every other area Senator Evans is comfortable with the concept of reasonableness, which goes to the heart of administrative law because it gives ordinary citizens the opportunity to go in and simply argue whether or not they did the right thing&mdash;it is not some arcane legal notion&mdash;suddenly here he raises this spectre of massive and endless litigation.

What I would contest is the necessity or, in this instance, the utility of multiplying invitations to people to challenge the exercise of administrative discretions in areas where there are sufficient safeguards, we believe, in the way in which the institution itself is constructed and the way in which its obligations are framed, to make that unnecessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

On your more specific point about this particular proposal and the desirability of there being some sort of consultative process before this provision takes effect, let me say with the upmost respect that I am not sure you have carefully read what this particular provision is or carefully noticed where it fits in the scheme of the legislation as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a provision which requires consultation before the corporation performs a land acquisition function. It is not about consultation before the vesting of land so acquired; this is only before acquisition. While there may well be a case in practice&mdash;and it is in this context that I was largely acknowledging it before&mdash;for the ILC to be as well as informed as it can be before making an actual vesting function determining who is going to be given the joint title or whatever to the land in question, while there may well be a case in that context for it informing itself as best it can, there may equally well be a case for it to move very swiftly to take advantage of a market opportunity in order to buy a particularly obviously attractive piece of land and then sort out later precisely in whom that land might most appropriately vest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are imposing much too difficult an obligation upon the corporation to have it embark upon this potentially very wide-ranging consultative process before the acquisition itself occurs. I have acknowledged previously that of course it is desirable for the corporation to have regard to what the kinds of interests are likely to be in that part of the country. I would envisage in the development of regional strategies it would take that into account and it would certainly be sensitive to possible conflicts between traditional owners who may well have a right under the Native Title Act itself and other people who may at best have only a possible access to land under this. Of course it will be engaging in that kind of balancing act in practice. But, again, subject to formal statutory provision and the possibility of endless amounts of disputatious litigation flowing from that, to require it to go down this particular path is not to go down a path that is going to be workable. </PARA>

Once you concede the need for some degree of consultation or some opportunity for consultation, then you are arguing about degree. The last thing you want is to have an acrimonious taste in the mouths of a substantial proportion of those who might have had an interest in the issue because you happened to rush in and say, `I've got the views of the key people in the community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very substantial decision. You buy in haste, you repent in leisure. As you understand, the politics of that would simmer on endlessly if people felt that they were not adequately consulted. I would have thought you would err on the side of caution. It is much better not to go ahead with the acquisition at all rather than to rush in, consult a few leaders, put your money on the table and then find out that the whole thing blows up. It is not simply about getting best commercial value for money; it is about ensuring that you take the community with you. That is why I find it very difficult to understand why in other contexts you are the essence of reasonableness. You do not for a moment suggest that ADJR should be dispensed with and we should rely on the good sense and good nature of the bureaucrats. There are very many situations where reasonableness is of the essence and, particularly in a situation such as this where we are going into new territory, I would have thought that the ILC itself would want to move cautiously. </PARA>

The particular clause in front of us states that, before the corporation performs a land acquisition function, it has to consult.

If the ILC does its job properly, as long as it is provable under any challenge by the people who may be likely to benefit from such a challenge&mdash;that is, those who claim they have not been consulted&mdash;then it should not have any problems.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)if a conflict arises as to the allocation of resources . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is only in that situation that you would have reference to the question of most severely dispossessed. The principle behind this is that funds are not unlimited. They are indeed limited, as was heard by the committee. When you come to a conflict of competing interests as to how you allocate your resources, you should be given some guidelines. The Indigenous Land Corporation, in the performance of its functions and the exercise of its powers, should be given some principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government quite correctly recognised that there would be principles which the ILC should adhere to. This is nothing unusual. In fact, it gives the ILC a charter to work to and it makes its job a whole lot easier. The coalition has changed its view of the wording of `most severely dispossessed'. Our amendment before the chamber reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)if a conflict arises as to the allocation of the resources of the Fund, priority is to be given to those who suffer most disadvantage in relation to access to land or who are unable to gain substantive title to land.</PARA>
<PARA>During the hearing of evidence, the committee heard that, whilst those individuals and organisations appearing before the committee had no problem with the principle, they did have problems with the wording. Some suggested that the ILC may not be the competent body to work this out with complete discretion; that is, if we leave it entirely up to the ILC to work out where it goes when there is a conflict of funding. The suggestion was that we refine that phrase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter Yu&mdash;I quote from page 18 of the committee's report&mdash;stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the reality [is] that there are varying levels of disadvantage . . . throughout the country.</PARA>
<PARA>He pointed out that it would be sensible to assist `those who are suffering the most disadvantage in terms of access to land'. The phrase `access to land' is incorporated in the coalition's revamped amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Pearson, the executive director of the Cape York Land Council, told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is a substantial fund available under New South Wales legislation, so we have to query whether funds ought to be made available in that state. They have a fund that, at the end of the day, is going to equal what the rest of us have together . . . In Queensland, the board may take into account the fact that some people have had some of their traditional lands gazetted as available to claim, so they do have an avenue. They would be reasonable things for the board to take into account. In other words, some people do have title to land by virtue of it being gazetted and some people already have a land fund available to them in New South Wales. This is what the wording says as it now stands. We take into account those who suffer most disadvantage in relation to access to land or an inability to gain substantive title to land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives a marker to the Indigenous Land Corporation as to how to exercise discretion when it reaches the dilemma of a conflict arising as to the allocation of resources. We see it continually in government. When government does not have sufficient funds to go around, it has to make the very difficult decision of where money will be allocated. There is perhaps no greater dilemma when one is attending to the funding for a person which is given by virtue of legislation. I suggest that a minister comes across this daily in the exercise of his or her duties, so the ILC no doubt will as well. This seeks to give the ILC some guidance as to how to address this conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other alternatives were suggested. At page 18 of the committee's report, Helen Skiadas and Katina Law of Perth, who appeared before the committee, said that one could look at those most in need spiritually, culturally or economically, those with the least access to land and those who will be most advantaged by access to land. They went on with a raft of other criteria that could be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are trying to distil the main concerns that were expressed as to how one addresses this conflict of interests. I believe that the wording, which has been taken directly from the evidence given to us&mdash;in one instance, by the Kimberley Land Council&mdash;achieves this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government may say that this might again result in administrative action and litigation. But we have to give a body of this sort some type of guideline; it would be irresponsible of us not to. More so, it would be irresponsible of us to give it guidelines that are hazy and ambivalent and open to interpretation. What we have done in a very succinct way is give this body a coherent direction as to how to apply  funds when there is this conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the amendment to the Senate. I do not think it will pit Aboriginals against Aboriginals. It has a good deal of support. There is a majority of support by those people who appeared before this committee for this principle. It is just a question of getting it right. This modification to the amendment is much more preferable to our former amendment. The coalition has quite rightly jettisoned the term `most severely dispossessed'. It brought into argument the fact that some people might not be dispossessed while other people might. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence that we received in this committee was that all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been dispossessed. That was the starting point, but from there on you might have degrees of disadvantage, and it was perhaps divisive to talk in terms of degrees of dispossession. That is why it was jettisoned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These terms are not divisive. They do not excite controversy. I do not believe they in any way go to excite conflict between people. It is reasonable to say,` Let us look at those who have suffered most disadvantage in relation to access to land. If there is perhaps another land fund available, that could then be taken into account.' In some areas of this country you would have Aboriginal people who do not enjoy the benefit of having such a land fund available to them. That is what Noel Pearson said. He has also said that some people have had land gazetted to them. That is something to take into account quite properly. It relates to the ability to gain substantive title to land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have taken away that question of dispossession. I believe that takes the emotional aspect out of it, quite rightly. We now look in a very matter of fact way at how we allocate the limited dollar we have in difficult circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ellison is right in saying that the original amendment was seen as the centre of controversy and caused great divisiveness. He is correct to draw attention to the evidence given by all organisations that we are all dispossessed. I know that his motives in seeking to change that wording from `most severely dispossessed' to `disadvantaged' are that it is going to work more efficiently and fairly. But I wonder whether the `most disadvantaged' test is at least equally incapable of objective measurement, as is `most severely dispossessed'. In the land fund minority report on page 199 an example is given:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To demonstrate the inherent unworkability of this formula, take the example of an Aboriginal community living by some form of agreement on another person's pastoral lease. On one view, they are not very disadvantaged at all in terms of `access to land' compared with, say, an indigenous commune in a densely populated part of a city.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one interpretation of severely disadvantaged&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On another view, however, the group on the pastoral lease can be seen as disadvantaged in the extreme, because they are so agonisingly close to the unfettered enjoyment of their heritage.</PARA>
<PARA>I guess we are saying that perhaps the word `disadvantaged' is potentially as loose a word as `dispossessed' when it comes to interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that in the committee hearings those who suggested words like this as possible circuit-breakers emphasised that the principle should be a discretionary one, not a statutory one, and that the board should take into account, if they are talking about land as one of the criteria, the existing and likely land holdings, for example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to ask, too, an equally important question: how does your advocacy of this new category `severely disadvantaged' rest with your previous amendment 25? How does it link with the health, education and housing principle? Are you taking that into account? Are you going to read the two together and, if you do, what is the result of that link? How do you determine degrees of disadvantage, given that you already have amendment 25 in place? Any formulation which attempts to distinguish between former degrees of dispossession, this time degrees of disadvantage, levels of financial hardship or whatever on that long list that you quoted earlier is still bound to produce unnecessary conflict between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I find it very hard to see it as a substantial improvement which I could subsequently vote for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This year is the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. It is being commemorated through Australia Remembers and quite rightly so. It is a fitting way to pay tribute and remember the enormous sacrifices made by Australians at home and overseas both in uniform and out of uniform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Remembers is not a celebration of war, far from it. It is a celebration of heroism, courage and sheer determination, a time to think about the terrible suffering inflicted through war and a time to give our thanks to those who served our nation and helped to protect those very things which we take for granted today. It is something which can unite us all in remembrance and reflection. As we remember the suffering and misery that war can inflict on ordinary people we should reflect beyond our own shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It saddens me that the dignity and respect engendered by Australia Remembers does not seem to extend to the tens of thousands of women who suffered terrible atrocities at the hands of the Japanese army during the war. I am of course referring to the so-called comfort women. Their plight has been mentioned infrequently&mdash;usually in the context of being one of the unresolved issues of the war affecting relations between Japan and its Asian neighbours. It should be mentioned, for the story of comfort women is not one that should be swept under the carpet or consigned to history's dustbin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week there has been a conference in Seoul in South Korea on the subject of comfort women. I understand it has been attended by delegates from Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and Japan. There was even some hope that North Korea would allow some delegates to attend the conference in the south&mdash;that in itself is a noteworthy and hopeful sign of improving relations on the Korean peninsula. Unfortunately, in a fit of pique at the last minute the North Korean regime refused to let the delegates attend. If anything, the potential involvement of delegates from North Korea is an indication of how widespread the abuse of Asian women was by the Japanese army and how even 50 years after the war feelings in the region run so deep as to almost overcome the paranoia which prevails on the Korean peninsula. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Imperial Army was one of the most brutal the modern world has seen, as too many Australians well know. Aside from the terrible toll exacted on allied personnel and prisoners of war and civilians throughout the south-east of Asia and the Pacific, the Japanese army was responsible for terrible and purposeful atrocities against as many as 200,000 women who were forced to become sex slaves or comfort women for Japanese troops. Women from Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan and the Netherlands were victims of this vile and degrading treatment in front-line brothels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the book written by one of those women, who now lives in Adelaide, is available in the Parliamentary Library. I would urge honourable senators to take the time to read it. Jan Ruff O'Herne was enslaved by the Japanese army for four years and only spoke out about the horrors she had witnessed after watching a documentary about Korean comfort women a few years ago. She was just 18 years old when she was dragged away from her family by Japanese troops in Central Java to be brutally raped and beaten by hundreds of soldiers at a brothel run by the Imperial Army. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year Ms Ruff O'Herne said it was time that the Japanese accepted responsibility for what they had done and drew special attention to the plight of Asian women who were brutalised by the Japanese. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comfort women, especially Asian comfort women, have nothing. They lost everything&mdash;they lost their families because they were ashamed to go back to their villages&mdash;they couldn't get married. They suffered so much and had to carry the burden for 50 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some people might say, `Well, that's terrible, that's history, and it happened in wartime.' But we can never allow that to be an excuse for any atrocities, in any war, at any time, by any race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Commission of Jurists investigated the crimes committed against the comfort women. Last year it recommended that each of the comfort women should be paid at least $US40,000 as compensation. It published a 240 page report which detailed the systematic brutality and the vast scale on which the atrocities occurred. Forcing women into army-run brothels amounted to war crimes and breaches of international law against trafficking in women and children, the ICJ said. The allies knew about it. They did nothing after the war to bring the offenders to trial or to try and get reparations for their victims. Make no mistake&mdash;the crimes committed against the comfort women were not one-off aberrations or isolated cases. They were part of a deliberate and ongoing campaign of brutality against innocent and helpless women and girls, some as young as 13. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the International Commission of Jurists issued its report, I had written twice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) in April 1993 asking what action he had taken or proposed to take to pursue justice for the victims of these crimes. In reply, the minister said that the Australian government would monitor the situation closely. He did at least acknowledge the evidence to support the claims inasmuch as the Japanese government itself had confirmed the Imperial Army's role in setting up and operating the brothels where women were forced into sex slavery. So there was no doubt about the veracity of the allegations against the Japanese, but we had a `wait and see' attitude from the Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the ICJ published its report later in the year, calling for compensation and fully exposing the nature of the crimes against the comfort women, I again asked the minister in a question on notice what action he had taken in response to the report or what action he proposed to take. The Japanese government had already announced that it would not be providing any direct compensation to comfort women. Instead, the Japanese government was setting up a $1 billion public relations slush fund to promote exchange programs and vocational training in countries where the atrocities against comfort women were committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that, despite overwhelming evidence and the minister's professed commitment to human rights on the international stage, this government will be letting the matter rest. It has `noted' the recommendations of the ICJ, according to the minister, but that is where it ends. I believe that is totally unacceptable. In my view, it is a total dereliction of Australia's role in the international community. It seems that an apology and expressions of remorse are all that the women victims of wartime atrocities will get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia should be pressing Japan to do the honourable and decent thing by offering direct compensation to former comfort women. Instead, we are sheltering behind the terms of the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951 on the grounds that it renounced any further claims to compensation from Japan. We are not asking for compensation for countries or governments. It is being sought for individual women, hundreds of thousands of them, who had no voice at that treaty signing but who have every right to expect their case to be heard and fairly judged, despite the passage of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only last week that Senator Gareth Evans in a speech here in Canberra urged Japan to assume a greater role on the world stage. He said that the legacy of the war years continued to weigh heavily on some of Japan's neighbours and prevented Japan from taking a greater role in regional and global affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans said that there was a real and intense closeness between our countries that has grown up over the past four decades and that ours is beyond just an economic relationship. Let us put that real and intense relationship to work by seeking a decent resolution of one of the very issues that prevents Japan from fully developing its role in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our neighbours in neighbouring countries have spoken out strongly on this. Why is Australia's voice so silent? Let us seek as a country justice and compensation for the comfort women. Only then, to use Senator Evans's own words, will Japan's Asian critics be comprehensively disarmed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I call on the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to urgently initiate an independent inquiry into the Defence Science and Technology Organisation in Adelaide because of absolutely unacceptable activities going on there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the defence department's Inspector-General has been told of a disappearance of some $76,000 worth of gold supplies from the South Australian Defence Science and Technology Organisation which was to be used for gold plating electronic circuitry components. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twelve employees with the scientific and engineering services department in Adelaide have been identified as having used these gold supplies over many years to gold plate personal items including a tombstone, baby booties, bathroom fittings, watches, a chandelier and a host of other items. There are also concerns that stringent quality assurance documentation used to itemise the DSTO's highly sophisticated circuit boards may have been fraudulently manipulated to account for the disappearance of the gold supplies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a disgraceful scandal involving not only taxpayers' money but also matters of national security. The scandal goes to the very heart of ministerial accountability and responsibility in this country. Here we have DSTO employees engaged in corrupt activity, stealing from the public purse and using the gold plating supplies for their own selfish purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gold plating examples I have mentioned are but a few of the personal abuses we know about. The mind boggles at how many more items may have been given the royal gold plating treatment, eventually finding their way into the homes of the relatives and friends of these 12 employees. It seems that this practice has been going on for some time and I suspect that the $76,000 identified as having being stolen is just the tip of the iceberg. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has very serious implications not only because of the theft itself but also because of the method used to hide these scandalous practices. Apart from the fact that we know that at the very least some $76,000 worth of gold and radium plating supplies have gone missing and apart from the fact that we know that at the very least one batch of defective gold plating stocks has never been returned to the suppliers, I remind the minister&mdash;I welcome him to the chamber to listen to this matter&mdash;that the scientific and engineering services department within the DSTO in Adelaide is supposed to be controlled by stringent accounting guidelines because of the sensitive application of these circuitry components. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, circuit boards used in weapons guidance systems require a very detailed and careful itemising of all components manufactured and used. This is done, I am told, to ensure that defective components can be quickly identified in the event of any subsequent system failure. The gold plating supplies were supposed to be carefully recorded and strictly supervised, but we now know that for many years these gold stocks literally walked out of DSTO's doors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same defence department which is supposed to be controlled by strict security measures. To cover up the theft, it now appears that those who were involved corrupted the batch files and in some cases stock records simply vanished. This is a scandal which has serious implications for our national security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reliably informed that should there be failure in any part of these gold plated circuit boards or components developed by the DSTO and used in our defence systems, we may never know if the gold plating techniques were the cause of the system failure because of these corrupted files. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about a department within the Australian Defence Force which is entrusted with highly secretive and sensitive technology and information. The DSTO in Adelaide has responsibility for conducting research and development in command and control, information technology, communications, cryptographic research including signals intelligence, and tactical electronic warfare. It is disturbing to learn that employees involved with this department have been involved in corrupt activity. The integrity of the DSTO and its security procedures have been called into question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I ask of the minister, given that he is here in the chamber, that a full and independent inquiry be established to examine this scandal. The Inspector-General, who has the responsibility for conducting an investigation, was made aware of this matter before Christmas. The Australian Federal Police, I am told, have been called in to investigate this scandal. But what do we find out about DSTO's headquarters at Salisbury in South Australia? All of these 12 employees still have their jobs. The only employees who have since been reprimanded or forced out of their jobs would appear to be those who refused to take part in this gold plating scandal or who blew the whistle. The buck must stop with this minister. He must not try to sweep this matter under the carpet but, as I have said, he must initiate a full and independent inquiry into this scandal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot for the life of me understand how this gold theft scandal managed to escape the detection of DSTO's internal security procedures. It is quite clear that this corrupt behaviour has existed for some time, and that the matters that I have raised today may only be scratching the surface. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the records that have been corrupted to cover up this scandal are perhaps a more serious matter than the actual theft of the gold. One can only imagine what impact this corruption of files could have on our weapons guidance systems, for example; and so there is a scandal here with major national implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that it is important that this be fully and openly investigated, and particularly that the 12 employees who have alleged to be involved in this scandal be brought to book; but, more importantly, it is important that measures be put in place such that this sort of behaviour can never be repeated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to January's current account deficit of $2.3 billion&mdash;the third consecutive month of $2 billion plus figures in our trade imbalance. I ask: are you aware that this trend of huge balance of payments blow-outs is now higher than the run of deficits which prompted Mr Keating in 1986 to warn that Australia was on its way to becoming a banana republic? Are you also aware that Australia's current account deficit, forecast at 5.75 per cent of GDP for this year, is the second highest in the OECD after Mexico&mdash;only Mexico is higher than us? Will you now tell the Senate what you are going to do about this chronic balance of payments crisis?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The truth of the matter is that the current account deficit on this occasion is clearly within the range of market expectations. It did fall marginally in January due to a strong increase in non-rural exports and a fall in imports. The significant deterioration in the current account deficit was to be expected, obviously, given the enormously strong growth in the Australian economy over the last 12 months and the forecast of further strong growth. You had a situation with GDP increasing by 6.4 per cent as compared with the 4 1/4 per cent predicted. Investment has grown by 24 per cent as compared with the 14 1/2 per cent that was predicted and which you lot said could never be achieved. You have had a massive increase in capital imports as a result of this growth cycle as compared with earlier periods and all of that is of course going to increase our productive capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are conscious of the need for a significant tightening of fiscal policy in the May budget to boost national savings to reduce Australia's call on overseas capital. There is a very obvious and significant difference between the economic situation now and that which prevailed in the 1985-86 growth period. You had a situation then where growth was running at about 2.2 per cent as compared with over, as we know, 6.43 per cent on this occasion. You had inflation in the latter 1980s in the last growth surge period running at around 8.4 per cent; it is now sitting on around two per cent, forecast to go no higher than 3 1/2 per cent over the course of this particular cycle. You had mortgage rates running then at about 15 1/2 per cent as compared with 10 1/2 per cent now and other interest rates in a comparable position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the truth of the matter is the whole economy is in an infinitely stronger and more balanced shape now than it has been in the past when these sorts of figures have been accumulated. We are conscious of the necessity to deal with it in the way that we will be in this forthcoming budget. The challenge is for those opposite to come up with a similarly coherent strategy to deal with this particular situation.</PARA>

It has wanted to put on the record commitments of a vague kind to something that we estimate is about $18 billion worth of outlay increases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You do not actually know what the decision is. Yesterday, I took the opportunity to explain in general terms the purpose of the discussion paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Winning markets: the next step</EMPHASIS>, which I released for comment. There has been some speculation both about what that paper says and about the cabinet decision on the issue of MFN and preferential trading arrangements. I do not intend to go to any speculation about the cabinet's decision but I am happy to talk about the discussion paper which has been distributed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central message of the discussion paper is that Australia's pre-eminent trade policy objective is market access for Australian traders and investors. The issue is not MFN or preferential arrangements. The key issue is: how do we win market access for Australian business, Australian trade opportunities, Australian job opportunities and Australian investment opportunities? The paper underlines the fact that Australia has had a longstanding commitment to the multilateral trading system based on the MFN principle, and we are not about to make a sudden U-turn in respect of this policy. This applies to our approach to APEC also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have to emphasise is that APEC is a consensus based organisation. The fact that Australia's preference is for MFN does not mean that that will automatically happen. We are saying that, if the body of opinion in APEC is in support of a preferential approach, we will consider that. We will not necessarily stand in its way, particularly if that will deliver quicker and more comprehensive trade and investment opportunities. The public policy is not about some sort of esoteric, theoretical proposal; it is about getting the best possible result in the real world.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to realise that Australia historically, despite its commitment to MFN which we retain, has been a party to some successful preferential arrangements&mdash;most obviously CER, but also in the South Pacific with SPARTECA and with Canada. We have begun a dialogue with AFTA on trade linkages, which the opposition has supported. If the opposition wants to say we should not do this, what it has to answer is: if at the end of the day the only way to achieve improved export access results for Australia is through a route with some preferential elements, would you close the door on these options? If our car industry can only achieve major improvement in access to the markets of Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia through a route with some preferential elements, are you advocating that we should go to those employees in the car factories and say, `I'm sorry, you can't have that opportunity because there is an esoteric principle that we hold to; you can't have those jobs because you don't agree with that'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not neutral in the MFN preferential debate. Our preference is for an MFN approach. But it is too early in the discussions on implementing APEC liberalisation to lock ourselves into an entrenched position. There is a long way to go, a lot of discussion to be had and a lot of external factors&mdash;like whether there is going to be a move to a new global round of trade negotiations&mdash;to be dealt with yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important thing&mdash;without going into any cabinet discussions&mdash;is: some of the most interesting options being considered to implement the Bogor declaration fit very comfortably with an MFN approach.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Cooney for his question. He has always been interested in the fortunes of Australian workers in blue collar occupations. I, too, saw the article in Monday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> raising the issue of the long-term fate of the BHP steelworks at Newcastle in New South Wales. I understand that the issue is not that BHP is considering in any way, shape or form exiting from the rod and bar product market; rather, when it is talking about investment decisions for the steelworks, it is talking about new investment in new technology at Newcastle to ensure a long-term presence for itself in the Australian domestic and international markets. I think that is good news for BHP, and it overall fits into the very positive picture that we have seen emerge for the Australian steel industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Calendar year 1994 was a record year for the Australian steel industry. It was five full years after the end of our steel plan and 10 years&mdash;a full decade&mdash;since BHP itself was thinking of quitting steel making in Australia. The Australian production of crude steel was at a record 8.4 million tonnes, nine per cent higher than the previous year and 48 per cent higher than the 1983 figure. Furthermore, this result was achieved with a more productive and efficient environment. For example, the yield of finished product from crude steel has increased from around 77 per cent in the 1970s to now around 90 per cent. BHP's steel profit for the six months to November 1994 was a record $344 million, up 19 per cent on the same period of the previous year. Steel exports last year was a record 3.2 million tonnes, with some 75 per cent of that going to the Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a good record of Australian technology. In 1994, Australia was the lowest cost producer of the 11 countries considered in the Paine and Webber annual survey. BHP's steel productivity has more than trebled since 1982, and the approach of total quality management is the order of the day at its steelworks. BHP's commitment to steel making in Australia is stronger than ever. For example, it is building a new $400 million blast furnace at Port Kembla and a $300 million expansion of the tin mill is committed. An expansion is under way at Whyalla and the Sydney mini-mill has environmental approval for expanded operations. BHP will unveil this complete strategy for Newcastle by July of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other exciting features of the entire steel industry story is that Australia is becoming increasingly regarded as a source of new technologies. CRA's $200 million high smelt project and BHP's Project M joint venture are being keenly watched by world steel makers. The prognosis for the steel industry in this part of the world is extremely good. The huge demand in China is expected to continue. The ability of Australia as a primary producer of minerals and our knowledge and capability with technology in steel making puts Australia in a position to take advantage of further downstream processing opportunities and expanding and growing our steel industry much further than it has to date. I repeat that last year was a record year for the industry. There is no doubt that this government's steel plan laid the foundations for that achievement.</PARA>

I will provide Senator Spindler with a full picture of the situation as well as with regard to both cars and parts&mdash;in fact, for Australia the figure for car parts is more important. There is a very high level of protection against Australian cars in at least some of those countries and to a lesser extent against Australian automobile components. That is an important issue and an issue of continuing interest to both the industry minister and me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade and the Department of Industry, Science and Technology have been jointly investigating market access into Asia for the Australian auto industry. We are trying to focus on ways in which we can be as effective as possible in helping our industry to get that access, which it is increasingly winning because the level of exports of automobiles and automobile parts from Australia is going up very strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to market access Senator Spindler asked whether these countries made commitments to reduce protection. Of course they have. Under APEC they have all made commitments to free trade by 2020. Three of those countries to which Senator Spindler refers&mdash;Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia&mdash;made significant unilateral tariff reductions, not all affecting cars. In some countries they affected cars, but they mainly affected many products of importance to Australia during the last 12 months. We appreciate that, and we expect that process to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not claim that that has been as a result of brilliant representations by Australia but because of international market pressures for competitiveness and for investment which require people to reduce their protection. I expect that to continue. We will continue in cooperation with the Department of Industry, Science and Technology to press for better access for Australian car exports and for automobile component exports, both of which are growing very strongly. But we can do better and would do better if the level of protection in these countries were not so high. That will continue to be a priority for us in APEC, as it will continue to be a priority for us in the multilateral round which we will seek to have resume as soon as possible, and in our bilateral relations with those countries.</PARA>

On 31 January 1995, in answer to a dorothy dixer, the minister told the Senate that the cost of implementing the coalition's reafforestation plan would be between $5 billion and $15 billion. The minister said, `So the government in pure fiscal terms will not be adopting that either.' In the cabinet submission which the minister leaked to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> yesterday, the minister is reported as being likely to ask cabinet to approve funding to implement what is, in effect, Mr McLachlan's plan. Minister, in view of your previous rejection of the reafforestation plan on cost grounds, is your latest announcement simply another pitch at getting a headline to appease the green vote when really you have no intention whatsoever of putting into effect the plan for reafforestation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Neal for her very sensible question, which is unlike Senator Macdonald's question. It is with regret that the government has received the resignation of Robert de Castella from his position of Director of the Australian Institute of Sport. Robert de Castella has brought an invaluable perspective to that job and made an outstanding contribution to Australian sport as an athlete and an administrator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his time leading the Australian Institute of Sport there has been considerable expansion of institute sports. The AIS programs have been integrated into the broader national sports system. One of his many achievements has been the development of support services for athletes, ensuring their all-round development as individuals as well as elite athletes and role models. The commitment of Rob de Castella and the AIS to the personal development of athletes has meant that, when the crowds stop cheering, these athletes can move on to new careers and have very productive and satisfying lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the extensive grassroots work that Rob has undertaken, his time at the AIS has helped raise the profile of the AIS, maintaining its integrity and its leadership role in elite Australian sport. He has played a major role in securing promotional funding for the institute and the programs of the Australian Sports Commission. We should all thank Rob de Castella for his great contribution to the institute and also to its athletes, its coaches, its administrators and to Australian sport in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I can say very strongly that Rob de Castella's resignation is not a sign that the AIS in any sense is on the wane. On the contrary; Rob de Castella has confirmed that he will be maintaining close links with the AIS. I am personally very keen to explore ways in which his exceptional skills and experience can continue to be available to Australian sport. Action is already under way to find a new director. The vacancy has been advertised widely and an executive search consultant has been contracted to identify a suitable field of candidates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In keeping with its role as leader in Australian sport, the Australian Sports Commission is constantly monitoring its position both nationally and internationally. Internal review of the AIS is being undertaken with the assistance of external consultants which will firmly focus on the continuing role and functions of the institute in order to maintain its national leadership in this field&mdash;and make no mistake; it is a very strong view of the federal government that there is a crucial national role for the Institute of Sport in the development of elite athletes in this country. The government has an absolute commitment to maintain and strengthen the position of the AIS as one of the world's great sports training centres, a position that will become more important in the lead-up to the year 2000 Olympics. I hope all senators will join me in congratulating Rob de Castella for a job well done on behalf of Australian sport.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Did the Therapeutic Goods Administration take action recently to stop a drug company in Queensland making untested claims about a treatment for menopause? What action is the government taking to stop drug companies from making such false claims?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1173" SPEAKER="Crowley Sen The Hon R.A." NAMEID="ZF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="FAMILY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When it comes to drugs and other therapeutic treatments the government is of the view that it is not sufficient to let the buyer beware. Australia has a very comprehensive system of drug registration and it is aimed at protecting consumers, stopping drug companies from making false claims and ensuring the speedy delivery of new, fully evaluated drugs. The process involves either listing or registering drugs depending on their type and what they are claimed to do. When making applications for listing or registration the companies are very well aware of the consequences of the listing or registration of drugs, in particular that they cannot promote them for other than what they are listed or registered for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the last few weeks a company in Queensland, SciNat Australia Pty Ltd, has flouted these laws in the promotion of a treatment that it brought out from Germany called Remifemin. The drug was listed on the Australian register of therapeutic goods last December for the relief of menstrual pain and pre-menstrual symptoms only. However, the company started to promote the drug, making claims which it must have known it was not authorised to make and which were totally untested in Australia, that this drug provided, in the company's words, `menopausal relief'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Therapeutic Goods Administration contacted the company immediately the promotional material was brought to its attention and informed its managing director that by promoting the product for this purpose the company as sponsor of the drug was liable to prosecution under the Therapeutic Goods Act with penalties up to $30,000. It was also advised that it was liable for prosecution for promoting a product with prohibited representation&mdash;in other words, making claims about the drug that were untested in this country. The TGA advised the company to immediately cease all further promotion of the product and I can say that the company agreed to that. It has agreed to run newspaper ads retracting its statements and requesting the removal of all offending material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is particularly important because the government is committed to ensuring consumers get information on therapeutic goods that is, in fact, verified. In this case, the TGA acted swiftly to stop the company promoting this drug in this way and provided an immediate response to the unlawful activity. If the company believes its product could be useful in relation to menopause symptoms it does have the option of submitting an application for registration or listing of the drug for this purpose and then providing the information to allow it to be tested and the scientific evaluation to be done in the usual way. That company knows it can do that and it is perfectly open to follow that course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important for people to know the facts about this medication and to warn consumers&mdash;and I am certainly happy to take this opportunity to warn consumers&mdash;about being taken in by companies that make claims that have not been tested in this country. All senators will recall the claims made about a miraculous thigh cream just a very short while ago. If consumers have any doubts or concerns about these claims or any other product claims they can certainly confirm those with the Therapeutic Goods Administration.</PARA>

The purpose of the amendment is to clarify in the Social Security Act the principle that a temporary separation&mdash;for example, where people are separated from their partners due to holidays, work or study commitments&mdash;does not qualify people for the sole parent pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security has had legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department which confirms that the law does require clarification to put this principle beyond doubt in the legislation. However, the amendment does not seek any additional discretion and is not intended to involve any changes to existing procedures. In other words, the current arrangements for women leaving a violent situation are not changed. We are aware of the concerns raised about the impact of this legislation, particularly on people separating in circumstances involving domestic violence, but the concerns are unnecessary and misleading. There is no intention in the amendment to change the current procedures or to put any additional barriers to people needing to leave violent situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The admission procedures for sole parents pay particular attention to the issues of domestic violence. Indeed, while we have a requirement that in order to be eligible for the sole parent pension claimants take reasonable action to obtain maintenance, if there is any evidence or case made about domestic violence then different arrangements are permitted. People can seek an exemption from the maintenance action if they are in fear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very appropriate for Senator Woodley to raise this concern. So many of us argued and fought for protection for people, women in particular, leaving a domestic violence situation. We certainly do not want to put further hurdles in their way if it comes to seeking financial support from the sole parent pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The referral to a social worker comes as a matter of course if there is any evidence or any reference to violence. Where a client is at risk or has left an abusive relationship, their entitlement to the pension is usually clear cut. Sometimes, however, family breakdown is complex. It does, as Senator Woodley knows, cover a myriad of situations. There are situations where claimants may not be able to say that the relationship has permanently ended. They may indeed be going through a period of separation. There may not be any evidence or even any claim that that is a separation consequent on violence in the relationship. In those cases, it is important that the individual circumstances are examined closely and that the pension not be provided, as I said for the examples before, except where there is clearly demonstrated, real need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department does have procedures to verify separation. These can include contacting external parties nominated by the client. In addition, the department has domestic violence procedures which help its public contact officers to recognise it and to provide sensitive assistance to clients who may be victims of domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important that we do not create a public perception that could deter women from applying to claim the sole parent pension in such situations, for example of domestic violence, when it will be absolutely necessary for them to have it and when they indeed will be eligible. I think we acknowledge a significant change in the sensitive way in which such people are now assisted in this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I refer the minister to the existing arrangements for the appointment by the minister of directors of the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters. Appointments are made to it by the minister in consultation with the states. Why has the minister now told the states that in future he proposes to make three of the five appointments, including that of chairman, without consultation with the states and has said that unless the states agree with his proposals he will reconsider the Commonwealth's financial contribution to the authority? Is this blatant blackmail by the minister, yet another example of his arrogant determination to exercise power to appoint political cronies to agencies within his portfolio as he has already demonstrated so amply with many of his appointments to the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an unfortunate fact that Senator Short either does not have the capacity to do the research or does not have an interest in it. If he did, he would see very clearly why the federal government has made this particular move. There has been a settled approach to the way in which directors are appointed. It was only a few months ago that the New South Wales government moved a motion at the previous meeting of the board that the board should be appointed by the Commonwealth minister on the advice of resolution of members. Basically, there was a move a couple of months ago by the New South Wales government to take whatever final say this government had in appointing members to the board of NAATI right out of our hands and make the minister and the federal government the rubber stamp. That is the preceding information on this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short can say it as often as he likes, but the reality is that we pay some $380,000 in funds for NAATI. That amount is probably 10 times the amount of most of the states. New South Wales pays over $200,000, but I am not so sure what its amount is. We pay a majority of the money. Whereas at the moment we do have a say at the end of the day as to who does get appointed, the New South Wales resolution was that all this power be taken away from the federal government. Basically we provide the funds but we have no say in terms of who is appointed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When that happened Senator Short said absolutely nothing&mdash;nothing in defence of the federal position, nothing in defence of taxpayers' money. This hijack was going on, and his mates in New South Wales would have told him about it, but there was silence from the other side and a lack of willingness to even focus on the issue. If that had not taken place we would not have had the meeting in Adelaide last week in the atmosphere in which that meeting took place. We would not have had to confront the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No federal minister, whether it is me or the Minister for Finance or whatever, would allow a situation where federal government money is spent in an area where we do have a responsibility but spent with our being purely rubber stamps. I said to New South Wales and Queensland officials last week&mdash;I met with them very briefly&mdash;`If you want to go back to the previous situation, if you want to talk turkey, we are prepared to do that, but don't ask us to be the rubber stamp when federal funds are involved and involved in such a way.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the background to this, Senator Short, and no matter what flavour you want to put add to it no matter how you want to spin it the reality is twofold: first, we are not going to absolve our responsibility and, secondly, it would really do debate in this area a lot of good if just for one moment you got out of the gutter and got into some policy. Put at your foremost consideration, Senator Short, the interests of Australian taxpayers. If we are going to be in a situation where we have no say as to how the funds are spent, where we are going to be rubber stamps, then obviously we have to consider how those fund are being spent. In that spirit of trying to work this out, I have had discussions already and I expect those discussions will lead to a constructive result.</PARA>

That is the states' position and that is precisely the sort of dissipation of federal involvement that I am not going to be a party to. In terms of what is going to happen in the future, as I said to you, but once again you do not have the capacity to listen, I have already had discussions with officials and, despite your interference, despite your negative involvement, despite whatever spin you want to put on it, despite all the politics you want to play, we will get to a constructive outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. I refer the Minister to the wildcat strike held by the Transport Workers Union refuellers at Sydney Airport on 3 November. As a result of this action, six international airlines were granted at 5.00pm an exemption to operate outside the curfew time. Why did the Minister at about 7.00pm rescind this exemption at great inconvenience to the airlines' passengers and at an estimated cost of $1 million to the airlines. Was the exemption cancelled to avoid the possibility of provoking an even larger protest against Mr Keating's opening of the third runway on the following day?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Transport has provided the following response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No. The curfew dispensations were rescinded to facilitate resolution of the refuellers industrial action.

The curfew is in place to protect the community living around Sydney Airport from sleep disturbance.</PARA>

<PARA>The former finance minister in this government, Peter Walsh, used to describe the Democrats as the `fairies at the bottom of the garden' party in this parliament. I have news for Peter Walsh: that title has been well and truly usurped by his own party&mdash;this bunch of economic vandals opposite, the Keating government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite obvious from today's figures, and from Senator Evans's answer to Senator Hill's question, that Senator Evans, the third most senior member in this government and an aspirant for the job of Prime Minister, does not have a clue about the seriousness of Australia's balance of payments crisis, a crisis due directly to the disastrous failure of the Labor government's policies throughout its 12 long years in government. I point out that, for all of this time, the chief architect of those failed policies has been the former Treasurer and current Prime Minister, Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the balance of payments figures for the first seven months of this financial year. They show the worst balance of payments results in our history. In all but one of those seven months of this financial year, the monthly deficit has been well over $2 billion. That is a huge figure that is continuing to plunge us into hock with the rest of the world&mdash;week by week, day by day, hour by hour. That is not the end of it though because, on the revised forecast of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) presented just a few weeks ago, the government expects the average monthly deficit over the remaining five months of this financial year to continue at a level of $2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the second highest external deficit of any country in the OECD&mdash;that is, in the industrialised western world&mdash;with the single exception being Mexico. That is a country that is still gripped by a financial crisis brought about by its external account difficulties.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD's forecast for Australia of a deficit of four per cent of GDP released last year will now have to be increased in line with the government's recent upward revision&mdash;that is, a figure now for 1994-95 of 5 3/4 per cent of gross domestic product. By comparison, the United States&mdash;a country which is extremely concerned about its external imbalance&mdash;has a current account deficit forecast of 2.3 per cent of GDP, less than half that of Australia's. The OECD as a whole&mdash;that is, our counterpart countries throughout the world&mdash;is virtually balanced in its trade surpluses and deficits, much as would be expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1970, Australia has recorded on only four occasions a current account deficit greater than five per cent of gross domestic product. On all four occasions, that occurred under Mr Keating's stewardship. This latest enormous, very damaging and very serious blow-out in our balance of payments comes at a time when a number of factors in the world are making markets less settled and more volatile. We have seen the Mexican financial crisis, the Barings collapse, the Orange County bankruptcy and so forth. The days of Australia being able to easily count on cheap foreign finance to pay for its beyond-its-means standard of living are fast disappearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in this situation irrevocably and irrefutably because of the government's economic policies.

As a result of that, we have seen a collapse in investment&mdash;investment which is now recovering, admittedly, but with no change in the underlying fundamentals of our economy. We have seen an eight-fold increase in our debt to the rest of the world. We have seen interest rates go through the roof to being the highest in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet from the minister's reply to Senator Hill today, there was a quite breathtaking complacency about the seriousness of our situation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the government's response? `We are on track; we are on target.' Forget the fact that the target was changed by some $8 billion only a few weeks ago. The government usually goes back in history and refers to Fraser. It does not have any plans to resolve this issue. It does not even apologise for dragging Australia down into the mire. It simply tries to rewrite history. It actually tries to mis-state the facts. Let me just briefly state the facts. When Fraser left office 12 years ago, the foreign net liability was $23 billion; now it is over $160 billion&mdash;more than seven times under this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we had the government's response to this. It is a disaster. The response was a mixture of arrogance and conceit blended with a little bit of, `Don't blame me, I'm only the Prime Minister, Treasurer, Leader of the Government in the Senate, finance minister,' whatever the case may be. It is always someone else's fault. It is never the fault of the government&mdash;that is assuming that they ever recognise there is a problem. Usually, `We are right on track.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The blow-out now is approaching some 5.75 per cent of GDP. In 1986, when the current account deficit was approaching six per cent, the then Prime Minister went on the Laws program and said, `You cannot fund $12 billion in perpetuity every year. You have to slow growth.' But when growth is less than three per cent, unemployment goes up. Then we hear those famous words which we all remember, `You have gone. You are a banana republic.' How appropriate it was here yesterday that Senator Evans was described as bananas in pyjamas. Not only is he a banana; he is in sleep mode. It is the perfect response for a banana republic. In 1986, we could not fund $12 billion a year; now it is now $26 billion a year. It is almost six per cent of GDP. So, by the government's own definition, we are on the road to becoming a banana republic. </PARA>

We all know what has happened to Mexico recently. The government is not able to tackle these issues. All it has done is to do what it did last time&mdash;put up interest rates, slug the home owners and slug the small businessmen. Worse than that, the Prime Minister has the hide to say we should be grateful to him for putting up interest rates; it is a good thing. He says it is taking out premium insurance on our jobs because, if he puts up interest rates, we keep our jobs. He ignores the fact that Australians are already paying the highest prime bank rates in the world. He ignores the fact that when interest rates go up small business, in particular, lays off people and jobs are lost. </PARA>

They can see the writing on the wall; they can see the unemployment; they can see the bankruptcies; they can see the social costs; and they can see the struggling families.

Yet Senator Evans's response was that the economy was infinitely stronger and more balanced than it has been in the past and that the government would address this in the budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to take note of the answer relating to a question about our deficit, which for successive months has been $2,300 million. I believe this is a continuing disaster for the Australian economy, more importantly for Australian workers. Imports so far this year are up $5.16 billion, or 14 per cent. Imports of consumption goods are up by 12 per cent. We as a nation simply cannot sustain these sorts of trends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular I wish to address the issue of what we are doing about the deficit. The government, when challenged on these particular figures, says again and again, `Yes, but our exports are rising.' This answer is nothing short of misleading the Senate because, while exports are rising from a very slow base, imports are rising at a much faster rate. This year we admittedly had 16 per cent export growth in ETMs and about 10 per cent for total manufactures. However, this has come, as I have said, from an extremely low base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manufacturing import growth, however, is much greater in absolute terms. Import penetration has grown to 25 per cent of total domestic sales&mdash;up from 15 per cent in the 1970s. The manufacturing trade deficit has now grown to $35.3 billion for 1994. That is the last available figure. We should note that this is up from $15 billion in 1984 and $4 billion in 1974. In other words, we continue to import at a much faster rate than we export. I believe that the government is hoodwinking this house and the community by hiding the figures that clearly demonstrate that the situation is getting worse, not better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the answer that I received today from the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, he said our imports are rising. That was in specific reference to the car industry. Let me quote an article headed `Automotive trade deficit speeds up', which was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 20 February 1995 and written by Michael Lynch. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's automotive trade deficit ballooned out to $7.3 billion in 1994, a sharp increase on the $6.15 billion motor industry trade shortfall the nation posted in 1993.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . statistics clearly illustrate the full extent of the structural imbalance in which the nation's auto sector operates. Exports of cars and parts last year, at $1.539 billion, were at record levels. But so were imports, which totalled $8.881 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the figure that Senator McMullan did not disclose to the Senate. The government does not disclose these figures to the community and does not disclose them to this house. This is the truth. This is why the trade balance that we received today is a continuing disaster. This government must take the step of taking immediate action to do something about our imports. By extending our general tariff reduction program by just one year we could raise an extra $600 million and directly tackle the current account problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government must look at direct measures to tackle imports and it must look at what I have pointed out to Senator McMullan: there is inaction on the part of our trading partners in maintaining their trading barriers while Australia continues the current trend of unilateral tariff reductions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak on the answer given by Senator Gareth Evans to Senator Hill's question today. It is quite tragic the way that Senator Evans, the leader of the government in this place, tried to answer that particular question. It is quite clear from his answer that the government is not prepared to recognise the seriousness of the current situation in terms of our current account and the fact that we are now in a trend of up around or in excess of $2 billion on a month by month basis. It is worth examining a few figures in terms of the seriousness of this problem. We only have to look at the estimate now for this year for the total balance of payments deficit of something like $26 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Senator Evans could point at today and say was, `You people won't support tax increases.' I will deal with that particular aspect in a moment. It is worth noting that in the last five years of the coalition government, before this government came into power, the total of the current account deficit was around about what it is going to be for this year&mdash;about $26 billion. It is also worth noting that in 1979-80 the current account deficit for the whole year was $1.974 billion. We have now had three consecutive months&mdash;a trend; it was an aberration last month, but it must be considered a trend now&mdash;of $2 billion more in each of those months. As has already been stated, it was more in six of the last seven months than it was for that whole year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans made the comment, `You people will not support tax increases.' Let us have a look and see what the government said about tax increases when it was politically expedient for it to do so. On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> on 19 November 1992, Mr Keating stated, `What I am promising is not to put up tax.' On 9 February 1993 the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . let me tell you something that I thought you might have known, they've been legislated. They are not a promise, they're law.</PARA>
<PARA>That is in relation to the tax cuts. We know what happened to them and where they went. There was the promise by this government to pensioners. It was stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's commitment to removing all age and service pensioners from the tax system by 1995 will benefit pensioners paid at the part rate as well as providing some assistance to retirees with incomes beyond the pension cut out point.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest very strongly that Senator Evans and the government are in no position to talk about our position as far as taxation is concerned. The facts are that they have not addressed in a proper way what is required to overcome the crisis that we now have with our balance of payments. One of the major areas which one must emphasise over and over again&mdash;and we listened to Senator Spindler and his solution&mdash;is that the real reason why we are not competitive in this country and we have imports flowing in consistently is the failure of this government to address proper labour market reform. That is the fundamental problem and issue the government will not tackle, because its masters in the union movement will not let it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is going to be very interesting today&mdash;because the Asahi case comes down at about half past four&mdash;to see what the industrial court says in relation to that particular case and whether or not we are going to see a little bit of sanity coming into what is a fraudulent piece of legislation brought in by Mr Brereton some 15 months or so ago. Until such time as this government&mdash;if it remains in government&mdash;is prepared to address that particular issue, we will not overcome and we will not address the particular problems we now have with imports flowing into this country. </PARA>

<PARA>This afternoon Senator Cook painted a very glowing picture of what is happening in the steel industry in Australia. Indeed, many of the changes in recent years have been of great benefit to this industry. It is certainly in a much more profitable position than it was before. It has moved far more into the export of product and it has become far more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to what Senator Cook said and I fear that he might have glossed over an ugly reality of the development of this industry. He did mention the expansion of the flat products division of the Wollongong steel industry, and that is to be welcomed. He mentioned the expansion of the Whyalla division, which is also to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he got to Newcastle, he glossed over what was happening up there by saying, `There's going to be new investment.' That is true; there is going to be new investment. What he did not do&mdash;I will follow this up and ask him some very serious questions about this&mdash;was indicate the nature of that type of investment and the effect that that will have on employment in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen over the last 20 years in Newcastle, in the time that I have been there, is a steel industry that has gone from employing 20,000 people down to 4 1/2 thousand people. The steel industry has improved efficiencies a great deal, and part of the agenda of the 1980s was certainly to make industrial operations more efficient. But the minister glossed over the fact that the changes coming will probably not relate so much to efficiency as to a scaling down of the nature of the type of steel that is produced and the employment that that in turn will generate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we have two fully generated steelworks&mdash;one at Wollongong and one at Newcastle. I fear that the Wollongong steelworks will be the only remaining integrated steelworks if current plans which are in place continue. The city is rife with rumours that a mini-mill will be established in Newcastle. This new investment could be related to the closing down of the integrated steelworks and the establishment of a mini-mill, something like the one in Rooty Hill in Sydney, which works on an electric process, which is not the usual way that steel is produced by coal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has ramifications right through the Hunter Valley. There will be a loss of jobs in the steel industry and, therefore, there will be a loss of jobs in the coal industry, the transport industry and a whole range of associated industries. It was very deceptive of the minister today to gloss over this fact. It was deceptive when, at a time of very high unemployment and extremely high regional unemployment, what is happening in the steel industry is likely to exacerbate this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Howard has spoken about the five minutes of economic sunlight that Australia has enjoyed recently. The sun did not come up for many areas in Australia. It certainly did not come up for the Hunter Valley.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional unemployment is rife. It is disingenuous of the minister to today gloss over this fact and pretend that in Newcastle it was net new investment when it probably would be no such thing. This industry will decline further. Unfortunately, even though the Hunter economy is diversifying at some pace, it will not be sufficient to take yet another blow to the Hunter economy by dropping employment in steel and its associated industries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We left off at the point where Senator Kernot had put to me a question in relation to the meaning and operation of this amendment.  If I understood her correctly, Senator Kernot suggested that the words `those who suffer the most disadvantage in relation to access to land' invite the same sort of conflict and concern that `most severely dispossessed' caused.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will address that question but I also need to consider Senator Kernot's other question, which was: do you read this in conjunction with amendment 25, which talks about health, housing, education and the like? The first question was put to the coalition with the comment made by the dissenting report from Senator Reynolds and Senator Lees at page 199:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To demonstrate the inherent unworkability of this formula, take the example of an Aboriginal community living by some form of agreement on another person's pastoral lease. On one view, they are not very disadvantaged at all in terms of `access to land' compared with, say, an indigenous commune in a densely populated part of a city. On another view, however, the group on the pastoral lease could be seen as disadvantaged in the extreme, because they are so agonisingly close to the unfettered enjoyment of their heritage. The prospect of complex and lengthy legal action, in this or many other particular situations that could arise, is all too plain.</PARA>
<PARA>With due respect, they have missed the point. In relation to the formula that has been expressed by the coalition you also look at those who are unable to gain substantive title to the land. Although you might have a group who have access to land, they still might deserve consideration in the event of a conflict of allocation of funds if they do not have substantive title to the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is precisely the point that Senators Reynolds and Lees were making in this minority report. They were saying that if you have these people living on the pastoral lease by agreement they have the access to the land. That is true. They say that, because they have access to the land, our formula fails them. Of course it does not, because the alternative in the formula is those who are unable to gain substantive title to the land. That was raised by Noel Pearson, the executive director of the Cape York Land Council. He said that it is not just access to land that is a yardstick of merit; it is also whether you have title to the land. He cited as an example those people in Queensland who had land gazetted in their favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when you look at the amendment, do not just look at the first limb of it, because there are two limbs. The group that is living on the pastoral lease might have access to land but they fall down on lack of title because they are there only by agreement with the pastoralist concerned. So they would not miss out. When you applied the amendment in its true form you could see how severely disadvantaged they were because priority is to be given to those who are disadvantaged in either access to land or title to land. I believe that answers the question posed by Senator Kernot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 25, which deals with health, housing and education&mdash;which all go to the viability of the community&mdash;was in a different section of the bill and dealt with the policies that the ILC, the Indigenous Land Corporation, had to adopt&mdash;very different to the principle and objects of the bill. The principle and objects of the bill are in much more general terms. They are to be found at the beginning of the bill, whereas the actual policy of how you acquire interests, manage land or give grants of money or loans, et cetera, is more the nitty-gritty of it, so to speak. Therefore, you would not read them together because one is a principle and object of the bill; the other is a policy of the acquisition of land. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind those who are concerned about amendment 25 that during the hearings there was a good deal of misunderstanding about that. The amendment talks about improving the viability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, including by addressing their health, housing, educational, economic, social and cultural needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the word `or' meant that any one of them could be considered. Not all of them had to be considered, not some of them had to be considered, not the majority of them had to be considered, but at least one of them had to be considered. It could be based on the cultural, social, health, housing or educational needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the policy aspects, but it is very different when it comes to the crunch when you have a conflict of interest in the allocation of funding and there is a dollar available and you have two very good applicants vying for that dollar. If you give both of them 50c you might not help either one of them. You might have to make a decision that one gets it and the other one does not. You may say to the other, `Come back next year.' That is an unenviable task and it is much like the discretion ministers have in the allocation of funding. This gives a principle in the bill as to how that will be done when that dilemma arises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate that you should not read that together with amendment 25. When you apply this formula you should look at the two limbs which are access to land and those who are unable to gain title to land. As I said earlier, the evidence of Peter Yu from the Kimberley Land Council was that access to land was an aspect to be considered. I will not recite again what I have already outlined to the chamber. I do believe that that assists in answering Senator Kernot's questions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has consistently opposed any attempt to have the legislation include directions on the prioritising of access to land fund moneys. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his second reading speech on the new bill that is currently before the House of Representatives drew attention to the unworkability and divisiveness of such a provision. When referring to the Senate select committee's proposed amendment, which is now before us today, to delete the reference to `most severely dispossessed' and to substitute a different form of words, the Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's solution, however&mdash;a form of words which would still seek to rank degrees of disadvantage in terms of access to land&mdash;clearly fails to overcome the objection to the original amendment. Any statutory obligation to calculate and calibrate different degrees of disadvantage is bound to generate unproductive disputation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly how we read this provision. The coalition has really just plucked another vague and undefined set of criteria out of the air as a means of determining priority. The formulation that is on offer now will lead, in our judgment, to difficulties which are equal to those arising from the original amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the ILC is in the position, as the opposition proposes it should be, of having to apply these kinds of criteria and make sense of them, that is going to make, here as elsewhere, its operation very top heavy bureaucratically and would necessarily concentrate a whole lot more decision making power in a centralised structure. Some criteria are going to have to be developed to establish the relative degrees of disadvantage and everything else that is associated with this provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we get to the problems of definitional detail. What exactly does access mean in this context? Is it to be defined in a purely physical sense? If that is right, then contemplate this: some states, and of course the Northern Territory, do guarantee access physically to pastoral leases in their legislation. That can hardly be compared to the rights which are conferred by full ownership. Is access not to be defined then in a physical sense but rather in some kind of structural sense, if I can put it that way, as in access to land acquisition programs or access to a legislative right to claim land irrespective of whether such a claim might be successful? If that is the case and if there is some notional right of access in that generalised structural sense, then you have a situation where the Aboriginal people of New South Wales would go right to the bottom of the priority list because that state does have a land rights act and does have land acquisition funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then you have the problem of how the ILC will assess, on the other limb of the equation, whether people are unable to gain substantive title to land, to use that part of the proposed new formula. Does gaining title encompass simply the ability to buy land and thereby gain title, or does it mean gaining native title through the processes of the NTA, the Native Title Act?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulties in defining these principles&mdash;the difficulties that I have identified in understanding what these words are to mean and how they are to be applied&mdash;are inevitably again, as so often, going to lead to arguments and legal challenge. They are going to lead inevitably to disputation about who has the least access, who has the most access, who has something in between along some graduated schedule and who at least is able to gain substantive title to land&mdash;however you define that. The whole amendment is an invitation to litigate. It places the courts again, I suppose, in the position of defining by exclusion who can get access to the land fund through setting aside the ILC's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The truth of the matter is that all of this is just too complex to be prescribed by legislation which is inevitably going to be the subject of litigation. The diversity of circumstances of indigenous people all around the country means that there is going to be a range of priorities. It is going to involve a lot of difficult and delicate questions of judgment and balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some groups, there is an urgency in returning to their land before their culture and their language are lost completely. They might be people who do have access to land already in the sense of the Northern Territory right of access to pastoral leases for the purposes of formally exercising at least some rights to enjoy the land in question and not having any substantive character about the legal recognition of those rights but, nonetheless, raising questions of definition and application of the kind that I have already referred to. You can have competing priorities cutting across particular individual situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we are saying again with utmost good faith&mdash;and we do not say this in any spirit of being cantankerous or just dismissive; I have tried to give a reasoned response to every one of these amendments all the way through this long debate&mdash;is that assessing priority in the allocation of the fund moneys should be left to the ILC board, which in the absence of legislative prescription will be able to take into account the diversity of needs of indigenous people in this country. It should be empowered to make its own decisions without unnecessary constraints which undermine its authority and make its job unworkable. That is our position and, there again, I am afraid that is where we are going to have to stick. We will vote against the amendment accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond briefly; I do not want to delay the Senate. Senator Evans does make the point that the ILC board will ultimately have to make these sorts of decisions at its own discretion. The genesis of the wording of the modification to the amendment came not only from the evidence to the committee where, as Senator Ellison already said, Noel Pearson very articulately described at the Cairns hearings a whole series of circumstances where it would be desirable to assist certain groups in Australia to get access to land under the land fund before others. Senator Evans, I think, alluded to that when he spoke about those who should be given access as urgently as possible before they lose any more of their culture or tradition. Mr Pearson made the point that there are probably people who have been entirely dispossessed of their land and have lost a lot of that culture and tradition. It is probably in the interests of maintaining culture and tradition to find people who have not lost all the culture and tradition and who can be reunited with some land more urgently. That, of course, is addressed by the words of this modification to the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, Senator Ellison referred to Peter Yu from the Kimberley Land Council. That reminds us that, when the first discussion about this controversial amendment in its initial form was first debated by the Senate, Aboriginal groups around the country held a meeting. I actually forget where it was held, but it was basically to resolve what was regarded by the media as a sort of north-south divide over this legislation. They did agree that there needed to be a principle in the bill. The Kimberley Land Council, the Cape York Land Council and the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council agreed on a number of things at that meeting: one, that this bill not be regarded as compensation for disposition and, two, that it not stop them from claiming compensation in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though they agreed to disagree on the words `most severely dispossessed', they did agree that there should be a guiding principle. Peter Yu and Noel Pearson both stated that to the committee and supported the broad concept of assisting those with the least access to land and the least ability to gain access. Mr Pearson said in evidence that states like New South Wales, possibly South Australia and, to a limited extent, the Northern Territory already have existing legislation to give people like that access to the land. There were other states like Queensland where that did not happen and where the priority may be greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I make is that there is a need ultimately to set priorities. The board will have to do that one way or the other. The issue then at stake is whether or not there should be a guiding principle in the legislation or whether we should just leave it to the board to make those decisions month by month, week by week, claim by claim and application by application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, after lengthy consideration and after hearing all of the evidence from the 244-odd witnesses around Australia, believes that the principle should be enshrined in the bill. I think it is fair to say that an absolutely overwhelming majority of people who came before the committee agreed that that principle should be in there. The only witness strongly against it was ATSIC. Even a number of ATSIC commissioners and ATSIC operatives on the ground around the country came forward and disagreed with the position put by ATSIC's submission. So there was overwhelmingly support for there to be a principle in there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Evans that the wording of that principle needs to be done carefully. We believe the wording, as a result of the committee's deliberations, is much better than `most severely dispossessed'. The committee and the coalition were convinced that trying to assign grades of dispossession is not only repugnant to Aboriginal people but is also probably impractical and unworkable. That we have come up with this revised wording is a reflection of the fact that the committee was prepared to do the work and listen to the voices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. I commend the modification of the amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate the Greens' support for this amendment. I am sure that will come as no great surprise to anyone in the chamber, but I will state briefly the reasons for it. The most important thing is that the failure to state a principle within the bill to assist in the prioritising of the very small amount of funds available across Australia means that some other different principle will have to be used in the operation of the fund. We need to make that principle, or whatever divergent principles are operating, explicit to avoid a de facto prioritising to perhaps a first come first served basis or to perhaps easier access to those groups who have already had the resources to work out what they need and where they need it and to be able to make their claims in an expeditious fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there was adequate funding to meet all the needs of all Aboriginal people who cannot gain land via the Native Title Act or by any other means, it might be a different question. We might not need to put a priority guiding principle within the aims and objects of this legislation. But, if I may say so, it is an extremely strange omission that a fund should be set out without any objects or principles that ensure that those who read that act will know the purpose of the funds being made available and what kinds of priorities might need to be exercised in case those funds were short of the amount required to fulfil their total purpose. Any failure to state those principles by which moneys will be allocated is bound to generate ill feeling across the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Repeatedly in the consultations that the committee took, there was anxiety as to how the extra $21 million was to be allocated&mdash;whether it was to go to every person at $124 per person per year, to every state at $2 million to $3 million per state, or divided between all states except perhaps New South Wales, which has a land council, or the Northern Territory, which has a land rights act. That anxiety was already present amongst the people who did support the need for some guiding principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has already been stated, the whole use of the phrase `most severely dispossessed' had become so detached from the context in which it was expressed, which was where there is a conflict that this kind of prioritising should be taken into consideration. That emotive usage of it by those who opposed any guiding principle being placed in the bill at all did allow many people to feel gravely concerned. Nevertheless, they all understood that when there was so little money to go around some kind of explicit guidelines would be useful and helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the amendment that the opposition has come to as a result of the committee hearings is a twofold thing: it is a sign of their goodwill politically to look at the concerns and it is also a worthy inclusion in the bill itself. While Senator Evans's view is that it is all too complex and there is an invitation for litigation, I repeat what I said earlier&mdash;that stating a principle to which the ILC can adhere to and be seen to adhere to will protect it from litigation provided it takes all reasonable steps to ensure that it has endeavoured to make a determination which relates to the purpose of the fund. After all, we were told that the purpose of the fund was to assist those who have been dispossessed of their lands. They were the Prime Minister's words and that was one of the reasons why we used those words and agreed to those words in the principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two possible reasons why the government is remaining adamant about this. One is that it may be that it wants to prioritise those groups that are more aware of what lands they need&mdash;they can actually see their country; it might be a country fund, not a land fund for dispossessed people who will not gain by native title&mdash;those who can see their country but cannot own it and who may already have a very well-founded belief that they should be assisted to help buy back that land from whatever leasehold or freehold it is under and regain their culture. I do not blame them for that one bit. But the government cannot win both ways. It cannot pretend that this is a land fund for all Aboriginal people who have been dispossessed and who will not benefit from native title if what it is really intending is for a small segment of those people to be able to gain. If it wants to do that, then it should state a different principle rather than simply leaving it unstated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason why the government may be so adamant about not having any prioritising principles in the bill is that it does not mind that the acquisition needs of Aboriginal people may well be swamped by the management needs of the land they already hold and also of any lands that may be acquired through the fund. That is one of the matters. This guiding principle that it may well be that groups which, as the Tasmanian Aboriginal centre proposed, already have land should not get more lands before other groups who have no land at all may be interfering with the government's desire that it actually use the majority or as much of the fund as is available to meet the existing management needs of indigenous held lands as well as the management needs of lands that might happen to be acquired in the first few years of the operation of this fund. Neither of those two reasons is adequate to leave at a blank. If the government does not agree with the guiding principle, it should state what its guiding principles are and put them on the table because it is not adequate to simply leave them out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposal by Senator Chamarette goes some way towards clarifying what was previously left in a wholly unsatisfactory technical fashion. The draftsmen, whose  advice I have taken, are by no means persuaded that you have succeeded in doing that. The reasoning gets a bit complicated but it is linked with how you in fact read 193(1), which another part of your amendment amends by adding to the formula the expression `+$AE'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then it becomes a question of whether or not you have been successful in your amendment before the chamber now in, in effect, removing the `+$AE' from that formula for the purposes of the point you want to make or whether rather you are stuck with that formula because of the chapeau language of that subsection which refers to the amount worked out using the following formula and the key phrase there being the amount. It may be that you have not succeeded in doing anything other than perpetrating further confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I think the intention of what you are trying to do is clear and it may conceivably be technically adequate for that purpose. I have to say that there are enormous reservations expressed in fairly robust terms to me by parliamentary counsel about the technical adequacy of other parts of the proposed amendment, but it is not my task to try to clean that up here. You have to have your own confidence in your own amendment if you are going to vote for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The short point I want to repeat is that, however successful you may or may not have been in cleaning up the technical problem to which I drew attention, you still have some other problems of a serious kind, as we see it anyway , with the clause. You have still inhibited obviously the ILC from using any of the land fund moneys for administrative purposes. It is stuck with, it is confined to, such other moneys as are appropriated for administrative expense purposes. That appropriation is manifestly not accomplished by this legislation; it has to be accomplished each year by a new exercise by the parliament in appropriating $3 million or $3 million plus for that purpose. So the first problem is that you are in the hands of a cooperative parliament if the organisation is not to be stymied from the outset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, you have the further problem of the possibility for various reasons of overruns in administrative expenses in any year, which again throws the ILC back at the mercy of the parliament and government of the day for some extended supplementary appropriation to enable it to get through that particular year. In general, it does cut across completely the principle of administrative autonomy which has been the touchstone for all similar commercial corporations and it really is a pretty heavy-handed feat of paternalism to apply this constraint in the name of giving the ILC a new funding opportunity. What you are really doing is applying a new constraint of a paternalistic kind. So whatever the technical adequacy of what you are trying to do may or may not prove to be, for all those other reasons we oppose the clause as proposed now to be amended by Senator Chamarette. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this bill be now read a third time.</PARA>
<PARA>I do want to make a couple of points. The first point is in relation to something that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said yesterday in the House of Representatives and something I think Senator Kernot and others have said in relation to what I am supposed to have said on public radio; that is, about the coalition supposing to have done a backflip on this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the day the committee report was tabled, I did canvass what will happen to the bill, subject to how the government responds to it. I made it clear that there are two or three alternatives. One is that the amendments be insisted upon when returned from the House of Representatives, which is something I expect would and will happen. The second is that, ultimately, if these amendments to the legislation were never made, the only hope those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would have of achieving control of their own land, in the terms of the amendments moved by the coalition and supported by the Senate, would be, indeed, with the election of a Liberal or coalition government at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We feel quite strongly that the outstanding issues do come down to whether or not a bureaucracy has or individual communities have ultimate control of the land that is granted. I take this opportunity to describe why that is so important to us and why some of the government's objections, as put by Senator Gareth Evans here and by the Prime Minister in the other place, really are not matters that should be of overwhelming concern, nor should stop the passage of this bill, as amended, into legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the amendments that were tabled by the Prime Minister in the other place yesterday, specifically being the amendments that are now the matter of disagreement between the two houses of parliament, The first one is so-called amendment No. 3, which has now been agreed through the processes of the Senate this morning. That related to trying to find out if native title existed before land was purchased. That has now, through some horse-trading on the floor of the Senate, been agreed. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Gareth Evans" NAMEID="VD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a totally different form.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a different form. But ostensibly it achieves what the coalition set out to achieve in the first instance, even though the government and the Senate have found a set of words that is more precise in ensuring what the ILC would have to do prior to purchasing land&mdash;and that is a very sensible outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments 4 and 5, of course, just a few minutes ago were modified by the Senate to remove the contentious words `most severely dispossessed' and replace them with a principle that is broadly supported by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia, although with the exception of some people in ATSIC here in Canberra. That has just been debated and I will not re-enter it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next amendments, Nos 6 to 17 and other ones, relate to the provision in the bill that says that only corporations should hold the land. That is something that received widespread support and, again, as said in the committee's report, should not overly concern the government. The coalition and the senators who supported the amendment believe that to prescribe that only corporations should hold the land is unnecessarily proscriptive and rules out a whole range of other legal entities that could emerge for Aboriginal land ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard much evidence in the committee hearings that the corporate structure, although it is culturally relevant in some cases, is entirely culturally irrelevant in others&mdash;and the Torres Strait Islander people were one particular example. But there is a range of other Aboriginal people who will continue to be dispossessed because of the wording of the clause in the original bill without amendment. It does not mean that the ILC is forced to grant land to other legal entities; it just means that it has the flexibility to say that there is a whole range of other legal entities that could be granted land. That, I think, is desirable. It actually increases the flexibility of the ILC and meets the government's own principles in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effectively, all that amendment No. 25 does&mdash;that is the so-called health, housing and education amendment&mdash;is to broaden the things that the ILC should take into account when granting land. We should read very carefully the transcript of the Prime Minister's speech to Hopevale last Friday on what was, until he got there, a secret visit&mdash;because I spoke to a few people in Hopevale on the morning the Prime Minister was arriving there, and most of them did not even know he was coming. But let us not be too political about that because at Hopevale, the Prime Minister&mdash;if we can get through all the waffly aspects of his speech&mdash;indeed, gave true recognition to the fact that health, housing and education are important consequences of assisting Aboriginal people to buy land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the government has ever contested that. It says that there should be some sort of strict delineation, and that this bill should only talk about land and not about other things. But, of course, the bill does talk about other things; it talks about cultural, environmental and other benefits that can flow from owning land. If we want a most&mdash;I will not say `articulate' because that is not fair to other people&mdash;thorough support for the position that health benefits can flow from the ownership of land, then I recommend to the people of Australia a reading of the transcript of Mr Keating's speech in Hopevale. He very effectively links health with ownership of land in, I think, the same way that Senator Lees referred to spirit sickness and the fact that, when people are alienated and cut off from traditional lands and their source of cultural, spiritual and traditional enrichment, their health can suffer&mdash;and the coalition recognises that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment does nothing more or less than that. As Senator Ellison described earlier in the committee stage of this debate, it certainly just asks the ILC to bear these things in mind when making its grants. It is not proscriptive, it is very flexible and it does nothing to fetter the ILC's operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel that the sorry part of the debate on this particular amendment is that it has been politicised&mdash;and possibly from both sides; it has become a bit of a political bellwether in this whole debate. But really, if we look at the guts and effect of the amendment, it should be seen as something that we should not waste too much time arguing over because it is a broad statement that most people agree with, and it certainly has no restricting effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 27, dealing with the ILC not to retain interest in lands after they are granted, again is something that I just simply cannot see as objectionable and I cannot see why the government is so adamant about opposing. I then move to amendment No. 32, which is the disposal of the land. The government, I think quite sensibly, links this with amendments 6 to 17 in relation to corporations being the only bodies that can hold land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was Senator Collins in the debate here last year who said that, under our provisions, an individual could be given land one day and could go out and sell it the next. This has created the illusion that these two sets of amendments together create some sort of structure that is going to see various Flash Harrys get granted land and then dispose of it the next day for personal profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cold hard reality is that the ILC will make the decisions about who it grants the land to. It will decide whether to grant it to a corporation, to a trust or to some other legal structure. The effect of our amendment is to ensure that the people who are granted the land have some ultimate control over what happens to that land. That is the thrust of all of our amendments. The government says that amendment 32 will allow the land to be sold frivolously and for individual profit, but that is not what is intended, nor what would happen in reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately&mdash;and we were given evidence all around Australia to this effect&mdash;in some circumstances land should be able to be sold readily so that the communities can take advantage of other opportunities that might present themselves. On the other hand, many Aboriginals said, `We do need to protect land that has cultural or traditional significance to us.' Amendment 32 does nothing to stop that from happening. All it does is put the control over that decision making into the hands of the Aboriginal landholders, into the hands of the community and into the hands of Aboriginal people, as opposed to being in the hands of a Canberra bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the landholders want to ensure the land is not sold without ILC permission, that can be achieved by way of a caveat on the title. Again, it would be a decision made by the Aboriginals themselves. It puts the control into their hands. If they want to ensure that that land is never sold without ILC approval, then that is something that they can determine for themselves. We think that is preferable to allowing the ILC to have ultimate control over the land in all circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the idea of placing trust and responsibility in the hands of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander landholders is very important. We would genuinely and sincerely ask the government to revisit the effects of both amendments 6 and 17 and subsequent amendments relating to allowing only corporations to own land, and we would ask it to revisit the effect of amendment 32, which gives the power to determine what happens to that land to the individuals, the corporations and the communities&mdash;the Aboriginal people&mdash;as opposed to a bureaucracy here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly do not believe that you create self-determination by giving self-determination to a new bureaucracy and giving it that independence. Ultimately, self-determination is about empowering the Aboriginal people, their organisations and their communities. Without amendment 32, you do not do that. You give self-determination to a bureaucracy, and giving self-determination to a bureaucracy is very different from giving self-determination to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I cannot see how the government can oppose amendments 33 and 35. I can see that it may strongly want the ATSIC chairperson, or that person who holds that office from time to time, to be on the board. But my understanding of amendment 33, which was passed last year, was that it does not preclude that person from being on the board; it just says that they should not be on that board as of right. Equally, I cannot see how the government can possibly oppose an amendment  that states that the board should be broadly representative of the Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, one thing that arose from the evidence to our committee&mdash;and the evidence was absolutely overwhelming&mdash;was that there was this distrust by Aboriginal communities right throughout the country that they were not being properly represented by bodies such as ATSIC. That was not entirely surprising. It is not a criticism of ATSIC; it is a classical problem.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Kernot" NAMEID="XW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator Kernot</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do you think that we adequately represent white Australians?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was actually going to say the same thing, Senator Kernot. Senator Cooney made the point very well when he spoke to the tabling of the committee report that, whenever you seek to set up some sort of democratic structure, there will be those who feel that they are not being represented by it. I am sure there are millions of Australians out there who do not believe that everything that happens here in Canberra, even with our very best intentions, is in their best interests. That is all I am saying. I am not surprised at that evidence. I am not personally criticising ATSIC on that aspect, nor have I.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is that, overwhelmingly, the people who gave evidence to the committee said, `We want an elected board; we want to be represented by the board; and we want it to be broadly representative.' People who have read the report will note that we proposed a better alternative structure. The committee proposed an indigenous land council which would be a body broadly representative of Aboriginal people and that the board itself would be the more day-to-day executive of the Indigenous Land Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that a number of the government's advisers who travelled around Australia with us are here in the Senate today. I hope that they will have told the minister and the Prime Minister about the overwhelming feeling of those who gave evidence, and that we have proposed a structure. It was obviously a matter which was too hard for us to deal with through this process, but there was an overwhelming feeling from the witnesses, and it was represented in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Kernot particularly was not very happy with the process. She has a massive gripe with the way the Senate select committee undertook its operations. I am not going to respond to her because I was personally and deeply offended, but she is entitled to her view. I think that, if she carefully read the transcripts and looked at the way we went about our operations and if she spoke to some of the witnesses who came forward to us and warmly received what our committee was doing and commended us for the way we did it, she might perhaps recant from the views she has expressed. I will say no more about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was something that was so strongly supported that I cannot see how the government can continue to oppose it. With the national and regional strategies, even those who came along to the committee and put the ATSIC position almost pro forma, when asked by people like my colleague Senator Ellison whether they thought that the regional strategy should be the foundation stone of the board's operations, the ILC's operations, and whether they agreed that the national strategy should come after and reflect what happens in the regions, overwhelmingly supported those propositions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot ever see how the government could oppose it, especially when we bear in mind that Senator Gareth Evans came across here with a proposed amendment which says, `Let's wipe out the national strategy altogether; let's not have one.' I just wonder why the strategies should not reflect the regional strategies. It makes a lot of sense to the people out there. Clearly, that commonsense does not prevail here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 63, which provides for extra information to be put into the annual report, is something that I would expect the government to see as fairly incidental, but it is something that is hard to argue against. One other amendment is the important one that says that the ILC should be required to consult with traditional owners, as they were originally called. We were convinced by the evidence that that should be changed to those people with historic and traditional links to the land. Again, that was something that was just so strongly regarded as crucial to the sensible operations of the ILC that there was virtually no opposition to that idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, many of the witnesses to the committee said that, if you do not have that sort of consultation, then you will create a conflict and potential violence, as in the recent case&mdash;I think it was the day before our hearings in Adelaide&mdash;in Marree where there have been disputes between competing claims. Even the government said that it would attend to that as a matter of course and it should not be prescribed in the bill. That was something that was so overwhelmingly regarded as crucial to the proper operations of the ILC that it should be prescribed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's own record on consultation on this very legislation has created mistrust in many Aboriginal groups. The government may say it does not respect the fact that we spoke to something like 244 witnesses and that it does not respect the views of all of those people, but the reality is that there is mistrust out there. There is a feeling that Aboriginal people are not listened to, that they are not spoken to, that they are not consulted with and that they are not part of the process. Again, that is not something that is surprising to us. There are probably lots of people out there who feel that they are very remote from the processes of this parliament. Aboriginal people are probably not orphans when it comes to feeling remote from the processes of government in Australia&mdash;be it state, federal or even local. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal people believe that it should be prescribed in the bill that people with traditional and historic links be consulted. They do not trust us. They do not trust the government. They do not trust the ILC when it says that it would do this anyway but do not tell it to do it. When we say to Aboriginal people that we are from Canberra and that we are there to help them, they do not really take that very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that all of the outstanding disputes between the two houses of parliament, as reflected in the government's second bringing of the bill into the House of Representatives, are matters that need not be fundamentally disagreed to in the two sides of this argument. They are not so fundamental that they cannot be discussed, negotiated and agreed to in the way that matters like amendment No. 3 have been agreed to. That was agreed to on the floor of the Senate today. We have come a hell of a long way through this process to get virtual total agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the main outstanding issues are the principles in amendments Nos 4 and 5 as amended&mdash;the fact that corporations are allowed to be granted land under only the government's unamended bill, the disposal of the land and the consultation with people with historic links. These are things that I believe are extremely workable. I do not believe the government's arguments that they are unworkable. I believe that ownership of the land can be protected where it needs to be protected by the amendments to the bill. It is fundamentally wrong to restrict to corporations land-holdings by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Many people out there do not want corporations to be the legal entity by which they hold their land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government would be dispossessing those people. It is saying that it will not give them land unless they are a corporation. The government would be continuing the dispossession by doing that. It is discriminatory; it is wrong. I cannot see why the government has such an enormous problem with this. If there were a spirit of cooperation, these things could be solved. I certainly hope that that spirit of cooperation will emerge over the next few days or weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forcing people to own land as corporations because we believe corporations create some sort of higher accountability is patently incorrect. In recent years we have seen in normal public companies that accountability cannot be obtained&mdash;even with the most onerous black-letter law. As we have seen with the Australian Corporations Law, we cannot legislate for accountability. Corporations have not necessarily been successful under the Corporations Act or the previous state corporate codes. Of course, in the case of many Aboriginal corporations again accountability has not been achieved just because there has been a corporate structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, the problem of accountability can be solved by ensuring that those who hold land are accountable to themselves, their brothers, their sisters and their communities by putting responsibility into their hands. That ultimately will be what solves those sorts of problems that have been raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by commending that this bill be read a third time. The coalition has come a long way on the land fund bill from when it first heard about it. The coalition has moved from being very dubious about the land fund bill to embracing it as a concept and to supporting, as we are about to do, the third reading of this amended bill. I genuinely encourage the government to look very carefully at where there may be agreement on some of the outstanding issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is not at all surprised that the opposition should now have moved to a stance of supporting the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill on its third reading because the bill we have before us is a very different bill from that with which we began. It is a bill which is now, as a result of the process we have been through&mdash;after some 31 hours of debate, 26 of them in committee&mdash;in our judgment fundamentally flawed in a way that simply does not justify or could not countenance the government supporting it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that I am a little puzzled by Senator Campbell's speech. I have known for a long time that there are two Senator Evanses in this chamber&mdash;me and Chris Evans. I have known for some time that there are two Senator Macdonalds&mdash;Senator Sandy Macdonald and Senator Ian Macdonald. I did not know until a few minutes ago that we have two Senator Campbells. We have the Senator Campbell who went public on 9 February and said all sorts of things like `when push comes to shove the opposition will accept'&mdash;with such graces it can muster&mdash;`the government's bill' and `leave it until such time as we are&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Campbell" NAMEID="H15">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I get a copy of that transcript?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have the transcript; I am freely translating. He said, `Leave it until such time as we are in government and we will fix up the defects that exist.' I thought a copy of the transcript had been passed to me, but it turns out to be Mr Tickner's release. However, he does use quotation marks and he is a very reliable witness. Mr Tickner has recorded Senator Campbell as saying that the reality is that, with an election coming up in a year's time, forcing the hand on the coalition's proposed amendments probably does not achieve much. Senator Campbell basically said that the opposition would leave these things to be fixed up when and if it gets the opportunity to do so when it is in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then today Senator Cambell, after making a gesture of a marginally conciliatory kind by saying that maybe there could be a process of further negotiation&mdash;this was, mind you, after 26 hours of committee debate and 31 hours altogether&mdash;said we could find some way of bridging this divide after he had just spent 25 minutes explaining in elaborate detail how wide it was. The truth of the matter is that there is a very wide divide now between the opposition and its soul mates in this enterprise, the Greens&mdash;it will be fascinating to see how they vote on this occasion&mdash;and the government on the worth and the workability of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I spoke last by way of wrap-up in this debate back on 16 November, I identified what I described as the seven deadly sins in this legislation&mdash;seven factors about the bill, as a result of the opposition and Green amendments, which make the bill indefensible in principle, unworkable in practice or both. As a result of the further four hours of debate we have had today, a couple of those concerns have been marginally ameliorated but not to the extent of removing the sin in question from that particular description. They do remain sins because for one reason or another they create a bill that is indefensible in principle, unworkable in practice or both. Let me quickly indicate again those major concerns, which are points of absolutely no return so far as the government is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sin No. 1 is the requirement that the ILC give priority now to those who suffer most disadvantage. True it is that is a little bit better than the previous reference to `most dispossessed' from one point of view. But, as I pointed out at great length in the earlier debate&mdash;I will not repeat it now&mdash;that is likely to cause very significant conflict in the indigenous community as to who satisfies this description. It opens up the ILC to legal challenge about who actually satisfies these criteria. It is administratively a nightmare in terms of the demands that it will create for some kind of calibration of competing claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sin No. 2&mdash;and it is one that has not been addressed in any way, shape or form by the opposition or the process it is so proud of, the committee&mdash;is the reference to grants to individuals and trustees being possible. That is absolutely wrong in principle as far as we are concerned and as far as, we believe, the majority of Aboriginal people in this country are concerned. It is contrary to the whole aim of the land fund, which is to provide communal benefits. It is contrary to traditional indigenous land holding practices. It has the incidental operational disadvantage of reducing accountability; but the basic problem is the one of principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third sin is the requirement that grants of land have regard to health, housing and so on. That is contrary, as we have said, in principle to the purpose of the land fund, which is to provide land as a basis for the wellbeing of indigenous people. It is not intended to address what are absolutely legitimate but quite distinct objectives of other programs&mdash;other programs which are not the responsibility of the ILC. Requiring the ILC to have regard to the implications of these sorts of factors&mdash;health, housing, education and so on&mdash;when it is making grants of land is again, we believe, to make this particular proposal very difficult to apply in practice and to open up, again, the administration of the corporation to challenge and to many practical difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth deadly sin is the requirement&mdash;altered to some extent today, but not in such a way as to get rid of the basic problem&mdash;for the ILC to consult, before acquiring land, those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having traditional links or historic links to the land in question. On the face of it, it is not a unreasonable aspiration, but one that in practice will, we believe, simply be quite unworkable&mdash;leading to conflict as to who precisely satisfies the description, certainly generating extensive delays while people are identified and consulted, and certainly creating not only the possibility of inhibitions on the ILC's capacity to operate effectively commercially, but also exposure to litigation and all sorts of practical difficulties to the point of making the corporation, with this provision alone, quite unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth sin goes to the business about administrative expenses. It is not a cap in quite the same direct terms that was originally proposed. It is a different sort of provision requiring a separate appropriation at what will, in effect, year by year, be a capped level for administrative expenses. We believe that is offensive in principle to the extent that it imposes an unprecedented paternalistic restriction on a statutory authority. We ought to have confidence in the boards to do what we appoint them to do and it will create&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator Campbell</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is how you fund ATSIC at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, ATSIC is not restricted in the amount that it can spend for administrative purposes. That is another furphy you were determined to promote earlier on by implication and it is one that needs to be directly replied to, as I now do. ATSIC is the subject of an annual appropriation, but it is not the subject of any restriction&mdash;direct or indirect&mdash;on what part of that appropriation it can apply to administrative expenses. That reflects the reality that there does need to be flexibility if any operation is to be workable in practice. You have the further problem of being a prisoner of annual appropriations by the parliament and top-up appropriations in the event that unforseen&mdash;albeit perhaps perfectly defensible&mdash;additional expenditure is required to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sin No. 6&mdash;and it is an important one again, a deadly one&mdash;is the removal of the ILC power to control effectively the disposal of land. That is absolutely indefensible in principle because it would lead dramatically and, we believe, inexorably to the diminution of the indigenous land base, the erosion of the land base which is the whole purpose of this legislation to create. There are some gigantic accountability problems associated here with expenditure of public moneys. You are talking about potentially making very large sums of public money available simply to support private individual acquisitions of land which can then be freely traded, and utterly miss the point, which is to create a new permanent land base for Aboriginal people to be enjoyed on a communal title basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seventh sin goes to the whole group of proposals relating to regional strategies and, to some marginal extent, the national strategies provision. The sin here involves not so much any problem of principle but an operational problem: a massive increase in the complexity that will be necessarily involved in the formulation of these strategies, opening up yet more avenues for legal challenges to ILC decisions and, in that context again, making the ILC, we believe, unworkable, and reducing the possibility of the capacity of the ILC to take advantage of commercial opportunities to purchase land as they arise&mdash;just generally being another whole layer of unacceptable inhibitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So they are the seven deadly sins. In addition to that there are several what I might describe as venial sins, if Senator Harradine will forgive me for this foray into what has previously been his domain in this chamber. I would describe venial sin No. 1 as that going to the requirement for the ATSIC chairperson identified by official designation to be removed. That requirement, which is there in the original bill, for the ATSIC person to be there would no longer be there and there would be only one ATSIC commissioner on the board rather than two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since ATSIC is overwhelmingly the representative body for Aboriginal people in this country, it is quite inappropriate, in our judgment&mdash;particularly given the role that ATSIC has been playing in this whole area of land acquisition and vesting in Aboriginal people and the overlap period of five years that lies ahead&mdash;for ATSIC to be treated in this way. That reflects merely a political agenda rather than a legitimate practical one so far as the opposition is concerned. Senator Campbell has made perfectly clear what he thinks about ATSIC on multiple occasions. We will not get into that debate now, but he is not its biggest fan. I think he cheerfully acknowledges that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have become a statesman in your old age after all. Amendment 27, I think, constitutes what I describe as the second venial sin, and that is the business about the ILC pursuing a policy of not retaining any interest in a parcel of land which it has granted. I perhaps should say a word about this, because we have not addressed this is in the course of these current debates. It is certainly the general intention that the ILC would not, at the time of granting land, retain an interest by granting some lesser interest such as a lease where the ILC has acquired a full interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it was always the government's intention that it should be possible for the ILC to later take out an interest in land that it had granted in order to assist land holders to manage their land. For example, it might retain a leasehold interest in return for managing the land on behalf of the owners. There might be other commercial situations of that kind. It is not a major inhibition on the operation of the ILC. It is in the realm of the venial rather than the mortal; nonetheless, it is an inhibition on the effective operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is amendment 63, which I described as venial sin No. 3, which goes to the ILC annual report. The bill already requires detailed information on the operations of the land fund to be provided to parliament. This really is a provision which would enable the parliament, or some opposition so minded that happened to have a working majority in one house, to impose obligations upon the land fund and the ILC which are really beyond that which is necessary to ensure full accountability. We made these points in the course of the general debate and made all of them, at one point or another, at much greater length than I have done in this third reading reply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that all of these sins together make up a bill which, in its present form, simply cannot now be supported by the government. I repeat: we are determined to get a workable bill that is defensible in principle into place as soon as we possibly can. We are not playing games in order to use this bill to pursue other political objectives. We want a bill that works. We want a bill that is effective. We want a bill that is defensible, I repeat, in principle. We have not got such a bill at the moment. If the Senate nonetheless is minded to give it a third reading, the government will obviously act accordingly in its further consideration of it&mdash;beginning with, I have no doubt, a rejection in the House of Representatives of all the amendments to which I have referred today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens have indicated all along our rejection of this fund because the amount is totally inadequate. We sought to bring in another two amendments, apart from that which sought to increase the amount of the land fund, which we believe were very important to Aboriginal people. The first amendment allowed the capacity for native title equivalent to be brought to bear on any land that was acquired by the land fund. The second amendment, which was the concern of many people, required that the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill expressly state that it was not constituting compensation and would not disqualify Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islander people from pursuing any compensation claims that they held.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that we do not support this fund and totally reject the inadequacy of it, we have continued our attempts to improve the bill in the direction of concerns addressed by many Aboriginal groups around Australia. Those groups indicated through submissions, contact with us or contributions to the committee which travelled around the country that this government designed and apparently ATSIC approved bill did not reflect their needs and aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the Senate has arrived at an amended bill which is far superior in its response to those concerns than the original bill proposed by the government. We would like to support the bill in some ways. We certainly prefer it to the original unamended bill, but it falls far too short of what we consider to be the minimal requirements. The bill does allow greater self-determination to Aboriginal communities and greater flexibility in their holding and managing of land. It is more explicitly respectful of traditional and historical links with land and the different kinds of disadvantages experienced by all Aboriginal people as the result of white occupation of their land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if this bill is passed, it will bind Aboriginal people to a pittance of the land fund not just for the 10 years for which it is set up but forever. It may keep the government off the hook in respect of its human rights obligations to the original owners of Australia and it may give the appearance to the international community that justice has been done, but make no mistake: justice will not be able to be done and the government's moral obligations and also those of this parliament will continue into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens cannot support the bill, but we do not feel totally comfortable about that. We are opposing the third reading stage of the amended bill for two reasons. Firstly, out of the lesser of the two evils&mdash;the two evils being this amended bill or the government's legislation as reintroduced and as originally devised&mdash;the amended bill wins. Secondly, while it is by no means what we support, we do not necessarily want to deny those few people who will gain from the $21 million a year more which is being allocated to the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not be supporting this bill and thus the government has the opportunity to indicate whether it is prepared to respond to the requirements of parliamentary democracy and to hear the voices of all the Aboriginal people who have felt excluded not only by the government's consultation process in determining the bill but also by the government's refusal to tolerate any amendments presented in the Senate which reflect their concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is apparent from the extraordinary action of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the House of Representatives yesterday in pre-empting Senate process by presenting the land fund bill for a second time that the government is stubbornly persisting not only in its disregard of the democratic process of the Senate but also, and worst still, in using the highly questionable political prod of the double dissolution threat to try to force its way through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Greens voted against this bill now, we would be assisting the government in proving its highly dubious case. We would be sharing its highly dubious role in this place. We will therefore place on the public record that the Greens will be abstaining from this third reading vote in order to leave the failure of this bill in the hands of the government and those who agree with that position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me put on the record the fact that the Democrats want to have the opportunity to vote to establish a land fund for Aboriginal people. Let me also put on the record that, in the course of our 30 hours of debate, some quite reasonable amendments have been made. But I also think some totally unacceptable amendments have been made. Unfortunately, it is the matters of big principle, in my view, which fall into the unacceptable category.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us remember that the purpose of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill is to set up a structure to facilitate the acquisition of land and its maintenance for indigenous people who do not benefit from native title. Let us leave aside the comments about whether or not the amount of money is adequate. Most of us believe that, in terms of addressing the huge need that is out there, it is not an adequate amount. The Democrats cannot vote for the bill in its amended form, but it is not over whether ATSIC has one or two commissioners on the board or over the renaming of the title of the bill or over the place and function of regional strategies. We cannot vote for this bill due to our strongly held views on three key principles. I do not need to go to the seven so-called deadly sins. There are three really clear areas for the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first area is the attaching of conditions such as those relating to health, housing and education to acquisition and maintenance of land. We feel very strongly that this conflicts with the fundamental notion of citizenship rights. We should not be attaching or qualifying purchase or acquisition of land in any way, in my view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area on which we disagree seriously is, I suppose, the cumulative effect of a couple of amendments which we believe have the serious potential to erode the very purpose of the bill, to erode a land base. Those two amendments are the grants to individuals and their right to dispose of the land. We can point to an example in Alaska, I think&mdash;certainly in North America&mdash;where at the end of a certain number of years no land was left and the whole purpose of the legislation was defeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area is the way in which the coalition and the Greens have sought to have the land corporation give priority to the most disadvantaged. I agree that that sounds fine in practice, but I feel strongly that it is similarly incapable of objective assessment, as was the former version of priority to the most severely dispossessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is a clear-cut matter of what constitutes self-determination and what does not. I think it is more difficult than that. But to me it comes down to a matter of collective rights to communal benefits to be held in perpetuity over the individual right to acquire and dispose of land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge Senator Campbell's comment that the opposition has come a long way in this debate. That is certainly true. He entreated us to consider the points of principle the opposition spent so much time debating. He expressed the hope that in the next couple of weeks we might come to a different consensus. I put a similar challenge to him: he should re-examine some of the arguments that the government and the Democrats individually are raising in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps Senator Campbell is of the view that the bill the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) introduced in the House of Representatives yesterday, which incorporates 27 of the Senate's amendments, provides a better balance between the views of Aboriginal people represented by peak bodies and those who are not. But it seems to me that no land fund bill will adequately represent and satisfy the views of all Aboriginal people or all of us here in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the final consideration that has guided the Democrats is that we cannot agree it is better to have nothing than to have this land fund in this form as amended by the amendments incorporated in the House of Representatives bill which was introduced yesterday.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that worries me about this whole situation, particularly the one that has developed in the last two days, is that it has become highly political. That is the last thing I thought we needed when dealing with this question concerning Aboriginal people. After all, the constitution was changed by an overwhelming vote to give certain powers to this parliament and to recognise the position of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was the landmark High Court decision in respect of Mabo. People like me, who have had a long history of understanding and support for Aboriginal aspirations, were very pleased with that landmark event. I remind the Senate that, when we came here, one of the first things we did was adopt a resolution in support of Aboriginal people. On that occasion, I quoted Miriam-Rose Ungunmerr-Baurman, an Aboriginal artist in the Daly River, as saying that the period of grieving must give way to a future of joy and inspiration, the period of despair must give way to a future of vital action and the period of grim endurance must turn into a period of vigorous growth. I thought we should be doing just that: setting the stage for vigorous growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the saddest reflections of where we are at this time in our society is that the number of Aboriginals employed in Australia is lower now than the number employed in the Great Depression. Admittedly, some who were employed in the Great Depression were employed in slave labour situations, which I am not advocating. However, one thing that will empower Aboriginal people is gaining creative employment. One thing I thought would come out of this ILC is the provision of moneys for the acquisition and management of land that would enable the further employment of Aboriginals in a situation where they would have dignity and control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very disappointed&mdash;I cannot say that the situation is hopeless&mdash;with the sorts of attitudes that are now  developing. The best thing for the Senate to do is to adopt the resolution, adopt the third reading and send the legislation back to the House of Representatives. It is noteworthy that fewer people were in the House of Representatives during the committee stage debate&mdash;and they had a very poor and short committee stage debate&mdash;than were here in the Senate. From time to time a number of honourable senators have come into the chamber. As we know, we have all got other things running concurrently. At present I should be at a meeting of another committee but this, in my view, has taken precedence.</PARA>

Senator Campbell seems to have come a good way on this. Maybe I have got him wrong, but from what he has stated&mdash;and there is some difference about that&mdash;the opposition has come a long way on this matter. The government is taking a bureaucratic led attitude which I do not think is appropriate in these circumstances. I feel that we should adopt this legislation having regard to what the opposition has said&mdash;that if there is any way that the remaining areas of difficulty can be resolved then let us see it. But do not just use this as a political football, as I believe it has turned into, because of the circumstances of yesterday&mdash;introducing another bill into the parliament when we have given the government's bill our due consideration and when we have spent hours doing it.

Senator Harradine referred to the overwhelming support of the Australian population in 1967, which is nearly 30 years ago, to the amendment to subsection 51(xxvi) of the constitution.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the government would regard this as a special measure. We regard those citizenship rights that Senator Kernot is talking about as citizenship rights. The reason we have special measure legislation, both under our constitution and under the international covenants that prescribe these things, is that we require special measures to ensure that some racial or other minority groups actually achieve those citizenship rights. I do not think Senator Kernot would say that most Aboriginals enjoy those citizenship rights. We require a range of special measures, all of which the coalition has supported over the decades and is supporting now, and land is one way of achieving that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I will refer to is the general concept of what happened in America in the last century. Senator Kernot will have viewed the video <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Contrary Warriors</EMPHASIS> that has been floating around which goes into some detail about the effect of the 1887 General Allotments Act, particularly in the state of Montana where they split up blocks of land into 160 acre sections and gave them to individuals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's legislation, which has the support of the Democrats, that excludes all of these possibilities. Nothing in our amendments excludes giving land to corporations and ensuring the ILC has the final say in whether they sell it or not. With our amendments it would be an inclusive bill that gets a third reading. The government's bill is exclusive. I urge the parliament of Australia to support an inclusive approach to this legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Senator Teague's distress is evident and, I believe, genuine. There is a convention in this place that where people have missed a division through misadventure of some kind or another of a reasonably plausible kind it is allowed for the matter to be put again. I might say that we have all suffered a bit of misadventure in this case. Our misadventure happens to be the absence of Senator Devereux lately of our ranks, who is overseas at the moment, unpaired, and who would unquestionably have been here voting on our side of the equation producing the result we just had. So be it. We have to tolerate that. Equally, we have to bear with such fortitude we can command the likely result of this division now if Senator Teague does take part in it. So we will not stand in the way of the matter being recommitted.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The misadventure was that there was a one-minute division bell and some people were not able to get back in time. It was partly our fault because a minister is always under instruction if there is what we call a mickey mouse division, if I can put that on the record, to interrupt debate to make sure it is a four-minute bell so that ministers can get back here. That is the only point I make. The last time this happened there was no graciousness. We moved 12 motions and had a division on every motion to reflect the will of the Senate. I just hope the graciousness that our leader has shown today is repeated when misadventure occurs on other occasions. That is the only point I make.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate that the opposition will be supporting the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994. The bill proposes to provide the classification of publications, films and computer games for the Australian Capital Territory. When this is through, it will form part of a national system for classification and enforcement of these classifications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill's main purpose is to establish the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board to administer this particular act. Classification decisions are to be made in accordance with the national classification code which is set out in the bill and guidelines to help apply this code. The bill does give effect to community concern about X and R rated material on computer, video and film. Overall, this bill is a triumph, I think, for cooperative federalism on the regulation of material that can harm and disturb. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country has, I believe, one of the best censorship systems in the world and I think it is regarded that way. It began in the early 1970s and very early on it was set up to balance what are perhaps two conflicting principles; that is, the rights of adults to see material they want to see and obviously the right of children to be protected. The conflict between these principles I believe overall has been resolved in a reasonably satisfactory way in regard to the public exhibition of material, particularly in cinemas, particularly with the application of the R classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have considerable concern about the way in which this material is in the video stores; the way in which that, in turn, has got into the hands of minors, and there is widespread evidence of that; the way it has affected the Aboriginal communities, particularly in the Northern Territory, in very unfortunate ways, and we have had evidence before the community standards committee of that; and the way in which paedophiles have used the material for seduction and the unfortunate effects of that on society. But we now have a national approach and we have seen evidence, particularly over the last two years, of a considerable amount of cooperation between state and federal Attorneys-General in the way in which this act or the whole area of censorship is to be administered in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have, as a committee on community standards, made a number of recommendations to the government on additional reforms apart from what is here at the moment. I think it is very unfortunate that the government has not taken up those particular reforms and the committee has once again urged that the reforms initially put forward in the computer games area a little over a year ago and now restated in our latest report on film classification be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I outline what those reforms are, I will just give an example of why such reform is needed. A few years ago a film called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS> came into this country. It is a horrific film. It has been banned in most countries; it was banned in Australia 17 years ago. But when it came before the OFLC it was initially, by majority decision, decided not to classify it as R, but the Film Review Board overturned that decision. I think this points to the nub of what is still the problem in the censorship area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have done is set up a system that is not really representative of what the community feels is needed in this area, and we have also taken out some degree of parliamentary scrutiny of the process. In the report of the community standards committee we did recommend that these two things again be put into the legislation initially and, as the government has not done that, we would urge the government to review that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first read this bill I was very disappointed to see that the current structure of censorship pretty much stayed the same. What the committee had recommended was that we have a chief censor and a deputy chief censor who are drawn from the community. The person who is currently the chief censor would become the chief executive officer and he would perform a role something like the head of other statutory authorities in terms of administering that particular area but that the actual final decisions as in a chief censor and a deputy chief censor be drawn from a board that is far more widely representative than the one we have currently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the record in a number of committee hearings I did ask about the representative nature of the present board. It is a great disappointment to me that public servants involved tried to hide the real situation on a number of occasions. We have a board that is highly unrepresentative. If you look at the occupations of the 10 people involved up until the latest change from 20, they include journalists, film critics, teachers, lecturers in media studies, public servants, school counsellors and a fitter. If you want someone perhaps representative of the community, the fitter was probably the closest you will get out of that group. Unfortunately, when the board was reformed and it was to go to 20 people&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Harradine interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just about to make that point&mdash;when the board was to be made up to 20 people the fitter went but there are still not 20 names. We went through the latest report and the board was only up to 11. Again, it was still the same sort of group. I am sure these people are very learned in these matters relating to film but the question is: do they really reflect community standards? When we asked the Attorneys-General offices and the OFLC questions on this from time to time, they claimed that these people, by their own community interaction, form a group that is reflecting community standards. I think that is drawing a pretty long bow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to do is set up a wider group, and the committee welcomes the fact that it has gone from 10 to 20. But again, the way in which these people are selected and the types of people who are selected need to be very carefully analysed. They are all very highly academically qualified, but if you had a truly representative cross-section of the community, you would not be using academic qualifications as your first and, I suspect in some ways, only criteria for selection. So we urge that that aspect of the board's work and structure certainly be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that we have recommended twice in committee reports&mdash;which is still being ignored&mdash;is that there should be a community group to review what happens with decisions of this reconstituted board. We recommended that any decisions of the board to do with classification at a particular level which were not unanimous be reviewed by this wider community group. The other part of this was that, when there is disagreement between the OFLC and the film review board, this wider community group review the decision of the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that will put in a mechanism which will solve a lot of the problems that we tend to have in this area. Suddenly, in an area that is fairly dynamic and rapidly changing, something happens&mdash;such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS> case&mdash;and the community gets outraged that this has happened. If these structures had been set up in the first place, those sorts of problems would not have happened. Part of the art of government is getting your structures right so you do not have to constantly set up committees and have inquiries and reviews. If you get the structure right in the first place, you stop that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that still disturbs us about this area is the lack of parliamentary scrutiny. It seemed very difficult to get information at times. A lot of the key information was tucked away in the back of reports; it does not come within the purview and scrutiny of the parliament. We have recommended, particularly when there are changes to the way in which we conduct the codes and review processes, that those changes actually lay on the table of both the state and federal parliaments, thus allowing parliamentarians to scrutinise the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most disturbing shortcoming of the system at the moment&mdash;and I really urge the OFLC to be more diligent in its approach to this&mdash;is the lack of consistency between state and federal procedures and, indeed, legislative bases. This was highlighted most dramatically recently by a case in Victoria. An adult chain called Club X was raided by the vice squad and a whole range of illegal videos were seized. The point of the story is that they got off scot-free on this because the Victorian Labor government in the 1980s had not kept up the definitions in the act to take into account newer technologies. The act talked about film. I note in the federal act that film is defined to include video, but this obviously was not the case in Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was he really? That perhaps explains some of it. What happened is that they got off scot-free. This is important because this company was completely flouting the censorship rules in this country. They had videos on the shelves that were seized by the police, and this is documented by the police and the story has been written up in the press. They had material that would have certainly been banned by the OFLC had it been classified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the tapes was of actual torture. A girl had been captured in California and she had been sexually tortured. This incident had been videotaped, and the videotape appeared in these adult shops in Melbourne. The title of the tape was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tortured Tits</EMPHASIS>, and this poor, unfortunate person not only had the terrible experience of going through such an ordeal but then had it displayed through these shops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the police seized the material, they discovered that most of the material was completely unclassified. The shop must have known that a raid was coming, and they rushed around and tried to put stickers on the tapes. They actually put the literature classification sticker&mdash;the class 1 and class 2 stickers&mdash;on videotapes, which, of course, does not apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The police seized thousands of tapes, along with invoices and documents. They took this material away, worked out their case to prosecute this group and went to court. A lawyer for the adult shops discovered a loophole in that the Victorian government had not changed the act to take into account the changes to the type of technology. Video is a series of electronic dots&mdash;it is not film technically&mdash;and it was not included in the definition. The judge threw out the case, restored all the films to these video shops and awarded them $200,000 in compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That shows that we can have a system that does not have proper scrutiny because the Public Service is not exercising due diligence to see that there is consistency between a state and federal act. It is not a big job. All you have to do is go to the front of the act and look at the definition. If you looked at the definition of the federal act and the definition of the state act, you would see that they did not line up. That is the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a federal system, but I urge the OFLC to be particularly diligent in administering this act by searching, in a pro-active way, to see if there are loopholes. What we do not want happening yet again, as that case showed, is someone who is trying to make a fast buck finding holes in the regulatory regime in this country. If that happens, we will just go on having Senate inquiry after Senate inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community standards committee that reported on this bill was set up four years ago, in 1991, to do one job, which was going to take about three months. What we discovered were these sorts of loopholes in the system that I mentioned. In particular, areas of the Public Service&mdash;particularly, in that case, Telecom&mdash;were not exercising due diligence. As time went on&mdash;and we were looking at fantasy phone calls at that stage&mdash;we discovered a whole range of other problems in the system. Four years later, it is coming up again and again. There are further problems in the system. The latest one we have heard of is that we could have shown on pay TV live tape from road accidents and police sieges, fed straight through into TV sets. Normally, all the film goes into a television studio. It is edited&mdash;obviously following certain guidelines, such as the FACTS code&mdash;and then a snippet which is not too offensive is shown that night. Under this scenario direct footage will be allowed to go straight through to the screens of pay TV viewers. We can imagine some of the horrific scenes, dealing with road accidents, police sieges and other disasters. Small children can see this if, as we discovered&mdash;particularly with the overseas experience&mdash;the decoding devices are not effective in preventing a proportion of children seeing this sort of material. So this is of great concern to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, bulletin boards are also a huge problem, and this is the next challenge for the committee. I am reminded very much of the advice of a very experienced staffer I had when four years ago I first got on this committee. She said, `You'll rue the day you got on this committee; its work will just go on and on and on.' Over the last four years that is precisely what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee could wind up and finish its work if we had in place in this country a proper regulatory regime for the area of censorship. I think the bill we are considering at the moment is a step in the right direction. But, again, I would urge public servants to be very diligent and pro-active in making sure that what they are suggesting in law is actually what happens in practice in this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill, which sets up a national classification code, is a timely reminder of the need for greater public scrutiny of what is considered suitable in the areas of publications, films and computer games which are now available in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, this government&mdash;in particular, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch)&mdash;gave carte blanche for the controversial film, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>, to be shown in Australia. I note that my colleague Senator Tierney a few moments ago also referred to the issue of this film. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 5 August 1994 I wrote to the federal Attorney-General, following the public outcry and distress about <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS> being shown in South Australia after it had received an R(18+) classification by the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board on 18 December 1992. Peter Duncan MP, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, replied by letter dated 22 September stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That decision was appealed to the Film and Literature Board of Review which, on 13 January 1993, upheld the appeal and directed the Censorship Board to register the film with a `For Restricted Exhibition' (R18) classification and the consumer advice `Disturbing Adult Concepts and High Level Violence and Sex'.</PARA>
<PARA>That was it. That was how concerned the federal Attorney-General was about the content of this film and the process used to give it an R classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July 1994 a constituent of mine in South Australia raised the issue of the disturbing content contained in the film, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>. What I understand to be an accurate description of degrading forms of behaviour and acts perpetrated in various scenes in this film which he detailed in his letter are too filthy and too abhorrent to repeat in this place. But there can be absolutely no doubt that such presentations should be banned completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this Labor government allowed this film to be shown in my home state of South Australia, Mr Richard Read, a Victorian crown prosecutor for 14 years who has prosecuted many violent sex criminals, had this to say about it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Salo is, without exception, the most horrific sexually violent film I have ever seen. Two of the people I was with when I saw it (at the request of the Herald-Sun newspaper) were police officers and both of them had to leave the room as they felt ill. It escapes me how Salo meets any of the statutory guidelines and I agree that we must await the copy-cat torture crimes of innocent children.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Richard Read said about a decision for which this government is responsible. Yet we have the Prime Minister strutting the stage saying that he wants a family television channel. What absolute hypocrisy from this government; what hypocrisy from this foul-mouthed Prime Minister!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should this legislation be passed, and I hope it will be, I will be among the first to call for this film, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>, to be banned in Australia under the government's new RC&mdash;refused classification&mdash;category. The government's proposed RC classification deals directly with publications which:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . describe, depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards or morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">described or depicted in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult, a minor who is, or who appears to be, under 16 (whether the minor is engaged in sexual activity or not); or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">promote, incite or instruct in matters of crime or violence&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a very accurate description of the film, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>. In South Australia we saw the former state Labor government&mdash;in this case, Attorney-General Chris Sumner&mdash;coming out publicly and actually defending this film, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>, on the pretext that it served a useful purpose in our community as a measure of protecting our civil liberties. What a joke! I struggle to fathom the former South Australian Labor Attorney-General's thinking in his defence of the film, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>, and in allowing it to be shown. I was very glad that the new Liberal Attorney-General, Trevor Griffin, overturned that decision when the film was attempted to be shown again later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will establish the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board. The government in its second reading speech has also indicated that the Law Reform Commission recommendation for community consultation will be adopted. Given the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS> controversy, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the existing board has become desensitised to the increasing levels of violence and pornography in our society. Consequently, this proposed community input is indeed welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments for regular reviews of the boards' membership and tenure are obvious. One must query the ability of any censorship board member to judge acceptable community standards, when desensitisation over time must be an inevitable consequence attached to this role. This was one of the recommendations of the Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies. Recommendation 11 of that committee stated that the length of tenure of censorship board members needed review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 51 of the bill, which sets out the terms and conditions of appointment to the Classification Board, provides that a member, other than a temporary member, may be appointed for up to five years and may be reappointed; a member's total period of appointment may not exceed seven years. Clause 76 of the bill similarly sets out the terms and conditions of appointment to the review board, also with a maximum term of seven years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, in presenting the government's response to the community standards committee recommendation 11, stated that the Law Reform Commission's recommendations regarding tenure have largely been adopted. The existing tenure periods are three years, with a further three years, and a maximum appointment period not exceeding six years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the tenure period has actually been increased with a term of five years, with a provision for reappointment and a maximum not exceeding seven years. This should be contrasted with evidence given to the committee during its public hearings where community groups requested a tenure period of two years. We have a situation where we currently have a maximum tenure period of six years, the community wants a tenure period of two years&mdash;and the government has extended it to seven, thereby increasing the capacity for members of this board to be desensitised and make false judgments about what ought and ought not to be available on television and other communications media. In that respect this bill does nothing to improve the situation; in fact, it worsens the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will have little effect in cleaning up the mess we are in if changes are not made on the censorship board which reflect a more appropriate degree of suitability of films, publications and computer games. If the government does not examine board membership and further review the tenure of board members, this bill will be nothing more than Clayton's legislation, paying lip service to the issue with little else on offer than the politically expedient portrayal of the Labor government's touted concern for families and protection of our children. That is the real concern about this legislation: that it is about creating a perception and an image and denying the reality that this government is doing nothing about the pornography, unacceptable films and other programs that are becoming more and more evident on television and other means of media communication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, the Prime Minister wants to give the impression that he is concerned about family standards and values; on the other hand, his government&mdash;the government for which he as Prime Minister must take primary responsibility&mdash;appoints people to the Office of Film and Literature Classification Board who refuse to stand up and be counted when it comes to maintaining decency. The Attorney-General and the government should move to ban the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>. It recently refused to do this despite public condemnation. Only if it does this will it prove its commitment to the stated aims of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point which I want to make concerns the amendment to this bill which excludes from the definition of `computer game' material on computer bulletin boards. The omission of paragraph (a) and thus the exclusion, it is stated, will enable the classification board to classify computer games on computer bulletin boards if there is some requirement to do so under other Commonwealth, state or territory legislation. Attorney-General Lavarch, in reply to a question on 12 October 1994, said that part of the reason for this exclusion was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government clearly&mdash;and no doubt the Opposition&mdash;is not interested in having any laws which would unreasonably intrude upon the privacy of the telephone system.</PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General went on to say that, because of both cost and intrusion upon the sanctity of the telephone system, he considered unrealistic the recommendation of the task force that a censorship regime be applied to bulletin board traffic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further argument which has been used for this exclusion is that the percentage of the Australian population who access the international computer network via a modem is currently only four per cent. In most instances, this low percentage would be relevant. However, in Australia, there are currently some 500,000 Internet users, and the Internet is the fastest growing telecommunications network globally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journal of Economic Perspectives</EMPHASIS>, volume 8, No. 3 published statistics as at March 1994 showing that the Internet, the largest network with an estimated 15 million users, has had a 600-fold increase in only six years. The traffic of the network is currently increasing at a rate of six per cent per month. This growth is quite extraordinary. The Attorney-General has recognised that Australia is the second greatest user in the world of this technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The danger for our children, many of whom are much more computer literate than their parents, is simply that by using a personal computer connected to the Internet they can gain access to specific pornographic bulletin board services such as Kinknet and Throbnet, often without the knowledge or permission of their parents. Pirated software and sexually  explicit material, including interactive adult games and entire libraries of X-rated pictures, apparently can be found on some bulletin boards. It is not beyond the realm of possibility for children to unlock and gain access to this material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authors of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Internet Complete Reference</EMPHASIS>, published by McGraw-Hill in 1994, rank the most popular Usenet discussion groups on data which includes the number of messages posted to particular groups. According to the authors of this reference, the fourth most popular discussion group is called Alt.Sex, which covers a wide range of sexual topics and interests. Five of the 10 most popular groups, that is 50 per cent, are described as sexually explicit. Computer technology advances do make it difficult to prevent minors from gaining access to pornographic material. This is even more relevant with the tightening of legislation in this area. Bulletin boards are the one remaining conduit for marketing pornographic information. This loophole is a fact which cannot be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An article which appeared in the 8 October 1994 issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS> magazine entitled `Network Confidential' explains that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . virtually uncrackable `public key' encryption has made available, to one and all, a method of cryptography programs such as PGP (the name is short for pretty good privacy).</PARA>
<PARA>The article also explains the two-key system required to encode and decode messages by means of a private and public key. However, the trail of the two-key system and newest methods of encryption do draw attention to the material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A more sinister and insidious method of cryptography, when examined in the context of the transmission of pornography, is the ability to compress and incorporate in digitised pictures material which can then be unlocked by code. This material is not obvious or detectable to the user who is not looking for it or does not know what to look for. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS> article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hiding messages in seemingly innocent pictures or texts is an old technique. But in the era of computers, it has become cheap, easy and undetectable.</PARA>
<PARA>This technology therefore is a powerful tool for those who know how to manipulate and control it. The Dutch government in early 1994 attempted to ban coded messages outright, but withdrew that proposal in July 1994. France now requires that all cryptography be licensed, that the licensee has a legitimate reason for using it and that the government be given a copy of the private key. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States decided that cryptography is acceptable provided that it held the keys to a trapdoor in every system and sponsored a computer chip called `clipper' as an industry standard. Industry experts tried and failed to crack the clipper and it had been declared safe. However, recently it took a cryptography expert only 28 minutes on a common workstation to render the trapdoor unusable. The dual issues of privacy and censorship are not easily reconciled, but I urge the government not to rest on its laurels in relation to computer bulletin boards classification. This issue has been and is being addressed by other governments. Given the Attorney-General's acknowledgment that Australia is the second largest user of the Internet, perhaps the time has come for a more detailed consideration of this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply conclude by saying that I hope this legislation will have some beneficial effect on restricting the expansion of opportunities for pornography to be viewed through our various media. If the government really wants to convince the community that it is fair dinkum in its approach to families and children on this issue and it is not, as I said earlier, merely trying to create the perception that it cares about families, and is thereby trying to match the undoubted and recognised commitment of the Liberal and National parties to family values and family standards, then it needs to go further than is provided in this legislation&mdash;much, much further. In particular, in a practical way in terms of decisions that have to be made immediately, that film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo </EMPHASIS>needs to be banned. More importantly, the government needs to deal with this issue of bulletin boards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will refer briefly to some matters that have not really been included in the legislation, and one that has, because I believe that this is the appropriate time to raise these issues. This bill seeks to implement recommendations from a 1991 report of the Law Reform Commission on the feasibility of establishing a national scheme covering films and publication classifications, and it recommends that there should be a rationalisation of state laws to create a national scheme. The Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies has also looked into the matter, urging in 1993 that computer games and videos be brought under the national censorship system. Some of those committee recommendations have been dealt with and others have not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to raise four particular points at this point. The first one is not dealt with in this present legislation but it relates to the matter under our consideration at this time, and that is the repeated suggestions that the non-violent erotica classification should replace the X classification. The X classification has led to a misconception in the community that such films contain extremes of violence and sexual violence and illegal sexual behaviour, like child pornography. At the same time the X category currently allows material with certain activities which may be inconsistent with community standards, such as aggressive behaviour, demeaning sexual dialogue or sadomasochism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to my colleagues in the chamber that the Australian Institute of Criminology, in its paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Institute of Criminology: Trends and Issues Paper No. 9</EMPHASIS> of 1987, showed a sampling of what was contained in PG, M, R, X and refused-classification videos and presented to us&mdash;I have discovered this to my surprise&mdash;the fact that X-rated videos contain less violence than any other category of film or video that it looked at. In fact, M-rated videos contain the most violence. R-rated videos contain the most sexual violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Harradine interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine has quite helpfully pointed out that it is not simply violence or sexual violence that we are concerned about but demeaning behaviour. I think that this is one of the strongest arguments for replacing the X classification with a classification which specifies that there is to be no non-violent erotica and removes those demeaning components&mdash;demeaning sexual dialogue, sadomasochism or aggressive behaviour. My view regarding this is that it is indisputable that there is a very popular perception within the community that non-violent erotica should be available to adults&mdash;not children but adults.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also cite the Australian Broadcasting Authority. It announced that in some polling there was strong support&mdash;70 per cent&mdash;for X classified material containing scenes of actual sex between consenting adults being made available to adults, with video being the preferred medium. Whether or not that is a situation which I might agree or disagree with, I do not think any of us can fail to note that the popularity of such material and its current availability under the X classification mean that unduly demeaning and violent material is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, a black market has arisen where material is available that would have been refused if it had been submitted for classification under the non-violent erotica category. I believe the police and enforcement agencies need to concentrate on the more extreme material and work together to promote a freedom from those kinds of rackets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the anomaly that, because the ACT and the Northern Territory have X-rated videos available in restricted areas only, mail order black market rackets can occur. I ask for greater consideration of the issue that it may be better to relabel or reclassify material as non-violent erotica with some modification to the guidelines and also of the issue of improving the age of participants to be 18 or over. This would allow us to have, I believe, a more realistic adjustment to both the demands for this material in the community and a control over what is made available or floating around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The classification of material should reflect community standards. It is clear that the majority of people would like to see non-violent erotica available to adults even though they may not wish to obtain it themselves. What should be of greater concern is the level of extreme violence in films, videos and computer games as well as the sexual content of computer games. Computer games in particular&mdash;which are interactive, intensive and repetitive&mdash;have the potential to adversely influence the minds of young people and should come under increasing scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I wish to raise is that, if we were to have non-violent erotica classification for films, that classification and the R classification should carry health education messages that allow people not only to learn from the materials that they are seeing and to counteract both the violence and the demeaning behaviour contained in films but also to promote a healthier approach to sexual material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I raise is that classification costs at the moment are inequitable. The current position is that the fee for classification is based on the duration of films alone. That is inequitable because it has no regard to the nature of films and the extent of their distribution, nor the cost or the likely profits to be earned. So what we may have is an art film with very limited distribution having the same fee requirement as a blockbuster film which has wider screening and generates large profits. The fee structure for classification of films should, I believe, reflect the diversity of films and their different types of audiences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to comment on an aspect of this bill which I believe is very important, and that is providing for the independence of board members. I believe that it can be stated that in more recent times board members have become engaged in policy making and advisory roles to the minister. This has the potential to erode the independence of board members in their primary role of classification. It raises the possibility of political pressure being applied on future classification decisions. That is an undesirable state of affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly support the fact that the director should be the only person taking on a Public Service role, as recommended by the Senate committee. The limited tenure of such a position is also valuable because it allows a rotation of office and also a capacity to be more responsive to community needs and views. In conclusion, I understand this bill has the support of the Senate. I put on record these matters, which may receive consideration at a later date. </PARA>

<PARA>This annual report is an interesting report, because the work of the IMF is one of the things that are surrounded by mystery for most people. I must admit that, on reading the report of the Treasurer (Mr Willis), one is not necessarily that much enlightened on the operations of the IMF at the end of the perusal of the document. It is interesting, though, to note some of the things that the IMF has been doing. In particular it has been providing advice to a number of countries to deal with problems of adjustment, principally problems to do with growth, although there are some countries that have had more difficult problems than that. For example, the IMF has provided assistance in terms of advising Germany on how to handle recovery and advising the Chinese government in relation to issues of growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IMF also assists countries in transition. I would like to make some comments about the situation in Vietnam and Cambodia. I suppose I should preface those remarks by making the comment that it is easy for the IMF to give advice; the difficult thing is to persuade the people of a country to necessarily follow the advice. One of the observations I made at the end of the 1980s dealing with Latin America was that there were remedies for the Latin American crisis, but the question was whether people were going to accept those remedies. Countries that are in transition, such as Vietnam, require a certain degree of political courage, inasmuch as governments have to make decisions which are politically difficult. It then follows that you also need a certain degree of courage and willingness to cooperate from the community at large. That is just as difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Countries such as Vietnam are coming to realise that the years of communist rule were wasted years in terms of economic advancement and that communist countries across the world, it does not matter where they are, have been shown at the end of the Cold War to be economically backward. In comparing them with other countries that were in a similar stage of development at the beginning of the Cold War, it is shown very clearly that communism has failed. The socialist experiment was a failure; yet these governments often require some degree of encouragement to accept that and to accept that it is time to embark on a more liberal economic course than the one which has been in use in these countries for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, the difficulty, and it is a difficulty which is being experienced and observed in Eastern Europe as much as anywhere else, is that the people who have for so long lived in an economic system which was a fiction&mdash;nobody can say otherwise that the economic system in Eastern Europe was a fiction&mdash;have a lot of difficulty adjusting to economic reality because, in many cases, economic reality brings substantial pain. The longer a country has been a communist country, the harder it is for it to break out of the economic fiction. That is why we find in some eastern European countries a resurgence of people saying, `We should have a communist government.' Those people are dreaming of a time which can never come back and which never really existed in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, the willingness of people to change quickly is the key determinant. If people are wanting to compromise change in these countries, then the process of change becomes much slower and it entails much more pain. I hope that we will see substantial change in countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia. Cambodia, of course, also has political problems. There are other countries in the region which have been subject to governments of less than satisfactory economic persuasion. We hope, too, that changes will occur there, just as we hope changes in human rights will occur. When we talk about human rights, one of the biggest factors in deciding whether a country enjoys full and proper human rights is the level of its economic self-sufficiency and the standard of living enjoyed by the people. Obviously, when they have a higher standard of living, they put more of a price and value on human life. That is something we should all look forward to. </PARA>

It is that time of the year again. This report is actually a great improvement, in our opinion, on previous ones, which have been far more general and descriptive. This one at least gives some taste of topical issues. Has anything changed? It appears from this report and general information on International Monetary Fund statements that it has not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the IMF presented as a major tool in helping countries develop, yet Australia's representation to the IMF is still under control of the Treasurer, who may be interested in seeing increased economic activity but is singularly uninterested in equity, sustainability or most legitimate goals of the wider community both in Australia and globally. As such, I guess we show ourselves as being quite different in our opinion of the benefits of taking IMF advice from what was given just then by Senator O'Chee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a high point, last November, at the 50-year anniversary of the World Bank, formed at the same time as the IMF, Michel Cadessus, managing director of the IMF, heavily criticised national minimum wage and condition regulation, unemployment support programs and restrictions on lay-offs and the dismissal of workers. The elimination of these things are liable to be included among the social policies the IMF uses its power to impose, along with a reduction of social infrastructure. The World Bank also seeks to impose such structural adjustment as a condition for its assistance. It was also revealed in Madrid that the World Bank receives more money from developing nations than it gives&mdash;so much for developing nations needing the World Bank to improve their position. These are good reasons to question the role and continued existence of these institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to Australia's role in the IMF, the Treasurer, Mr Willis, said at the same meeting that no measures should be taken to integrate environmental or labour standards into trade. The IMF not only tends to be a fundamental economic decision maker on the global stage but also has the ability&mdash;and uses it&mdash;to erode national measures in countries that borrow, imposing draconian `structural adjustment' policies on subject nations. Just think about it: when the economies are good, it says, `Cut government spending,' and when the economies are bad, it says&mdash;surprise, surprise!&mdash;`Cut government spending.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IMF and, indeed, other institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank where the Treasurer is our representative have been heavily criticised by the non-government international development community for these programs. Most recently there has been a strong campaign to end these institutions as counterproductive to genuine, equitable and sustainable development. When the purpose of Australian support for these institutions has been questioned, Australian representatives, especially from development and aid divisions within Foreign Affairs, often answer that they should not be ended, that `we' need to work within and to make them more green and more just. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears, however, that the Treasurer and, through Treasury, the Australian people are working in exactly the opposite direction. We are working to ensure that nations have austerity programs imposed on them, to ensure that social services, basic health and education services, provision of clean water and so on are cut in order to pay for debt often imposed to pay for poorly conceived and heavily prescribed development programs advocated by these same agencies. At the same time, it is demanded that they open their economy to foreign investors anxious to exploit rather than to build and to foreign imports such as cars and alcohol which do nothing to increase productivity, and that they lift capital flow controls and so assist capital flight. This is structural adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note on page 27 of the report in the section on the enhanced structural adjustment facility that there has been increasing recognition of `the importance of addressing social issues'. This is whitewash. As the statement of the managing director to whom I referred earlier indicates, the IMF is not interested in social safety nets. It is a smokescreen to deflect critics of the IMF. While the moves towards increased social responsibility are to be applauded, they are likely to be too little too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IMF was created to regulate currency exchange. It was created after World War II to avoid the disastrous speculation that followed World War I. Its effective role ended with the floating of most currencies in the period around 1980. The IMF has not achieved the purpose it was designed for. It is not doing wonderful things to assist development in those nations which need it most. Whilst it is possible that the IMF might have done an Ebenezer Scrooge type transformation if the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future visited it since the Madrid meeting, I believe it is time to consider whether the IMF still has a role to play in today's world. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This report from NBEET and its Australian Research Council monitors the progress of the Institute of Advanced Studies at the Australian National University and checks that targets are met for collaborative activities with other universities. The Australian National University, in particular its Institute of Advanced Studies, is one of the great institutions of this country. It is a research body which attracts world-class scholars and which produces world-class results. It has in its ranks a number of Nobel Prize winners and Nobel Prize nominees. It is an institution which was started in the 1950s. It is one of the great achievements of the Menzies era. The institution developed initially under the guidance of Howard Florey. Since that time it has developed a wide range of research schools which are constituent to the Institute of Advanced Studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a number of years reviews of that school have been undertaken. In 1990 the Stephens review discovered that the institute had fallen off the pace somewhat on one of its key roles, which was to act as a breeding ground for researchers and people who would move into research in other universities. The Stephens review also found that the institute had fallen off the pace with respect to collaborative research projects. The review had established a number of guidelines and targets with respect to collaborative research for the institute to meet. This report shows that the institute is on target to meet the percentage of the budget allocated to collaborative research projects by the Stephens committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will recall that the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training did carry out an investigation into the Stephens committee report. We did find the report wanting in many ways. It was particularly unfortunate that the Stephens review found that the government had attempted to carve up the Institute of Advanced Studies. There was an attempt back in 1991 that partially succeeded in moving the John Curtin School of Medical Research out of the Institute of Advanced Studies. In the end, the finance of the school was moved from the DEET budget to the health budget. Our committee, after conducting an extensive hearing, found that that should not have happened. It should have stayed as part of the Institute of Advanced Studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great strengths of the institute is that it has a number of constituent schools which interact with each other. For example, people in the biological sciences school interact very much with the people in the medical school. The administration of the school's funding is hampered by having two government departments involved. It is something which we hope the government will revisit some time. The last time I checked, the university was not very happy with this arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time we thought it was part of a plan by the government to dismantle the institute. Some people thought that the time for this sort of institution had passed. Under the Dawkins grand, unified national system, the idea was to create universities that looked as alike as possible. The Institute of Advanced Studies sat oddly in that scheme of things. It was an institution that was totally devoted to research; it was totally devoted to excellence. It was not in the pattern of the other universities. We all suspected that Mr Dawkins really did not want it there. But it has survived, and indeed thrived, following the Dawkins years. This report is testimony to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to raise one small criticism about the distribution of collaborative research monies. It is still focussing very much on four of the big seven universities. Over 40 per cent of the funds go to those universities. The money really needs to be distributed across a wider range of universities. The collaborative work and the excellence that come out of that need to be distributed. That will be of great benefit to a wide range of universities. I commend the report to the Senate and wish the Institute of Advanced Studies well in its pursuit of excellence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to refer to a letter that I have received from a company called Sea Air Travel Pty Ltd of 403 Grange Road, Seaton, South Australia. It is a letter from a Mr Francesco Tigani complaining that I have acted disgracefully by libelling this person in relation to some matters relating to prosecutions and a relationship with Mr Francesco Labozzetta. That is not Mr Antonio Labozzetta, who is involved in Australian soccer; it is Mr Francesco Labozzetta, who I understand is his cousin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I raise this issue is that I am intrigued when people like this write letters to members of parliament,  sending copies to one's leader, which are simply full of total, dishonest nonsense. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RE: Comments made in the Senate 7th December 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I and my wife, Maria Tigani, are the directors of Sea Air Travel Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sea Air Travel has been an established travel agency business in Adelaide for over 27 years since 1968. During that period the business has been conducted under various entitles, initially as a partnership of my wife and I, then as business name for F Tigani and Co Pty. Ltd. and since 1986 as a business name for the Company Sea Air Travel Pty. Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of these entitles have only involved my wife and I as principals and no other person. My wife and I have been the only directors and shareholders of both F. Tigani &amp; Co. Pty. Ltd. and Sea Air Travel Pty. Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your speech in the senate made certain derogatory remarks of a Mr Francesco Nocola Labozzetta. You went then on to make assert that Mr Labozzetta was an owner, for a period of three years of Sea Air Travel business in South Australia. You have been horribly misinformed as Mr Labozzetta has never been involved with Sea Air Travel in South Australia. To the best of my knowledge, Mr Labozzetta has never been involved in any travel business in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the same speech you then went on to say that the family involved in running Sea Air Travel in South Australia was involved in drug dealings. Again you have been badly misinformed. The NCA investigation that you refer to involved a number of families.</PARA>
<PARA>Families in at one least sense or another; I am not quite certain which sense Mr Tigani has in mind. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In court proceedings (not involving criminal charges for drugs) an assertion was made that one of the families was involved in drugs. However firstly this did not refer to my family. Secondly the family involved has no involvement whatsoever in the Sea Air Travel business. Thirdly the asserties made was never proved and not repeated in those proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>He then calls on me to publicly withdraw. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intriguing that someone would assert that these entities only have been involved&mdash;Mr Tigani and his wife as principals and no-one else&mdash;and that Mr Francesco Labozzetta has never been involved in Sea Air Travel. I have here under the business names act an application for registration of the business name of Sea Air Travel Service of 403 Grange Road. The applicants as shown on this form, which is dated 22 May 1969, are Francesco Tigani, who has written me this charming letter, and Francesco Nocola Labozzetta, who, according to Mr Tigani, does not exist in South Australia, has never existed and has never been in partnership with Mr Francesco Tigani. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I presume that this is the same Francesco Tigani who wrote the letter. Obviously, he has had some incredible memory lapse. Not only that, we have a statement regarding a change of persons in relation to whom the business name is registered. The business involved is Sea Air Travel Service of 403 Grange Road. On 5 June 1972, certain persons ceased to carry on business under that business name. As I have properly said, Francesco Nocola Labozzetta then ceased. Unless my mathematics are appalling, 1969 to 1972 is three years. I asserted that Mr Francesco Labozzetta had been involved in this business for three years. Perhaps Mr Tigani cannot count as well as having a bad memory. It is extraordinary that people write this kind of nonsense when the facts are self-evident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is also extraordinary to me is that Mr Antonio Labozzetta, in some newspaper articles and on a television appearance, claimed how he wrote to the President, as I recall it, denying that he had any association or involvement with Sea Air Travel in South Australia. He said that, once again, that terrible fellow Baume was disgraceful in suggesting that he would be involved with this business, the Tigani family or whoever is involved in the NCA report&mdash;I commend it to Mr Tigani if he has forgotten about it&mdash;for 1990-91. As you are well aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that report deals with the remarkable story of these families and the extent to which the various members of them were prosecuted. Some people say that the penalty did not fit the crime; others do not. They were prosecuted in respect of various tax matters relating to the remarkable way that they appeared to earn money which did not appear to relate to their stated businesses. I think that is a polite way of dealing with the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It interests me that Antonio Labozzetta claimed I was talking absolute nonsense by saying that there was any link with Sea Air Travel. How dare I suggest that any member of his family was involved. I have copies of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">La Fiamma </EMPHASIS>newspaper. I picked them at random, because this advertisement appeared for many months. I have here&mdash;I will table them&mdash;copies of advertisements that appeared on 18 August 1994 and 25 August 1994. They state this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fratelli Labozzetta trading as Marconi Travel&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is the company I referred to earlier this week when I dealt with the annual report of the Australian Soccer Federation. In that instance, I told the chamber that the annual report of the Soccer Federation revealed that something like $240,000 in travel business had gone to this company in the normal course of business by the Australian Soccer Federation while Mr Tony Labozzetta was a commissioner or director of the Australian Soccer Federation. I said that I thought that was not a terribly wise thing to do, irrespective of whether it was in the normal course of business, because there is the clear potential for a conflict of interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this advertisement, there is a special tour. One has to get in while one can; it costs only $5,490. It says that those who want to deal with this matter who are in South Australia should contact Sea Air Travel. The phone number for those interested in dealing with the Tigani family is (08) 356 3266. It strikes me as extraordinary that there is no link whatsoever and that gratuitously the Labozzetta brothers would promote in their own advertisements this company with which they have no associations and with which they have never been involved. I suppose one could say that at least they are not promoting another travel company owned by Francesco Nocola Labozzetta, which also exists in Sydney. I am just intrigued that the travel agency business is such an interesting one for such an interesting group of people to be so heavily involved in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want by way of advice to suggest to Mr Tigani that, if he wants to blackguard me by writing to my leader, it would be a good idea if he got his facts right. I stress his comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I feel that in the circumstances you should publicly withdraw your comments in so far as they effect Sea Air Travel in South Australia and/or my families.</PARA>
<PARA>I assure him that I will not withdraw those comments. Furthermore, I express my distress that when inquiries were made of the South Australian Soccer Federation about how one should book to go to the World Cup in America it referred people to Sea Air Travel. I wonder why the South Australian Soccer Federation would have any such links with this organisation in view of the background, which can be demonstrated by looking at the NCA reports, of its principals and their capacity to write such nonsensical letters which are simply false in every material fact. I seek leave to table the advertisements and the letter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the adjournment tonight in relation to John Hewson's resignation from parliament last Monday. I was somewhat stunned to read Alan Ramsay's column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald </EMPHASIS>today in which he pointed out, somewhat regrettably, that my colleagues Senator Baume and Senator Watson were the only two speakers outside the leadership group to comment upon John's resignation. I guess my lame excuse is that I was on sick leave on Monday night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity tonight to pay tribute to John Hewson's service to his party, this parliament and the people of Australia. As the Labor Party would acknowledge, it is an enormous achievement to lead one of the two major parties of this country at federal level. It is an achievement to lead what is, in my view, the greatest and most successful party of Australia&mdash;the Liberal Party of Australia. John did that for the third longest period after Menzies and Fraser; he led it for over four years. That achievement will always stand John Hewson in good stead and will always be remembered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party exhibited an extraordinary degree of unity and sense of purpose under the first three years of John Hewson's leadership. Everybody in the party acknowledges that after the 1980s, when the party had some difficulties, there is much to be said for the incredible esprit de corps, sense of purpose and unity that existed between 1990 and 1993 under John's very strong, dedicated and disciplined leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some personal relations with John in the sense that I was flattered and honoured to be invited by John to be his chief of staff when he first became leader in March of 1990. It is a phone call I will long remember&mdash;the difficulty I had in saying that I had at that point decided to stay in South Australia and seek Liberal preselection for the Senate, and was therefore not in a position to accept what I regarded as the great honour it would have been to be his chief of staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my quieter moments I often reflect on what might have been had I accepted that position. With all due modesty I am not sure that I could have done anything about what eventually happened in 1993, but it is odd to reflect on what might have happened if I had taken that job. I decided to stay in South Australia, seek Liberal preselection and run the federal campaign in South Australia for the 1993 election. I did that with great pleasure, working very closely and campaigning with John. The result in South Australia did prove that Fightback was saleable. It is said now that it was a totally unsaleable document, yet we had the best result in South Australia federally for 20 years. </PARA>

There is absolutely no doubt that Australia would be in much better shape if he had won that election and if he were now Prime Minister. Every Australian would be much better off. It is ironic that today we have had another reminder of that with another disastrous set of balance of payments figures.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I personally regret that John and I had something of a falling out after the 1993 election. I formed the honest and objective view that it was in John's best interests to resign the leadership of the party&mdash;to stay in parliament but to resign from the leadership because he had won the position and achieved his position in politics as the champion of a set of beliefs. I honestly thought he should resign the leadership to continue championing those beliefs, and he could not do that as leader of a party that had just lost an election under his leadership. So I thought it was in his best interests to resign from the leadership. He happened not to agree with that and as a result was not all that pleased with me. </PARA>

<PARA>There are probably many others who agree with that, and no doubt Senator Schacht thinks that. In the circumstances I understand why John reached that view about me but I still hold to the view that it was in John's interests to have resigned and not stayed in the leadership after 1993. I think he would have gone out, in a sense, more of a hero. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding I want to congratulate John honestly and sincerely and as much as I can on his achievements in politics. He achieved much more than most of us ever will in politics in a very short time. He did make an enormous contribution to the party. He did wake Australia up to the kinds of economic reforms that are needed in this country. While Labor remains in office for at most another 12 months I hope it will pursue an economic reform agenda. Most of Fightback will ultimately be implemented in Australia one way or another and in time. I particularly want to congratulate John on the quality and dignity of his resignation speech. It was a great speech and one that will long be remembered. I honestly believe it is a tragedy that he is not currently Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letter was signed Brian Lander, officer-in-charge. I put it on the record that when Australian Red Cross found out I was going to Galang in January they had in their possession a watch and some other property of a boat person who came to Australia and who was later sent back to Galang. They asked me to return that property to him if I possibly could. I did endeavour to do that but I was overjoyed to find that when I arrived at Galang the particular individual concerned had, for himself, made a decision to start rebuilding his life and had offered himself for voluntary repatriation to his homeland, Vietnam. He had departed from Galang island in Indonesia by the time I arrived there. I am very pleased to put on the public record the efforts the Australian Red Cross has made to get this property back to the individual concerned. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have just got your address from my Christian congregations. They told me that you are very concerned about the boat people at Galang. I appreciate your benevolence in providing letters of sponsorship for them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hereby I would like to inform you that letters of sponsorship is helpful to those who are refugee. They are eligible to be resettled to the third countries.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But to those who are not refugees letters of sponsorship is meaningless. They must be repatriated to their home land (Cambodia or Vietnam). By giving them papers of sponsorship means that you give hope and expectation to be resettled. They have been wasting their time awaiting for nothing. This reality is badly contrary to the plan/policy of UNHCR and the Indonesian government. It is a serious obstacle to repatriation programme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a pastor and shepherd of boat people at Galang, I have to share you my more moral responsibility for the sake of their future.

<PARA>It is not my grammar because it is a direct quote from the letter. I read that letter into the record because I was greatly distressed when that letter was brought to my attention when I was in Galang. The unfortunate circumstance on that island at the moment is that all the people who are held there have been screened out as refugees. They are not eligible to take up the offer of sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that there are people in Australia who are giving false hope to those people who remain on the island. This has caused a lot of distress on the island. The people there see that they have yet another chance to resettle in a third country, but, of course, that opportunity is not there. Australia is not able to help. Australia has done an enormous job in resettling boat people from many parts of the south-east Asian region. Those people are leading very productive lives in this country. Unfortunately, many of their colleagues continue to vegetate in refugee camps in South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns me that organisations, such as the one that  this letter was addressed to, ought to know better. They should not be giving hope to those people when that will not be fulfilled in the end. It reflects badly on organisations if they go ahead and give false hope to people who feel that they are in dire circumstances. I urge that no more letters of sponsorship be sent to Galang island because no-one else can be repatriated to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Minchin's remarks about the resignation of Dr Hewson reminded me of something. I also noted the article today written by Alan Ramsay. In the circumstances, some acknowledgment should be given to the resignation of John Hewson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Hewson and I have a connection. He married his second wife and I married my wife in the same church&mdash;the Gartrell Memorial Church in Adelaide. I married in that church in 1970. The reason I married in the Gartrell Methodist Church, as it then was, was that my best man's name was Gartrell. It seemed as good a church as any to be married in. I understand Carolyn chose the church because it was the local church where she grew up. That is the only social connection we have other than both he and I were elected at the 1987 election. The only other thing that I can think of that we have in common is that for a short period when he was shadow minister for customs&mdash;in May, June and July of last year, before he was dismissed from the frontbench&mdash;I attempted to speak to him on a couple of occasions about customs issues and was not able to make the connection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is appropriate that a couple of remarks be made about John Hewson's career. From our side of politics, we believe that he made a classic political mistake, and economic mistake in the circumstances, by proposing the GST which was the fundamental part of Fightback. I also think John Hewson's other mistake was that he concentrated overwhelmingly on one issue, an economic issue. I suspect that if, at the time he was leader, he had accepted the challenge of the Prime Minister in 1992 in relation to such issues as the republic and the Australian national identity, proposed those sorts of changes and engaged in a positive way in that debate, the election result in 1993 may have been much closer and he would have had a much greater chance of success. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You lost by 15 seats which is a pretty big loss. I understand that John Hewson had a very open mind and was quite positive on social issues and issues of national identity. I think he made a mistake in trying to buy too much acquiescence or quietness within the Liberal Party by allowing the John Howards and the Bronwyn Bishops of this parliament to run amuck on constitutional issues and claim their support for the monarchy in an extremely negative and backward way. I think John Howard will have great difficulty in the next election, which will be in the next 12 months or so, trying to claim himself as a man of the future when he only harks back to policies of the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Though I believe John Hewson's economic policies were misguided, I do think it has to be acknowledged that he was willing to put forward a detailed economic prescription for Australia. He took his ideas into the marketplace of politics and was willing to fight them out. I believe he ought to be given due credit for that. Time will only tell what people think. Historians will speculate what may have happened if he had won the election. I think his troubles would have only just begun if he had won the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think he lacked the political skill, although he had an economic prescription, to get such a massive economic program through this parliament and accepted in the Australian community. That would have been really testing for any politician in Australia's history, even those with the greatest of political skills, but it certainly tested John Hewson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the fact that John Hewson chose to announce his resignation formally in the parliament. I think Alan Ramsay is right in what he said. He made the speech in parliament and he did not, as he was fully entitled to do and was able to do, send a letter of resignation to the Speaker and never be heard of again in the forum of the parliament. I think that is a lesson for all of us. If we get the opportunity&mdash;and some of us may not because we may be defeated at an election and not have that choice&mdash;to make a resignation or parting speech in the parliament, I think we ought to take it. I think John Hewson should be congratulated for using that opportunity, even though there were probably plenty of people, particularly on his side, who wished he had not. As Alan Ramsay pointed out, it is significant that so few on his own side spoke. I think that is disappointing for John Hewson and disappointing for the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Alan Ramsey pointed out that, by resigning when he did, John Hewson is not entitled to a permanent pension, a gold pass and all the other emoluments available to those who serve at least nine years in parliament. If he had gone to the next election and then was defeated or if he had been defeated in the preselection in two months time, he would have been eligible for a pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to point out, of course, that many of us do not have the luxury of John Hewson's personal wealth, which means that this might not have been a consideration. There are many of us in this place who do not have access to personal wealth of such size, and a pension is a consideration after we leave parliament. But, just the same, he could have easily sat it out for another 12 months and collected the pension. I think that ought to be acknowledged. I think that says something about the character of Hewson doing it his way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed a long time ago in my younger days, when John Gorton was defeated for the leadership of the Liberal Party, that the ABC program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">This Day Tonight</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the precursor to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>&mdash;at the end had a montage of scenes of John Gorton's political career overlaid with Frank Sinatra singing <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I did it my way</EMPHASIS>. Despite the fact that he will be remembered as not being a good politician and for losing an election everyone said he should have won, I suspect that in some ways John Hewson would be quite happy to say, `I did it my way in the Liberal Party'. I think that is rather a glib reference and a very glib analysis of what really was going on in that election campaign. The issues were wider than just saying that he should have won what was considered an unlosable election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that, above all else, we ought to acknowledge the fact that John Hewson had the courage, however he did it, to convince the Liberal Party to put up a major economic package with all its flaws. He did it; he went out in the marketplace; he lost. I think the last two years in this place were pretty uncomfortable for him. It is acknowledged that, once you lose an election like that, you are on a treadmill that is going backwards in a sense. He lost the leadership and then he lost his frontbench position. Some of those instances showed that he did lack political skill, but you cannot deny the fact that he had his own sense, his own way and his own quota of courage to put the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to acknowledge that&mdash;even though I have never said more than about three words to John Hewson. The only time he ever mentioned me, he deliberately mispronounced my name of Schacht into another variation that has more to do with lavatory humour. I thought that actually did him more damage than it did me, and it again showed a lack of political skill and judgment. But it was of no consequence to me. Anyway, I finally wish him and Carolyn success with the forthcoming family and wish him well in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply rise to express my disappointment at the tone of Alan Ramsey's article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. Because you do not jump to your feet in this place and pay tribute to a past leader or past colleague, it does not mean that you do not have the right feelings towards him or her or that you have not been happy with his or her leadership. I use this example: do you have to tell your wife and children every day that you love them? If you do not do it that day, does that mean you have stopped loving them?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say that I was proud to be part of his team leading up to the 1993 election. I was very happy to sell our policy. In Western Australia, as you know yourself, Mr President, the coalition did extremely well. We polled a record, I believe, 54 per cent of the two-party preferred vote. We took two seats from the government and were within an ace of taking another seat, the prized seat of Swan held by Mr Beazley&mdash;the difference was something under 200 votes. There was a very similar situation with Mr Gear in Canning, and we reduced the majority in Brand to 2.8 per cent. So I believe that we sold the policy in Western Australia. They accepted the policy, and we certainly did well. </PARA>
