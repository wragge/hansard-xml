<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I remind the minister that on Sunday Mr Keating said he had received the message sent by Canberrans during the weekend by-election, yet the very next day he belittled middle Australia by referring to the fact that they are concentrating on the `grindstone' of their mortgages when they should be, like him, concentrating on the big issues of the republic, Mabo and Aboriginal rights, and apparently our identity. I ask: does the minister understand that a fear of rising mortgage rates is a grindstone of middle class Australians? Is he prepared to express some sympathy about their plight in these uncertain times? Doesn't Mr Keating's callous and insensitive throwaway line really reflect the attitude of someone who lives rent and mortgage free in a government provided home?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a grotesque caricature of the Prime Minister's position, and Senator Hill perfectly well knows it. Nobody in this government has been more conscious of the impact of economic mismanagement on ordinary Australians of the kind that occurred during the dark years of the Fraser-Howard period. No-one has been more conscious of the damage and the difficulty that are caused for people by a high inflation, low growth economy. Nobody is more conscious than the Prime Minister of the damage that flows from an economy that is inward looking, uncompetitive, unable to export and unable to generate the growth which generates the jobs which generates the standard of living maintenance in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it is the case that we are all intensely conscious of the immediate and direct impact that interest rate hikes have on ordinary Australians and in particular mortgage holders. The Prime Minister is acutely conscious of that. He has said that, in terms of our budgetary aspirations at the moment, one of the key objectives is to put the kind of budget down which will make any upward move in interest rates far less likely. He said as much on the radio program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> just a couple of days ago. He is very conscious of the need, as we all are, of the budget to accomplish just that kind of pressure, operating in that kind of direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also committed, so far as the longer term objectives of the fiscal exercise are concerned, to significantly tightening fiscal policy in the May budget so as to boost national savings, reduce Australia's call on overseas capital and generally make that side of economic management far more manageable. They are the aspirations that we have articulated. That is where we expect to get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that most Australians do understand that there is a necessity for growth in the Australian economy to be sustainable in character. Most Australians do understand that it is necessary accordingly on occasion to put on the brakes to ensure not that the economy comes to a halt but that it is maintainable at a sustainable momentum. It is like driving a car down the highway: if it is humanly possible, you try to organise your speed of approach to lights such that you keep on clicking through the green lights rather than having to stop and start at the red ones. That is exactly what we have been trying to do with the Australian economy&mdash;to so manage the dimensions of the economy that we do not have to bring the economy to a halt at a red light if we confront it, but to so organise the speed of the economic recovery and the sustainability of that recovery to ensure that we will go on clicking our way through green lights endlessly into the future. That is the objective and that is what we have been able to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interest rate increases that were necessary last year were designed to slow down the economy from that kind of over-exaggerated momentum 12 to 18 months out which produces a stop-start economy. We want to avoid that at all costs, and the interest rate increases in the latter part of last year were designed to do just that. It may well be, when the latest national account figures come out and we get a full picture of the economy, that it will be proven to have achieved just that and that the remaining disciplines on the economy can be imposed only by fiscal policy without the necessity to go further at all so far as interest rates are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is possible, if that is attainable, that is a very much to be hoped for and very much to be looked for result, because, of course, we are conscious of the impact of high interest rates not only on borrowers in the business community but also, of course, on home owners. That is the perspective from which the government operates in this respect, and it is a gross caricature and a gross calumny of the Prime Minister to suggest that he thinks any differently.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the minister of exactly what the Prime Minister said. He was talking about what might be referred to as middle Australians or mainstream Australians when he was belittling them. He said: `It is really down to the grindstone in the mortgage and nothing else.' He is talking about that in contrast to himself dealing with the big issues that face this country&mdash;the republic, our place in the world, and so forth. I put to the minister: why is the Prime Minister so out of touch? Why does he find it necessary apparently to continually talk down middle Australians, who are in fact battling with interest rates? Why does he not recognise that the policies of this government, as we saw in the late 1980s and we are seeing now again, are to continually push up interest rates to try to counter the current account and that in each instance it affects these people in middle Australia&mdash;ordinary Australians trying to pay off their mortgage? Why does he not demonstrate a little sensitivity towards their plight? And why don't you get up here and recognise it today and do likewise?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Interest rates in Australia at the moment are at historically low levels by comparison with the experience of past decades. They are much lower than the levels that prevailed during the mid-1980s and there is no question whatsoever in anyone's mind, in any commentator's mind, that interest rates are headed back north in the direction they were in the mid- to late 1980s. The economy is in a much sounder fundamental shape now than it was then as a result of the decade long attention that we have paid to basic fundamental economic reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have got is a high growth, low inflation, high investment, increasingly high employment economy which is sustainable. To do that, to make it sustainable, there has had to be some small interest rate increase. We are all trying very hard indeed to ensure that that will not need to go any further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that it may need to go further at some stage in an unpredictable future, it certainly will not have to go anything like as far as it has in the past.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. It is asked in circumstances where a very important delegation is going to America very soon led by you, Mr President, and Senator Troeth, who is very learned, may I say, in the area of the pastoral industry. Senator Colston is going too, and even I am going. Is the minister aware of recent comments by a designate of the United States Secretary for Agriculture, Mr Dan Glickman, referring to an Australian threat to the US grain industry? Is that a description that should be applied to the Australian rural industry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2220" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the United States Senate confirmation hearings for Mr Glickman last week, Mr Glickman stated that the export enhancement program, known as the EEP program, was introduced `to meet the European, Canadian'&mdash;and to our astonishment he went on to say this&mdash;`and Australian threat.' I have since read a transcript of what Mr Glickman actually said, and I was pleased to see that he did temper his remark in a subsequent exchange with Senator Richard Lugar when Mr Glickman said that the Australian threat had `diminished in recent years'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will certainly go one step further than Mr Glickman did. An Australian threat in the sense of a subsidy has never existed. This has been acknowledged in all previous explanations that have been given by relevant people in the United States, up to and including, I might add, the President of the United States. Statements in the past have focused solely on the threat of subsidised exports from the European Union. In fact, Australia has received assurances at the highest level&mdash;as I have just said, from the President&mdash;that the interests of Australia as a non-subsidised competitor would be taken into account when EEP subsidies were allocated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is not an export subsidiser. It is Australia that has had to penetrate markets that have been corrupted primarily by the United States and the European Union. Moreover, it is difficult to imagine&mdash;it is not difficult; it is impossible given the facts&mdash;how Australia could ever constitute a threat to United States producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major industry supported by the EEP is wheat. Australia currently supplies around 10 per cent of the world market compared with the 36 per cent supplied from the United States. As only the fourth largest supplier in the world, we are price takers. In good years&mdash;that is, non-drought years&mdash;there is a test to the limit of our wheat producing capacity. So there is little prospect of any expansion towards a dominant market share by Australia. It is simply not possible.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have time, Senator Panizza. Why don't you listen instead? The only threat that Australia presents to the US grain industry is as an efficient competitor. That was the disturbing element about what Mr Glickman said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this reality that appears to be the cause of some frustration for the Americans: for the billions of dollars that have been spent by American taxpayers on export subsidies since 1985, the US market share has stayed the same. So, if it is a test for United States taxpayers to put billions of dollars into subsidies to get a bigger share of the world market, I have to say that the EEP scheme has failed profoundly because the market share is the same now as it was in 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent farm policy debate in the United States has revealed an emerging trend towards the US engaging in a far more aggressive export policy to capture world markets. Under recent legislative changes, the EEP can now be employed in markets other than those distorted by European Union subsidies. The government is concerned that the EEP not be used as a trade development tool or be allocated on a regional or global basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that Mr Glickman, should the processes proceed satisfactorily, will be appointed as agriculture secretary before Easter. That being the case, both Senator McMullan and I will raise in our traditional letters of congratulations our concerns about Mr Glickman's perceptions of Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the decision by the South Australian government to contract out its management and operation of the E&amp;WS in South Australia. Many in industry, and some industry associations, have written to me voicing their concern about this approach. In the ring now, four consortia are bidding for the rights for this contract. All of them are foreign owned in the majority. Two of them are British and two of them are French. There are no Australian owned companies here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The South Australian government has acted in a way in which it excludes the opportunity for Australian companies to be properly formed and to bid for this project. It is true that some of the foreign owned companies have minority Australian shareholding. It is very important in a matter as fundamental to an economy as water, waste water and solid waste management that there be, in this strategic area of the economy, Australian ownership&mdash;at least for the majority of the operation&mdash;and in a way in which international skills can certainly be captured and utilised to Australian advantage, but under Australian ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those companies that have a minority Australian participation in them do so on the construction or financing side. Significantly, they do not have it in the area of technology, in the area of solid or liquid waste management or in the area of water management skills overall. This is a shame given that Australia has a number of very internationally competitive companies which are skilled in the area of water management, waste water management and solid and liquid waste management. Some of them, on the environmental technology side of their operations, have won international contracts overseas. They are excluded under this operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the principle that should operate here for a key strategic area of the economy is that it is for Australian companies to employ foreign skills under Australian ownership rather than leasing off key operations of Australian strategic importance to foreign companies employing Australian skills to their advantage. It is a fundamental question of industry policy and the development of capability in Australian industry that that principle be observed. This is not the principle that the South Australian government is observing. If it continues down its course, then this strategic area of the economy will effectively be in foreign hands and dominated by foreign companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, I have written to Mr Olsen about that. I have not at this point got a reply from him. So today, we try to clarify the great mystery on industry policy in Australia&mdash;where does the federal opposition stand? It is a mystery because no-one from the opposition benches has ever asked me a question, as industry minister, on industry policy; nor has anyone asked Mr Lee in the House of Representatives a question on industry policy and nor has anyone raised any questions on industry policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. I draw the minister's attention to the recent survey by the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia. Minister, do you agree with the survey's findings that the Commonwealth collected $3.8 billion in taxes on alcohol and tobacco in 1993-94 but spent only $36.4 million on specific drug and alcohol programs and services? If so, what is the explanation for that gap, considering that drug and alcohol abuse costs the Australian community at least $20 million a year? Finally, while the states and territories spend somewhere between 2.9 per cent and 24 per cent of what they collect for such programs and services on those services and the Commonwealth manages only one per cent, is it not about time for a considerable increase in the Commonwealth's financial commitment to education, intervention, treatment, research and other drug and alcohol related programs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I have to say that I have not seen the report by the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council. I do not know the accuracy of those figures, but I have no reason to dispute the collection of $3.8 billion from an excise on tobacco and alcohol. The implication of the question is why we are spending only $34 million and not all of the excise on the treatment of drug and alcohol abuse. That is to misunderstand what the collection of excise is for.

She then says that the Commonwealth spends only one per cent of its budget. I will certainly check that figure. I have not been provided with any detailed analysis of that one per cent figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is true that the Commonwealth is also quite considerably involved in a variety of programs dealing with the difficulties of managing not only illicit drugs but also licit drugs, particularly alcohol and tobacco. It does that through a number of its national programs and research. It also assists, other than by allocated dollars, through an anti-smoking or anti-alcohol strategy. I will certainly see whether there is any detailed information I can provide for Senator Lees. But to conclude that we should churn back into the campaign against smoking and alcohol abuse the $3 billion we raise from excise is to misunderstand the intent of our excise collection.</PARA>

I am certainly not talking about all of it; we are looking at a realistic level in the states of putting four or five per cent back into drug and alcohol related programs. If the Commonwealth is not going to do that, those people will frequently end up in our hospital system, which is the most expensive end of our health service, as a whole range of services will be missing. I ask the minister: does the Commonwealth not have some responsibility? Is not the very small amount of money put back&mdash;it is about $2 per head; compare that with the Northern Territory, which is putting back $55 per head of what it raises in drug and alcohol taxes&mdash;only a fraction of what is needed?</PARA></TALK.START>

It is clearly understood by government that if it can prevent large, expensive hospitalisation by way of treatment down the illness trail post long-time cigarette use or post alcohol abuse, it is a much better thing to do.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I think I have said before, the question of the non-proliferation treaty review and extension conference, commencing in three weeks in New York, is probably the most important issue facing the international community this year. It is crucially important to get this one right. Australia is very firmly continuing to argue for an indefinite extension of that treaty. We do so essentially for three reasons. First, so far as the nuclear weapons states are concerned, we think that indefinite extension will offer far and away the most encouragement for them to continue the process of disarmament and nuclear arms reduction on which they have already embarked. It will enable this far more so than at any previous time under the START I and II treaties and related measures of that kind. The uncertainty generated by a non-indefinite extension and the prospect of proliferation elsewhere would be the last thing calculated to encourage that process to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, so far as the twilight zone countries are concerned&mdash;I will not name them, but I think we know who they are&mdash;who are either thought to have nuclear weapons, although not declared, or are on the threshold of being able to do so, again it is our very firm view that indefinite extension is far and away the best way to maintain the discipline on them not to go any further or hopefully to wind back. If you create an environment in which intellectual credibility is given to the possibility of proliferation being allowed and not outlawed by the international community, you do not help in any way maintain the pressure on those twilight zone states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, so far as those other countries which have no intention ever of getting into the nuclear arms business but want access to peaceful nuclear technology and material supplies are concerned, again indefinite extension is the best environment within which they can be guaranteed supply, their needs satisfied and their political willingness accordingly to support the maintenance of non-proliferation of weapons can be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a nutshell, they are the reasons why we are supporting indefinite extension. It has nothing to do with the fact that those arguments have also appealed to a number of the existing nuclear weapon states. We make our own judgment about these things and we are continuing to work hard at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To answer your specific question, it is the case that neither Indonesia nor Malaysia has yet reached a final position on the question of NPT extension. They are reserving  their positions, and a number of countries like them are expected to do so, until the actual parties make their decision, which will not be until around the second week of May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been very actively involved, personally and through correspondence, in lobbying a number of these countries, not just in our own region, and I will continue to do that. There are a number of regional countries which have already expressed strong support for indefinite extension including Japan, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea and the member states of the South Pacific Forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to your last question about South Africa, it may well be the case that the kind of extension that it is talking about with rolling fixed extensions is permissible under the terms of article 10 of the treaty. Article 10 identifies several different options for extension after this current period has expired, as it has&mdash;that is, indefinite, fixed or for fixed periods. That is not the point. The argument is not whether it is legally permissible to come up with one or other of these models&mdash;and South Africa, to our knowledge, has not firmly advocated any particular position; it is just stating an option&mdash;the argument is about the policy choices that we should be making. For all the reasons I have already indicated, Australia is of the very firm view that that policy choice ought to be for indefinite extension.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the signing of the historic Israel-PLO accord in September 1993, the PLO has assumed a recognised and absolutely crucial role on behalf of Palestinians in the negotiations toward Palestinian autonomy on the West Bank and the Gaza. Despite the various difficulties, some of them quite severe, which have arisen between parties since 1993, particularly in the last few months, both sides have continued to work through their differences with a view to making the accord work. In the course of these negotiations, the PLO's role has not been questioned by the international community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year PLO leaders expressed their disappointment over the state as they saw it of Australia's relations with the PLO and sought an official invitation from Australia for a senior political figure nominated by them to visit this country. I agreed to that in principle. Subsequently, I was informed that the PLO had nominated Farouk Kaddoumi, the head of the PLO political department and, perhaps more importantly, chairman of the Board of Governors of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction&mdash;PECDAR. Despite the atmosphere of controversy surrounding Mr Kaddoumi, of which I have long been well aware, I took the view that, given his senior position within the PLO hierarchy and my previous agreement in principle to accept a PLO nominee, the visit should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had no doubt, firstly, that Mr Kaddoumi has long been one of those within the PLO most reluctant to enter into the peace process in the first place; secondly, that he is one of those most keen to maintain the resistance option, and; thirdly, that he is one of those most critical of the present peace process and the frustrations and difficulties and failures so far along the way. There is a view about Mr Kaddoumi in some Western capitals that his views are not as bad as they sound&mdash;rather like, as some people have said, Wagner's musical works&mdash;but I am left in some doubt about that, having had a substantial meeting with him. There was more than a little ambiguity about some of Mr Kaddoumi's responses to me but, certainly, I have to say he is at the less moderate, more tough-minded end of the PLO's spectrum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main point of the meeting was really to communicate clearly to Mr Kaddoumi Australia's views on the matters in issue in the Middle East peace process. I certainly took that opportunity to convey Australia's very strong support for the peace process and for the Oslo accords and our absolute opposition to political objectives ever being pursued by violent means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity was taken to emphasise our support for democratic elections and respect for human rights by the Palestinian authority. Moreover, I urged Mr Kaddoumi to see the importance for confidence building purposes of early fulfilment of the PLO's commitment to submit to the Palestinian National Council for formal approval the necessary changes to its covenant of those elements which are incompatible with Israel's right to exist as recognised, or at least implicitly recognised, in the declaration of principles signed between Israel and the PLO in September 1993. I also urged him to see the Arab boycott of Israel as an obsolete relic since the Oslo accords and to continue to support the Israel-Jordan peace treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I advised Mr Kaddoumi that the Australian government will continue to stand behind those parties which have the courage and commitment to go on with the search for peace, which began with the Oslo accords. We do, of course, continue to support very strongly the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and, if they wish, to an independent state alongside a secure Israel. We absolutely reject and condemn political violence. I repeated that view on a number of occasions&mdash;that all peoples of the region have the right to be free from threats of violence from any quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit of Mr Kaddoumi was consistent with the pattern of contact with the PLO followed by a number of Western governments for a number of years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. I refer the minister to the evidence before the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on 6 March which shows that private patient numbers in public hospitals have declined by 25 per cent over the last four years. I ask: is it correct that the Commonwealth and state ministers have agreed that the trigger for a review of the Medicare agreement was actually reached last November? Is it correct that the Commonwealth has made no extra payments to the states despite lower numbers of private patients and that Victoria is owed $59 million to compensate for the decline in private patient numbers over the last 15 months? When will the minister renegotiate the Medicare agreement with the states and what will the Commonwealth do to ensure that any additional Commonwealth funds provided to the states are not used by state governments as an excuse to further reduce state funding to hospitals.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question is very much the same as the question asked by Senator Lees yesterday about South Australia. The answer to the question is much the same as what I said yesterday. Yes, indeed, Senator Spindler, the two per cent trigger was reached. That was agreed and work has started as a consequence of that. A review is being conducted by a working group of Commonwealth and state officers which first met on 18 November 1994 and that has produced an interim report which has shown, beyond doubt now, some very, very important and interesting statistics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They show for Victoria, as they have shown for New South Wales and for South Australia, that Commonwealth money to the state of Victoria has increased over the last three years while at the same time the Victorian state government has withdrawn money. I will read the figures for you, Senator. The Victorian state government money in 1991-92 was $1,133 million. In 1992-93 it fell to $1,055 million. In 1993-94 it fell further to $973 million. That is a drop of 7.61 per cent in real terms from 1992 to 1994, with the fall being 8.75 per cent between 1993 and 1994. So if the Victorian state government wants to say that it is having trouble dealing with waiting lists and costs in Victoria, why is it cutting its own health dollars? Why is it cutting expenditure on the hospitals and why is it that Victoria is one of the very rare places where all the doctors in the public health system have recently protested against the cuts in health funding in Victoria?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian state government has taken the Commonwealth increased funding and used that as a cover to reduce its own funding. It has savagely cut funding in Victoria. It has savagely damaged the opportunities for hospitals in Victoria, to the point where the doctors in those hospitals have actually publicly agitated against those cuts. It is not something that Victoria should be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To go to the other points of your question, Senator Spindler, the review committee is trying to work on what exactly are the costs that might be consequent on that two per cent trigger. There has been quite clearly a fall in the number of privately insured patients. No-one disagrees with that. A large number of those are young people and they are not putting a cost on the public sector, but one could assume that there is some small increased cost on the public sector. It is not possible to put a figure on it yet, and it is one of the things the review is working on. At the same time, the review is also looking at what adjustments may have to be made because of the deliberate cost shifting by the Victorian state government on to the Commonwealth&mdash;a point I alluded to vis-a-vis South Australia in answer to a question from Senator Lees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Medicare agreements are in place for the next five years and those Medicare agreements, from the Commonwealth's point of view, guarantee ongoing increased real funding to the states. If the states are serious about the problems in their hospitals, then they should look to their own expenditure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer, but I am no apologist for the Victorian government and I certainly know of the cuts undertaken in this area by the Victorian government. My question was, in part: what will the Minister for Health and the Commonwealth government do to stop state governments using increased Commonwealth funding, if and when they receive it, in this manner and off-loading the load on to the Commonwealth? The issue still remains that Victoria is entitled to an increased Commonwealth contribution and the minister might indicate, having said that there is a review party in progress, when that increased funding could be identified and paid. But, more particularly, what will the minister do to ensure that this additional funding is not used by the states to shirk their responsibilities?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some things under the Medicare agreements that the Commonwealth can do. One of those is, on the data provided, to make sure&mdash;and it would need to be something that the Commonwealth was sure about&mdash;that public patients are being denied public services for which Commonwealth money is provided to the states, as there is a penalty under the Medicare agreements and the states could expect to be penalised because of that. That is one trigger, particularly in cost shifting areas, where the minister has indicated that, on any evidence coming that puts that beyond a doubt, she intends to be very tough with the states in that breaking of the contractual understanding of Medicare agreements which require the state hospitals to provide that facility and those services for anybody in the state who applies to get them. That is one thing that the Commonwealth can do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is anything that the minister might want to provide by way of a further answer, I will certainly get it for the senator. But I just reiterate: it is pretty terrible of the Victorian government and very bold and galling that Minister Tehan cuts money like mad out of the state budget and then protests that she has not got enough to deal with the waiting lists. If Minister Tehan wants to fix that, it is entirely within her own purview to do it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senators will know that the CeBIT fair, held every year in Hanover, Germany, is the premier international event for information technology. This year Australia was the preferred exhibitor and co-hosted the CeBIT fair. Senators will know that the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Keating, went and participated in the opening of that fair to assist Australian industry in the promotion of our information technology capability and our telecommunications industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> has reported today, Austrade has forecast that approximately $310 million of sales will be made during the next 12 months as a direct consequence of Australia's participation in CeBIT 95. In fact, exhibitors at CeBIT, which as I said was held in Hanover, have actually forecast $443 million in feedback reports received by Austrade from 63 of the 156 exhibitors who participated in that fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Austrade forecast is a conservative one, based on experience which has shown that around 70 per cent of anticipated sales materialise. This would represent a rise of 15 per cent in Australian exports of information technology and telecommunications products and services as a result of our endeavours at CeBIT 95. Some $21 million in orders was actually written by 14 Australian exhibitors during the fair. This achievement, I believe, is a tribute to the excellence of Australian information technology companies which participated and the world-class products that they, as Australian companies, can offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two examples given by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today illustrate the range of technologies that the Australian information industry is capable of offering to the world. The Perth based smart card company signed a $16 million contract for a hand-held home automation product. Another company, Open Software Associates, is reported to have signed a very large contract with Germany's second largest private bank, the Dresdner, concerning banking software technology. The results are in part due to the efforts that the Prime Minister put into promoting Australian companies at this premiere international event. This was a serious effort by the government to work hand in hand with the private sector in promoting Australia's image in information technology and throwing our best representative of the nation into the fray to help achieve that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was the fifth largest exhibitor at CeBIT this year, putting it ahead of countries such as France, Italy, Switzerland and Canada. Australian exhibitors demonstrated highly advanced information technology systems for electronic data interchange and export mining and manufacturing systems. In many cases, Australia's systems for smart cards, EFTPOS and immigration passport checks were the best available in the world. Companies marketing these systems are already well established in the European market. In addition, Australia offered highly advanced telecommunications products and software applications for business, finance, accounting, personal information management and appointment tracking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to the Austrade report. Of the 156 exhibitors, 117 have reported back on their marketing  activities.

Of those firms reporting, 32 supported existing agents or distributors, 47 successfully launched new products, 82 felt they had reinforced their corporate image, 16 forecast substantial growth in market share and six secured more than $15 million in venture capital. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning in the Legislative Assembly in Queensland a Mr Allan Grice gave a speech on certain matters, most of which are fantasy. I will respond to only one aspect of it&mdash;the aspect that refers to me. He said in his speech the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Minister, Senator Ray, was a participant in a vital meeting held in a Sydney restaurant in May of 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those at the meeting included Richardson&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the former senator&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ray, the crooked businessman Robert James Burgess, his partner Peter Lynn Rovazzini, and at least one senior official of McDonnell Douglas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without the cooperation of the Government, the scam could never have got off the ground, let alone net players like Burgess millions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, I was not invited to such a meeting. Secondly, I did not attend such a meeting. Thirdly, I understand that it was alleged that the meeting occurred at the Park Lane Hotel, a hotel I have never visited in my life. Fourthly, I was not in Sydney not only on 20 May when this was alleged to have occurred but on any day in May 1993. Some honourable senators will recall that we sat for four weeks in May 1993. We were all here for the whole month of May. On the day in question, the day I was supposed to have been at this lunch, Senator Brownhill will remember that he asked me a question about the disposal of aircraft. If Senator MacGibbon were here, he would recall that all of us debated it after question time when the question was taken note of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can also say for the record that I have never met any defence industry representatives in the current company of Senator Richardson. In fact, from the time I have been sworn in as defence minister, which was on 4 April 1990, Senator Richardson&mdash;maybe it is a fault of his&mdash;has never once raised a defence issue with me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have indicated in answer to Senator Chapman's question that the normal procedure for dealing with defence industry representatives&mdash;and this is a wise precaution, I think, because we are dealing in tens and sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars&mdash;is that I meet them in my office with a staff member present and a departmental member present. I do that for the very obvious reason that I do not want to be misrepresented afterwards and so that there will be a file note on every meeting that I have had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to meetings with McDonnell Douglas, what is really surprising is that I have had only one official meeting with it. Normally with such companies, or Lockheed or others, you might have one meeting each year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill interjects, and it probably was not picked up, but the reason is that McDonnell Douglas had the big F18 project and now it is back looking for the lead-in fighter project. Senator Chapman has asked 54 questions on notice. I have to say to Senator Chapman that I did pick up the import of them. I was very tempted to answer those relating to me and not the rest of the questions until they could be got together, but I was advised by my department that that is not the normal procedure. Otherwise, you would have got a very early response to those questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also had a dispute with Senator Chapman today as to whether he was fed information by the CJC.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapman: That's correct.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite properly, if any allegations are made about offset rorts or export of dual technology, they are a matter not for the CJC but for federal authorities. The Australian Federal Police from last November have investigated these two matters thoroughly, and will report. There has been no political interference in the investigation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did mention earlier, and I have to say here in my personal explanation, that it is not good enough in modern society for National Crime Authority-type organisations like the CJC to deliberately put this stuff in the public domain. Let me give you the classic example of it. It contacts Defence and asks for information on general defence offsets. It is given the name of an officer and a direct line phone number. Within two days a muckraking journalist rings that officer about defence offsets. The telephone number quite clearly was given by the CJC for that journalist to follow up her inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say&mdash;I am coming towards the end&mdash;it is coincidental that we get a question in this chamber and Mr Grice's attack in Queensland.

No-one on this side quarrels for a moment with Senator Ray's sense of outrage, given that what is said about him would appear to be manifestly untrue. It is perfectly proper for him to react in the way that he did. But, if we are to be able to assess precisely what is going on in Queensland, and particularly what information comes before the Queensland parliament, it would also be helpful if Senator Ray could be pro-active in enabling this parliament to make a judgment about the role of national law enforcement agencies. In the last 12 months, we have been trying to ascertain the extent to which the NCA and the Federal Police have been involved with the CJC in general and with Operation Wallah in particular. These matters obviously have a flow-on relationship to the offsets inquiry that is currently under way. Therefore, Senator Ray could best put matters on the table and clear the air by, perhaps in discussion with some of his colleagues, providing this chamber with a full detail of the history of the NCA and the Federal Police in relation to these Queensland investigations.</PARA></TALK.START>

If they have nothing to hide, let us hear about it. We should get a chronology of when they were first asked to provide assistance.

But if the reality is that at every turn the CJC has found that it has not been able to get any assistance from the federal authorities, then one begins to understand why it might feel a high level of frustration.

But in these circumstances, there are too many coincidences. Therefore, we can proceed, but I believe that Senator Ray owes this parliament an explanation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The difficulty with this whole debate is illustrated by what has happened here. Senator Robert Ray has been accused of gross misbehaviour and has made a very forceful rebuttal of the suggestions made about him. As I understand it, nobody on the other side has done anything but accept his explanation. But having accepted his explanation, they then said, `Nevertheless, he should have done more to forward the investigations. This government should have given the CJC a better go,' but they have given no explanation as to why the government should have done this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this, those opposite have said that they accept that Senator Ray is absolutely innocent of any suggestion made, but they continue to create an atmosphere that somehow leaves him in touch with the allegations made against him. I would have thought the proper way to deal with this issue was to say, `Senator Ray, we accept what you have said. We don't want to continue with the allegations that we have made.' That would be the proper way to deal with these things. There are some real worries about what is happening in the Senate at the moment. I was disgusted yesterday to receive a document through the fax about a senator whom I hold in high regard. There was no explanation; it was just fed through the fax machine and circulated to me. </PARA>

They should have been raised in a debate separate to Senator Ray's rebuttal of this allegation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These other matters that Senator Boswell has talked about as to what should happen and what the CJC has been through, whether it has had cooperation from the Federal Police or not, should be brought up separately. It is a legitimate issue if we want to debate it, but it is wrong to introduce that sort of material at a time when a person has made a personal explanation. If somebody gets up and makes an explanation and says, `I didn't do this' and everybody says, `Yes, we accept what you say' but then go on to fudge the edges to that acceptance, then there are some real problems. </PARA>

I find those two bodies, the NCA and the Federal Police, to be staffed by people of the utmost rectitude and integrity, but that is a matter for another debate.

I also assure him that it was absolutely coincidental that this question was asked on the same day that certain statements were made in the Queensland parliament. In fact it was only just before question time that I became aware those statements had been made, well after this particular question that I asked was drafted and planned for today. I give him that absolute assurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area where the minister in answering the question misrepresented me was his claim that, in an interview on the Murray Nicoll program on radio 5AN in Adelaide on 7 June last year, I identified the Criminal Justice Commission as the source of the information that I had used for questions directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Justice in this place in May-June of last year. I am aware that the Minister for Justice, Mr Kerr, has for a couple of weeks been bandying this transcript around to various people claiming that this is irrefutable evidence that the Criminal Justice Commission was the source of my information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just go to the detail of the transcript to show quite clearly that is not the case. The transcript states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NICOLL: Right, so police leaked the information to you about Sen Richardson to put pressure on the Govt . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CHAPMAN: I'm not indicating who particularly made the information available, but people involved in law enforcement in Queensland . . .</PARA>

<PARA>He then goes on to ask a second question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This information has come from Fed Police, right.</PARA>
<PARA>I am then, in fact, in responding to that, answering his first question; in other words, `Who were the bodies that were having a look at this issue?' The transcript states:</PARA>

At no time have I indicated the source of the documents to which I referred in asking those questions in the Senate last year and, indeed, even in this interview I was very careful not to do that.

<PARA>Senator Crowley, in her answer today, gave the Senate a lot of information in relation to the use of tampons, which was useful and informative. What she sought to do, however, was to avoid the principal issue at stake, which was the violation of this family's privacy and the violation of the privacy of the young girl who died. That is really what is at stake. It is very clear from the minister's answer that she made information from a post-mortem available to journalists without asking the permission of the parents of this 13-year-old girl. Senator Crowley's defence was that she did not divulge the name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the other place this afternoon, Dr Lawrence admitted that the girl's identity was well known. So the defence that Senator Crowley put forward, that she did not divulge the name when she gave out the details of the post-</PARA>
<PARA>mortem, is a pretty pathetic defence, given that her senior minister has already acknowledged the fact that this girl's death and her identity were well-known facts in the public arena. To whom else were these details supposed to relate but to the girl in question? What was supposed to be added to the grand total of public knowledge by divulging these very detailed, personal matters that related to the post-mortem? What was the added benefit to the public and, if there was an added benefit to the public, why did not Senator Crowley have the decency to at least ask this girl's family first?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> From the evidence that Senator Crowley presented to the Senate this afternoon, it appears that she had the information for at least a couple of days. At some stage between her receiving the information from the Therapeutic Goods Administration and her releasing it on 13 March, you would have thought that she would have had the decency to phone the parents. But, no, that did not happen. In fact, the parents told me yesterday they still have not heard from Senator Crowley notwithstanding her liberal use of their daughter's private post-mortem details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley has to explain to the Senate why she did not consult these parents before she released this information. What was so urgent that she could not wait even to make a phone call to the parents before rushing off to the media? What was it that was added to the import of this matter by releasing the details of this poor girl's post-mortem before the inquest had even been held? What was it that was added to her press release? Why was it that Senator Crowley, from her explanation, gave out a three-page summary and then, when people wanted more information, gave out a 12-page document from the Therapeutic Goods Administration? What was contained in those documents? What was the benefit in releasing that information? Did she weigh up the benefit against the enormous distress that she would cause?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley is a minister with enormous responsibilities in relation to these matters. A minister with those responsibilities has to consider each and every action carefully, instead of rushing off to the media in some unseemly haste to somehow boost a press release. This is a thoroughly, thoroughly disappointing matter and I hope that Senator Crowley will explain her actions and explain why she chose to so grossly violate the privacy of this family at a time when they were mourning for a very dear 13-year-old daughter. </PARA>

You sought to mislead and, in my view, you have done so again in what is a quite pathetic and dishonourable explanation that you have offered, which is in marked contrast to that of your senior minister, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). It is abundantly clear why she is senior to you. Unlike you, who have only been able to express sympathy with the family, the senior minister stood up in the other place and apologised to the family for any hurt that was caused by this release&mdash;something you could not bring yourself to do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have satisfied ourselves that you did release the information.

It was not, but let me read to you what is at the commencement of the report: it names the date, the age and the town that the young girl came from. From the minister's own answer that we heard this afternoon, there are so few cases of toxic shock or alleged toxic shock that all the world would know whose details these were. More importantly, the family and friends know whose details these are that you released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your senior minister can spot that. The senior minister, the minister for health, in the other place has acknowledged that the publicity surrounding this matter, the death of this girl, was such that whether you named her or not did not matter; everyone knew whom you were talking about. Don't let the minister pretend there was no identification. There is the date, the age and the town, and in her own answer she made it clear how few cases there were. For the minister to try and scramble out from this disgraceful exercise by the gossamer thread that she did not actually name the child is somewhat pathetic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal briefly with the response. You, minister, say that this matter was trawled in here by Senator O'Chee weeks later.

I have dealt with your defence that you did not name the child. It is pathetic and clearly shows why you are the junior minister to Carmen Lawrence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to briefly contribute to this debate. This is a serious matter. The Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) might walk away from it. Not only was her answer in question time misleading but she sought to take a series of technical defences. Firstly, she sought to avoid facing up to her responsibility by interpreting Senator O'Chee's question as referring apparently to a three-page document. She kept interjecting saying that the question referred to the three-page document, but it did not at all. She did that because she wanted to avoid facing up to the fact that she had distributed to selected journalists the 12-page post-mortem report. She did not want to say so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can only interpret that answer as being misleading. In terms of parliamentary practice, there are few more serious offences than deliberately misleading the parliament. Perhaps there is something that is more serious in this instance: why did she distribute this highly personal, sensitive material to selected journalists without first obtaining the approval of the parents of the girl? Why did she act in such an insensitive way? We still have not had an explanation for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication in what she is saying is that she did it as a matter of public health and that it was necessary for this detail to be distributed to journalists in order to enhance the public health debate in this country. That is patent nonsense, isn't it? The personal biological details of the post-mortem were not relevant to the journalist writing that the girl suffered shocking trauma and died. No defence has been put to the Senate at all as to why she did distribute it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the minister has hesitated in acknowledging that she distributed the 12-page report to selected journalists. Secondly, she has put up no defence to it. Thirdly, as I hear her, she still has not apologised to the parents for what she did. Her senior minister did in the other chamber but she has not come in here and apologised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but Senator Crowley is the guilty party. After having all these opportunities today, she still has not come in here and apologised to the parents for the offence that she caused them. What is her justification in doing that, other than a failure to meet responsibility? We expect of ministers reasonable standards of public behaviour. She erred in this instance. She made a bad error of judgment. She caused grave offence to the parents of this girl. She sought to avoid meeting that responsibility in this place and she still has not got the guts to come in here and apologise to the parents for the offence that she has caused them. That is a pretty appalling performance; it is an appalling record. I believe that it does justify censure of this chamber.

I expected to hear her say, `I made an error of judgment. I caused offence. I apologise for that offence. I also apologise to the extent to which I may have misled the Senate.' Adopting the practice that the minister did yesterday in another matter, I will later seek leave to give a notice of motion tomorrow that the Senate censure the minister, Senator Crowley, firstly, for her insensitivity in releasing to journalists personal details of a post-mortem of an under-age girl without first obtaining the consent of that girl's parents; secondly, for failing to apologise to the parents of the girl for the offence caused to them; and, thirdly, for misleading the Senate at question time by at first denying that she had released such details and in other ways. I adopt the same procedure as Senator Evans did yesterday because I want to give Senator Crowley another opportunity to come in here and put the record straight and apologise.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some weeks ago I asked Senator Crowley a question about the home and community care program. I got the same answer as I got today: no answer at all. I want to read to the Senate extracts from a letter I received from Grey Power New South Wales in response to the answer that Senator Crowley gave me on that occasion.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on the subject of home care which she refused to answer.</PARA>
<PARA>This letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some pensioners are absolutely dependent on this assistance to maintain a minimum lifestyle and levels of hygiene in their homes. The cost of this vital home assistance can be anything around the $19 per hour mark.</PARA>

He should return any trophies he may have received for being named the World's Greatest Treasurer immediately. Quoting the title the poor pensioners of this country now give him may get me into trouble and the appropriate trophy going with those titles is distinctly on the nose, the same as this callous government is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the raking up of old records and comparisons of what happened 15 years ago that Keating now relies on so strongly will not cure the problems pensioners have now.

<PARA>That is the message. I am sure that the writer of this letter will have been listening to or watching question time today when I asked the same question about home and community care, asking the minister to give assurances to this Senate that the government would not cut funding for the home and community care program, a vital program for caring for people in their own homes, caring for people with disabilities, caring for those who are frail and, in particular, caring for those who have dementia and enabling their carers to have respite and enabling them to have assistance in their homes. </PARA>

<PARA>We again had today evidence of the way in which this federal Labor government is proposing to rip more money away from the students in universities in Australia. We have had a number of cases over the last few years, in legislation and in other forms, of the government increasing the burden placed on students. We have seen over the 12 years of this Labor government a move from no fees to a position of greater imposition of fees. It started originally with an administrative charge of about $400. This was then converted into the HECS scheme, which has gradually risen over the years to a level of about $2,400 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now heard that the government is proposing in the next budget a further increase; and this, we believe, is supported by the Department of Finance and by the Treasury, and what they plan to do is put this up by another $1,000. If you multiply that across the student body of Australia, which is 450,000 students, this reaps for the government an incredible amount of money. This is on top of other measures in recent times whereby the government has increased the repayment rate of HECS and lowered the level of income at which HECS has to be repaid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unclaimed debt of HECS to the government from students is now reaching $2 billion, and we have a Treasury and a Department of Finance starved of funds who see this $2 billion out there and want to get it back as quickly as possible by raising the repayment rates and lowering the level of income at which it is reclaimed. Now we find yet again that this is not an adjustment that is in line with the CPI. As a matter of fact, it is way out of line with the CPI. It is an absolutely massive increase&mdash;from 23 per cent to 30 per cent.One would ask why a Labor government wants to really slug one of the poorest groups in the community. As we all know, and I am sure that probably all of us in this chamber were students at one stage&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not all on the other side, obviously. But we all know how difficult it is, as a student, to make ends meet. Yet this government is increasingly putting a larger and larger burden upon a group who cannot afford to repay. Why is the government doing it? It is doing it because of two things. One relates to the lack of public money it is prepared to put into university education at a time when it has expanded the system. It has expanded the system by about 40 per cent since 1988, but it has not expanded the resources to match that. What we see with this proposed measure is the government yet again trying to grab from a poor group in the community to make up the funding shortfalls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the students who vented their rage about fees against this government last week&mdash;an unprecedented action by students in the 12 years of this government&mdash;should be out again after the budget protesting about this government, which misled them and lied to them before the last election when it said that it was the party that would keep fees at a lower level. Of course, it has turned out to be the high-fee party. After the budget, the students of this country should certainly protest. When they get to the ballot box at the next election the students of this country, and their parents, should definitely vote against this deceptive and lying government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Greens are pleased that the government has seen reason and decided to extend the exemption of married Austudy recipients under the age of 22 from the Sex Discrimination Act. The government has been using the expiry of this exemption as justification to knock 2,100 married students off Austudy, which was a selective enforcement of a legal provision to save money and force students off their only income. The Greens realise that, by extending the exemption, there will be temporary discrimination for single students and de facto students while married students continue to collect Austudy. However, we believe that this can be the only outcome while DEET operates with such a flawed definition of the `independent rate of Austudy', the basis of which is age discrimi nation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has agreed to conditions within the Sex Discrimination Act exemption, which means that a working party will come up with an alternative definition to the independent rate of Austudy. This move is welcomed by the Greens. The government will also undertake a review of the Sex Discrimination Act exemption for married Austudy students at the same time as it reviews the Sex Discrimination Act exemption for the tax act and the Social Security Act. At the moment, the whole of the Social Security Act is exempt from the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens found it hard to believe that married students were being targeted while so many other exemptions under the Sex Discrimination Act still existed. When the Greens saw the implications of taking away those exemptions, we expressed our deepest concerns that this legal process may have been used to cut more people off allowances and create savings for the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We often see the government using the tool of making things consistent or non-discriminatory as a guise for disadvantaging sections of the community. I am very concerned that in this exemption review process the government will be looking to remove as many exemptions from the Sex Discrimination Act as possible, even if it disadvantages the people it is meant to protect, which is women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen this with the increase in the female retirement age, which was an economic measure rather than a social equity one. I also fear that the Social Security Act will be slashed of its marital allowances. The government will invariably go for the least cost option, even when the objectives are to supposedly improve social policy. The social policy objectives will be innocently pursued, and the working party may be overruled by the economic rationalism of the present government. The result will be one of compromised social policy and hard-won games of the social sector being forced down to the lowest common denominator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, though the Greens have fought hard for this exemption and for married students to retain Austudy, we realise that this is only a temporary measure for the government. We realise that this measure is not a solution and that the solution lies with redefining the independent rate of Austudy by more appropriate and non-discriminatory criteria. However, we are concerned that this process will be used as a justification for cutting back social spending. We fear that we will again be fighting the same issue at the end of 1996. We will be fighting this principle over a number of policy areas instead of just one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I want to put the government's position on the statement made by Senator Margetts. Since the Austudy regulations were disallowed by the Senate on 9 February 1995, the government has been carefully considering the position of the entitlement of all students, particularly married students, to the independent rate of Austudy. The government has been concerned to not disadvantage students as a result of the disallowance or maintaining its commitment to a non-discriminatory students assistance scheme. In particular, the government has been concerned about the fact that the disallowance removed the grandfather clause, financially disadvantaging up to 1,200 students under the age of 22 who received Austudy last year on the basis of marriage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has now addressed the situation of married students and Austudy. It has resolved any uncertainty which might have resulted from the disallowance of the proposed regulations. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) yesterday announced that an exemption covering Austudy payments to married students has been granted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That was a decision of the commissioner, not the government. This exemption will now allow Austudy to be paid at the independent rate for all married students subject to the relevant income and assets test. This exemption will continue until the end of 1996. During this time, the government has established a task force which will review the granting of independent status under Austudy with a view to finding criteria which are not discriminatory but which reflect the community's view of who should receive Austudy benefits. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is obviously sensitive, because it realises that what it did represented an appalling abuse to young married students. It tried to argue that students who have left home and are married are no longer independent. It was basically a cost saving measure. It tried to argue that it had no choice but to reduce the Austudy payments to these students because of provisions in the Sex Discrimination Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We said from the outset that a number of different options were open to the government. It could amend the act or seek a further exemption. There were also a couple of other options. For several weeks, it refused to consider those options. It dug in and said that it was not going to. It said that it had no choice other than the process it adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we used the procedures of this Senate to in effect force it to reconsider. We started that process by moving a disallowance of its regulations, which were going to set in concrete the removal of the independent rate of Austudy from married students under the age of 22. I am very pleased that we have received the support of the minority parties in this chamber. The defeat of those regulations forced the government back to the sex discrimination commissioner. It had to consider what other options were open to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next important aspect is the outcry by students and student unions. This was another instance in which the government was breaking its promise to Australian students. There have been so many areas in which this government has done that since the last election. There have been many occasions when the opposition and minority parties have had to do our best to keep the government honest. This was just another example of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The technique adopted was that an amendment moved by the Australian Democrats to one of the miscellaneous bills tacked on an amendment that would have the same effect. The result of these various pressures was that the government had no alternative in the end but to accept that it had been in error and to find a solution. The solution it adopted was a negotiation with the sex discrimination commissioner, which has further extended the exemption for two years under the Sex Discrimination Act. The problem has been partially solved for two years. Students will be pleased about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is not a final solution. All I can say is that, fortunately, in two years we do not expect this government to be in office. We expect that Australia will again be under good government. The solution that Australian students will receive will be not only fair but one which recognises that when students leave home they are independent, irrespective of whether the Australian Labor Party realises it. </PARA>

The commission has worked out the obvious course of action that the government should have worked out in the first place&mdash;that is, that this group obviously should have an exemption. It is a great pity that the government did not have the commonsense to work this out in the first place. Instead it subjected the chamber to the time wasting process of putting up a piece of legislation that was going to raise about $100,000&mdash;that is all it was going to raise&mdash;and, if successful, therefore severely discriminate against a group of students on the ground that they are married. It should have been obvious to the government that a lot of these people have moved away from home, often live in different states to their parents and do not rely on their parents. Why on earth should the income of their parents be taken into account in calculating their Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>

In the future, let us hope that the government considers whether these matters are serious before it brings them before the Senate and wastes our time. I think the legislation on this occasion certainly did waste our time. It is good to see that this matter has now been resolved and that this rather silly measure has been disallowed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I agree with the comments that Senator Hill made in addressing this matter and I also agree with the reasons Senator Margetts gave for pursuing this matter. It is a victory for the Senate that this action by the commissioner has led to the matter being resolved in a temporary sense. I wish to address a phrase Senator Schacht used when describing the state of the situation as it is at the moment. I think it is important to draw out this particular phrase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister led us to believe that students had been receiving Austudy on the basis of their marriage. That is inaccurate. We need to address that fact and acknowledge that what was occurring was that students were receiving Austudy on the basis of their marriage being part of the definition of independence that was used by the department at that time. It is that inadequacy which has led to this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts is right in drawing attention to the fact that the department needs to have a proper definition of what independence is before payments can be made on the basis of people being independent of their parents. The impression that the minister gave that students were receiving money on the basis of their marriage illustrates how faulty that definition was and how faulty the government's attitude is towards students in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government thought it could continue to whittle away the benefits of Austudy while increasing costs to students. The government has been found out. This was the straw that broke the camel's back and the student bodies persisted to resolve the matter. Thank goodness the Senate was able to coagulate the various forces and oppose this proposal successfully. Having opposed it and having forced the government to resolve the issue in a temporary sense, I hope the government has the capacity, with the help of its advisers and departments, to come up with a definition of an independent person. If that is finally resolved, then we will not be faced with this sort of nonsense in the future. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I can assure you the Government will now be redoubling its efforts to be as good a government as you hope and expect we can be . . . keeping those great nostrums of access and equity. Getting people into the game. The policies of inclusion.</PARA>
<PARA>He concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we won't let you down.</PARA>
<PARA>He had previously talked about being concerned about those who were unemployed and getting them back to work. They were the words of the Prime Minister in 1993 when the people of Australia re-elected this Labor government. You might have thought at that time that the people were being rewarded by his recognition of what was required at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to the comments of Chris Uhlmann in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on the by-election which was held in Canberra last Saturday. The by-election was for the seat of Canberra, caused by the resignation of the former member, Mrs Kelly. It was won convincingly and dramatically by the Liberal Party candidate, Mr Brendan Smyth, who will shortly take his place in the House of Representatives. Mr Acting Deputy President, I would love to read all of her article in case you have not read it, but I will keep to just a couple of bits. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Think of the major political stories being kicked around by Paul Keating in the past month and try to find one which addresses the concerns of the bulk of people who live in Tuggeranong, or the rest of the seat of Canberra, or any other middle-Australian area.</PARA>
<PARA>She continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP's recent approach to winning friends and influencing elections in this country is to split Australia into a nation of tribes and then try to buy off the bits.</PARA>
<PARA>They are very valid comments about what has occurred, and the vote of the people of Canberra endorses it. One of the things that we found when we were doorknocking and being amongst the electorate in recent weeks&mdash;and, in particular, this was reported to me by Brendan Smyth from the much more extensive doorknocking that he did&mdash;was that people commented time and time again on the Prime Minister's bad manners at home, in the parliament and, at that time, overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can recall what the Prime Minister has been indulging himself in: the unsubstantiated accusations of a deal in relation to media matters and, as far as Canberra is concerned, that absolutely dismissive comment of `So what?' when the Liberal Party won the ACT election. Senator McMullan tried to explain that away by saying, `Oh, no. He didn't mean, "So what?" He meant, "It's not really relevant because it was a local matter and not a federal matter."' But Mr Acting Deputy President, if you had heard it, you would have been left in absolutely no doubt whatever that the Prime Minister was saying to the people of Canberra, `So what? Who cares about you? I don't.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He pontificates about the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, and I am not suggesting that there is not some point in it. But he has raised all these diversions&mdash;the constitution, the flag and the things he talked about when he was overseas&mdash;ignoring completely the issues that are important to the people in the electorate of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are concerned about interest rates. They are having difficulty maintaining the mortgages on their homes. Families are still suffering and businesses, certainly, are still suffering from the recession that we had to have. People have not forgotten that. Mr Keating has created uncertainty about where interest rates will go from where they are at the present time. Mr Keating may not be aware of it but the ratio of family income paid towards mortgages and loan repayments went up in the December quarter to about 16 per cent, and people are hurting because of this. They know what is happening to them, even though the Prime Minister obviously does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are concerned about employment. There is very high youth unemployment in Canberra, and people wonder what will become of their children here. Youth unemployment is at 32.4 per cent, and it is a higher proportion for females than males. I could not tell the Senate how many children have had to leave Canberra, their home and their family earlier than they might otherwise have done in an attempt to obtain employment. These young people are leaving Canberra in an attempt to find work, especially after they have obtained tertiary qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 800,000 people unemployed nationally. The Labor Party keeps telling us that it has created 500,000 jobs recently. Senator Gareth Evans said that in answer to a question in the Senate only a couple of days ago, but fewer than half of these are real additions to the employment figures. We would like to know some more facts and figures about these alleged 500,000 new jobs. How many of them are permanent? What industries have provided the jobs? How many apprentices have been taken on and are being given the opportunity? There are many more things that one could go through when talking about the impact of unemployment on our society. For example, over 700,000 children live in households where there are parents without work. These are the things that people are concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are concerned about the standard of education for their families, the inadequate level of literacy and, more recently, the fees for tertiary students which we have heard about in the Senate. From 1994 postgraduate students have been forced to pay thousands of dollars for many courses after Labor decided to allow the universities to charge these fees. In the ACT a fee of $9,000 a year was being asked for a legal workshop. I have suggested that this is not even a postgraduate course; it is merely a year's course that turns the degree technically into a degree which would enable people to obtain employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few Australians, certainly students, will have forgotten the Prime Minister's comment just a week or so ago to students who were trying to get access to him&mdash;the access which was promised in March 1993&mdash;to talk about the problems and the difficulties they have with Labor's education policies. What did he say to them? He said, `Get a job.' Well, wouldn't they like to be able to get a job? People are encouraged to stay at school and go to university to get better qualifications, and this is what happens to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps a smaller, but growing, group of people who are concerned about what is happening to them are the self-funded retirees. Since the government introduced the Commonwealth senior's health card on 1 July 1994 for retired people who are not on a pension, an absolutely staggering 200,000 people have qualified for the card. That indicates that people who formerly were living on an income of about the same as a pension and getting absolutely no benefits were living in quite restricted conditions. We knew that, but it has taken a long time to get the additional card which has made such a difference for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1 July 1994, 200,000 people have qualified for this card. I believe that number will grow, because self-funded retirees are a significant part of our community. Their situation is not being looked at. These are the people who have saved and made a significant contribution towards their retirement, but they are not doing well in our society at the present time. Those figures really are quite dramatic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are concerned about superannuation. Government senators stand up in here and talk endlessly about their superannuation packages, but they have forgotten the casual and part-time workers. If people work for three months, the super levy is paid, but they get absolutely nothing from it by the time the funds take their fees out of it. I refer senators to speeches I have made previously in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> setting out the details of how little is left after these fees are paid and what a rip-off this is. The government has made absolutely no effort to put in place a super scheme which enables these people to receive some benefit. People are concerned about health, and why wouldn't they be? It was a big issue in the ACT election. Senator Minchin and Senator Patterson will deal with other matters in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No mention was made in the remarks of Senator Reid today about the result in New South Wales. On the predictions so far by the pundits, the Fahey government will go out of office by the end of this week or early next week. Of course even last Thursday and Friday the opinion polls of New South Wales understated the Labor vote first preference by some two to three per cent. It is quite clear that people give an indication in a public opinion poll as to whether they will vote a Labor government out or in but when they have to make that decision they are more likely to vote for a Labor government at the ballot-box than in an opinion poll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, whatever the difficulties about the by-election, when it comes to the crunch some time in the next 12 months, as happened leading up to the 1993 election, Labor will be voted back in. I remind senators opposite that there were plenty of times during 1992 when members opposite pointed out that Labor was 20 per cent behind the opposition in the opinion polls. When it came to the crunch, when people got to the ballot-box, they voted this government back. I believe that those on the other side who think it is an easy ride into government ought to remember what happened in 1987, 1990 and 1993. We do not take the electorate for granted as the opposition has in the past. That is why when it comes to the crunch people are willing to vote for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about the economy, which Senator Reid made some passing reference to. This economy is on a sustainable growth path. We have recorded 13 consecutive quarters of economic growth. The growth rate of the economy has exceeded one per cent in each of the last four quarters. The economy grew by 1.3 per cent in the September quarter and by 6.4 per cent through the year to the September quarter 1994. The economy grew by 4.2 per cent in 1993-94. Economic growth will be stronger in 1994-95 than in 1993-94. A recent business survey shows that the output growth remains strong in the December quarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business investment is growing strongly. The government's revised economic outlook is for growth in business investment of 24 per cent. What happened when we predicted 14 per cent in the budget last year? Everyone in the opposition pooh-poohed that figure. You said that 14 per cent was impossible to achieve. It is now 24 per cent. The total business investment in new assets grew by 5.7 per cent in the September quarter in 1994 and by 24.4 per cent in through the year terms. New investment in plant and equipment grew by 6.3 per cent in the September quarter and by 29.4 per cent in through the year terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, as well as having the economic runs on the board over the last 13 quarters, has demonstrated a clear commitment to combating inequality and alleviating poverty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That hopeless contribution by Senator Schacht, which did not address the matter of public importance, demonstrated very clearly for everyone to see exactly the point we are making in this matter of public importance debate, that is, that the Labor Party, represented by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), is continually failing to appreciate the needs and aspirations of mainstream Australia. That is exactly what Senator Schacht demonstrated today. At the end, he quoted one, two or three people selectively from some qualitative research. We could get just as many and more statements like that about the Prime Minister. You only have to read the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> today to see what Canberra people are saying about this Labor government and about this Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went on and on about growth, but he omitted to mention the things which Australians are concerned about; that is, three quarters of appalling and disastrous current account deficits. He omitted to remind the Australian public about the billions and billions&mdash;I think it is $160-odd billion&mdash;of foreign debt. It was $23 billion when this government came to power, now it is $160-odd billion. They are the things that are concerning Australians. The things that are concerning mainstream Australians are things like that and, in particular, the fact that their future and the future of their children and their grandchildren is being mortgaged by this government, which has no idea how to keep government spending under control and how to deal with issues like the foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in the same position we were in when Mr Keating said he was concerned we were going to be a banana republic, and we are going down the Mexican road. That is exactly what is happening. That is what mainstream Australians were saying to the Prime Minister at that election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said in the aftermath of the Canberra by-election as to why there was a 16-plus per cent swing against Labor in what was considered a relatively safe Labor seat. Why did 22,000 voters&mdash;22,000 people&mdash;who voted Labor last time, abandon the party this time? Why did they do it? You only had to listen to talkback radio on Monday, and you only had to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> to hear what the people of Canberra were saying. Over and over they were referring to the arrogance of this government and the arrogance, in particular, of this Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The once true believer who has now sold his soul for a few shekels of silver interpreted the by-election results as heralding a massacre for the federal government in the next federal election, and he said that the Prime Minister should apologise to the voters for what he has done to Australia. Will Mr Keating apologise? No. He says he has heard the message. It is like those people who sit and say, `I hear what you're saying,' but they are not actually hearing what you are saying at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating has learned nothing, and he continues to deflect responsibility to everything and everyone but himself. He is the problem. He is the problem because he has ignored the concerns of mainstream Australia; he is the problem because he has deceived mainstream Australians; and he is the problem because he has divided Australians. He has divided them on all sorts of issues such as the republic. But the worst division of all, the one for which he will go down in history, is the increased division between the rich and the poor. That is what he has done as Treasurer, and that is what he is continuing to do as Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have said through the Canberra voters that they are sick and tired of this government's arrogance, of the Prime Minister's political grandstanding while he is overseas and of his cynical manipulation of events to suit his own view of the world&mdash;and he reinvents history to suit his own view of the world. It is not just the people of Canberra, it is the university students, families and older Australians&mdash;in fact, everyone who is concerned about what is happening in Australia and to Australia. They are not very interested in what his views are about redesigning cities in Germany or wherever else he might happen to decide that he is going to grandstand&mdash;in Paris or Asia or wherever. Whatever they must have thought of him in Singapore when he stood there having a go at John Howard on the steps of Parliament House just makes the mind boggle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You only have to look at how Mr Keating and this government have ignored the needs and aspirations of older Australians to appreciate the magnitude of his arrogance and indifference. Seniors are not a group to be disregarded or patronised. They are an increasingly active, vocal and powerful group, and they are sick and tired of being overlooked and ignored. They are concerned about a whole range of issues and, principally, what they want is stability, financial and physical security, access to affordable and good quality health care, and confidence that they will be cared for if and when they can no longer look after themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Older Australians must be just staggered when they hear, as they have done, that nobody seems to be able to get access to Minister Lawrence. One of the Senate committees recently had a hearing on the health reforms, and group after group said that they had not been consulted. When you talk to the age care industry, the same message comes through. Older Australians must know that their views are not being represented to the minister because she, like her boss, does not want to listen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Older people are not just concerned about economic issues, they are also concerned about the value systems in our society and about social cohesion. Some of them must have been mortified&mdash;and that is the only word I can use&mdash;to read the guide to safe sex in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cleo</EMPHASIS> and that it was not a factual description of safe sex, but that it advocated a range of sexual behaviours that, in fact, one woman in her seventies told Senator Herron she had never known about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Older people are also concerned about the quality of life relating not just to economic wellbeing but also to levels of happiness, contentment and, as I said, social cohesion. They are concerned about falling living standards. They are concerned about unemployment. Unemployment affects many older people. Look what the government has had to do. It has had to bring in a mature age allowance because there are so many long-term unemployed in that senior category, that older group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Older people are concerned about retirement incomes, they are concerned about the health system, and they are concerned about community services. Minister Crowley today could not even answer a question as to whether the government was going to reduce HACC yet again, having done so in real terms three out of the last four years. These people are concerned about inflexibility in residential care and respite care for older people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are just a few examples of how the government and the Prime Minister have failed to appreciate the needs and aspirations of older Australians. They are also grandparents who care and are concerned about their children and their grandchildren not being able to find jobs and having to pay increased interest on their mortgages.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You ask them.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I meet with significant numbers of them. I had some in my office last week. I ask you: who dealt with the issue of putting aside sufficient income for people's retirement, given the range of problems we face with the aging population? Our government has dealt with that and Paul Keating was central to the development of that policy. Ours is the first government since 1949 to deal with the issue, and we have dealt with it in an effective way. I am not going to devote my contribution to the debate to the details of our superannuation policy, but by the year 2025 there will be sufficient savings via the superannuation policy, combined with the basic age pension, to provide a better average income than is currently provided through the age pension. We have done that. You can laugh and try to destroy that, as indeed your policy would do by freezing contributions, but that is an essential contribution to the wellbeing of the people of Australia and this Prime Minister has played an important role in that, particularly when he was Treasurer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention a couple of the economic issues. Senator Schacht concentrated on the impressive economic growth. There is also the issue of inflation. Until the last for our five years we were a high inflation country. Our underlying rate of inflation this year will be 2 to 2 1/4 per cent. That compares very well with other countries. It compares very well with the record over the previous 20 years. One of the monumental economic failures of the current opposition when it was in government, when John Howard was Treasurer, was its failure to tackle the issue of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interest rates are important from both the economic perspective and the perspective of housing purchase. Currently, interest rate bills are substantially lower than the average levels over the past 20 years. I know there is some concern in the community about this issue. People can remember when interest rates were touching 20 per cent four years ago and I think they fear that interest rates will move back to those levels. I believe very strongly that that is not going to occur, but I understand that people have that fear and that is an issue which we are in the process of dealing with by dealing with issues like our economic growth, the budget, the deficit&mdash;and how that unfolds we will see in May. But the issue of interest rates is very central to the concerns of Australians. It is one that the Prime Minister has acknowledged and holds uppermost in his mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> At the moment we are enjoying economic growth and job growth at an unprecedented level. There will be 300,000 new jobs this year. Our unemployment rate is expected to fall to 8.5 per cent by the June quarter of this year. This is a much better outcome than we forecast in last year's budget. The opposition pooh poohed and criticised the projections in last year's budget. Employment has risen by 4.4 per cent through the 12 months to February of this year. We have exceeded our commitment to job growth made at the last election. That is obviously an issue which has to be uppermost in the minds of mainstream Australia and again is an issue which the Prime Minister, in terms of developing policy as part of the government, is very concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other issues that we have tackled since we have been in government include health and the Medicare system. What is the opposition's solution to providing basic health care for all Australians? Again, it was this government that introduced Medicare. It was this Prime Minister as Treasurer who played a central role in the development of that policy. In respect of issues such as retirement incomes, carrying out an essential restructuring of the Australian economy, economic growth, inflation and health, the Prime Minister is very much in touch with the needs and aspirations of mainstream Australia. They are the basic fundamentals that everyone agrees need to be tackled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on one issue about which the Prime Minister is lambasted, and that is the theme that I mentioned when I began: pride in your own country. Our Prime Minister passionately believes that we should have an Australian as head of state of this country. He passionately believes that but most in the opposition apparently do not accept that as a theme. Well, fine, that is up to you. I know that everyone on our side is passionately devoted to that goal of the Prime Minister's. You can call it divisive if you like; we would call it effective leadership&mdash;making sure that the political institutions of this country reflect the modern needs of this country. The Prime Minister, I and all of us on this side of the chamber do not want to see the monarch of another country as the head of state of this country. The time for that has gone and the time for the development of an Australian head of state is here. You can resist that if you like. You can call it divisive and, by your definition, it is divisive, but we would call it effective leadership and making sure the political institutions of this country are indeed reflecting the times and the needs of our future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's devotion to improving and establishing our links with Asia through the APEC forum is often a hard issue for people in the community to understand and to accept. There has been, I think, always a latent concern about our relationships with Asia, for obvious historical reasons, particularly with a country like Japan but, again, it is an issue that has to be tackled and our Prime Minister is tackling it because it is essential for the future economic development of this country that we have very strong links with our Asian trading nations. Who would have believed 10 years ago that Korea was to overtake the United States as our major trading partner. Again the Prime Minister has spent enormous amounts of policy energy and time in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition can continue to abuse the Prime Minister personally&mdash;I think in many areas without justification. You swilled around in the so-called pig controversy when the Prime Minister had some investments in that area. You attack his personal interest in antique clocks and you continue to criticise him as a part-time prime minister because he turns up for two days in question time, but that will not do you any good at the end of the day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For 12 long, excruciating years Australians have been putting up with Labor's politics of interest groups. We have had 12 years of this government trying to buy off and politicise a whole variety of interest groups in Australia&mdash;whether it is ethnic groups, green groups, trade unionists, artists, whatever. Labour's whole approach to politics has been this approach of interest groups. But this playing off interest groups is finally catching up with the Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw it here earlier this year with the great confrontation between the greens and the forestry trade unionists which had Labor in its pincers, and we have really seen it come to the fore in the Canberra by-election where the politics of interest groups has really caught up with Labor. But the greatest problem for Labor and the greatest indictment of Labor over the last 12 years is that it has ignored the biggest interest group of all in Australia, and that is Australian families. They have been completely ignored by this government and that is the message out of Canberra. Fortunately, it appears from our point of view that Senator Sherry and Senator Schacht have missed the whole point of the Canberra by-election and that will lead to their defeat in a year's time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this issue of families, it is tragic that the government wasted the opportunity provided to it last year, which was the International Year of the Family. Most Australians would not know that now. It was a wasted opportunity. The Labor government could have put primacy upon Australian families and it did not. The year was wasted with debate about what a family was. The greatest achievement that the Labor Party can claim from last year is the use of the external affairs powers to override Tasmania's laws on homosexuality. That is the only thing we got from this government in the International Year of the Family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government had the Cass report, the national report from the Council for the International Year of the Family. That report came down late last year with some damning criticism of the government's family policy. We have seen nothing from the government yet, no government response to that. We know from that what priority this government places on families who are mainstream Australia but who are constantly ignored by this government. That is the real message of the Canberra by-election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happened to be the campaign director for the Adelaide and Port Adelaide by-elections which I thought showed significant swings and concerns among Australians about Labor, but I never expected anything like the Canberra by-election. That was a staggering swing, twice the size of the Adelaide by-election. It certainly means that those on the government benches opposite will soon be on this side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is ignoring what is a very deep, underlying concern in Australia; that is, the extent of and consequences flowing from family breakdown. There are enormous pressures on families in Australia today that the government seems to be incapable of recognising. Those concerns relate very much to taxes&mdash;the threat of higher taxes and the broken promises of this government on taxes. The Australian people feel conned by what happened in 1993. We have seen that in the results of the Canberra by-election. They are taking it out on the government because it conned them on taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people feel conned on interest rates. Those opposite promised to keep interest rates down. Just in the last six months the Australian people have seen interest rates rise three times. Interest rates now are costing Australian families $60 a month more because of the government's incompetent economic management. The Australian people are still very concerned about unemployment&mdash;eight per cent unemployment and much higher rates of youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is concern about not only the economic pressures on families but also what is occurring in Australian society. Divorce in Australia is now at a 10-year high. Family breakdown is costing Australians $3,000 million a year; there are over 45,000 children a year who are affected by it; and we have the highest youth suicide rate in the world. What more damning indictment can there be of this government's complete ignorance as to what is of most concern to mainstream Australia&mdash;and that is the position of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is simply not focusing on the things that really matter to ordinary, mainstream Australians&mdash;those things being family concerns. The government has no strategy for dealing with Australian families and their concerns; it is totally preoccupied with attacking us. It seems much more concerned with the coalition and John Howard than it is with ordinary Australians. It says to us here today that it wonders why we are so concerned with Keating. Our concern with Mr Keating is nothing compared to the government's utter preoccupation with our leader, John Howard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is running around the country, destroying our constitution and our freedom of speech, trying to create issues out of the flag and the Racial Hatred Bill. It is simply not dealing with the issues that matter to ordinary Australians. The government really seems to have lost its capacity to read the polls. I notice opposite a former state secretary from Western Australia, Senator Chris Evans. I am amazed at the way the government forgets the fact that the issues that rate in the polls are taxes, interest rates and unemployment. They are the issues that matter to Australians&mdash;not the republic, the flag or racial hatred. Those issues do not rate at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is suffering, I think, from the loss of Senator Richardson, and it will soon suffer from the loss of Senator Loosley. I think at least they knew what really mattered to ordinary Australians because at least they could understand opinion polls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is fundamentally anti-family. There is nothing in anything that this government has done for 12 years that we could really say points to this government being pro-family. There have been consistent attacks on family allowances. There has been a constant lowering of the means test on family allowances. We have seen from the leaked budget papers that there is a proposition to lower the means test for family allowance from $60,000 down to $35,000. What the government has done in relation to the home child-care allowance and the child-care cash rebate is nothing more than a flagrant attack on the position of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is providing incentives through the rebate system for women to enter the paid work force and place their children in child care; it is doing so in such a way as to grossly discriminate against women who sacrifice an income to care for their children at home. The government's whole policy is biased against women who sacrifice an income to care for their children at home. That was recognised in the Cass report. The Cass report, which the government has completely ignored, called for the amalgamation of those two payments because they are so discriminatory and because they are biased against ordinary Australian families and in favour of those who put their children in child care and go into the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Canberra by-election result was an extraordinary manifestation of the problems being experienced by ordinary Australian families, by mainstream Australians.

But it is interesting to note that the reasons the Liberal Party did so well in the Canberra by-election just happen to coincide with all the things that Senator Minchin has been talking about in the last few years. All the other opposition speakers have also found that the reasons the Liberal Party did so well in the Canberra by-election coincide with all those things that they have been pursuing for many years. After the Fremantle by-election when there was a one per cent swing to the Labor Party, I do not recall those opposite making the same speeches. But that is what political opportunism is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about today's motion is the reference to the aspirations of mainstream Australia. Here we go again: Johnny Howard's vision, the white picket fence, the little wife at home with a couple of kids, all wrapped up in the flag, talking about the queen and toasting the empire. That may be the view of mainstream Australia held by those opposite, but my view is that it is a much more multicultural and diverse society than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is about is trying to represent all Australians, taking up the issues of all Australians. When he talks about Mabo and native title, he is taking up the needs and aspirations of Aboriginal Australians. When he is talking about the Racial Hatred Bill, he is taking up concerns raised by multicultural Australians or Australians of non-English speaking background. When we take up some of these other issues that so divide and cause so many problems for the Liberal Party, we are taking up the issues of all Australians&mdash;rather than promoting this view of Australia as being some sort of homogeneous group of people, all having some sort of single view of the world. I think this really reflects the Liberal Party's longing for some past Australian society, which I do not think ever really existed, but that is for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, the fact that I felt quite shaken by the Canberra result&mdash;like most Labor members should&mdash;I found quite beneficial. I am very keen to examine the reasons why the Labor Party did so poorly. But, unlike some of my colleagues on the other side of the chamber and some of my own colleagues, I intend to give it a bit more of a professional and scientific analysis than a merely knee-jerk reaction and the use of one's own prejudices to try to interpret the result. And I am sure Senator Minchin will be giving it a much more professional examination than one would suspect from his contribution today. I hope that some of my colleagues do also, because there is a message in there for the Labor Party. It is important that we understand and hear that message. I do not agree with Mr Downer's analysis of the importance of the result. However, I think it is important that the Labor Party listens to that result. I am sure we will, and I think the Prime Minister has indicated that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, though, while we are on the question of weekend election results, I think it is important to point out that the New South Wales people are also part of mainstream Australia. The millions of people who voted in New South Wales in the election on Saturday also expressed a view. While I regard the Canberra by-election as very important, I also regard the result in New South Wales as very important.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the second part of a report by the Australian National Audit Office into the accommodation of Defence Force personnel. The Senate looked at the first part of the report some time ago. This report today relates to the accommodation of people, including single people without family, living in Defence barracks. It is interesting to note that the proportion of members who are required to live in for operational or other reasons represents about 25 per cent of all members without families. Many members choose to live off-base if they can, but usually they are required to obtain the consent of their CO if they are to be eligible for living out allowances. Often people who are living out of barracks are doing so totally at their own expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to the Defence Force that certain personnel live in barracks, especially young or new recruits who need to develop an esprit de corps, et cetera. Often, as people get older, it is less appropriate and less necessary for them to live in barracks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community attitudes towards living standards have changed considerably in the last few years. The lack of privacy associated with living in barracks needs to be contended with by the Defence Force. There is a need for privacy; there is a need for more space. I am sad to find that over the past 10 years there have been recommendations in these areas, yet little or nothing has been done about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad that this report was needed at all. As I say, reports in this area have been presented to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), yet little or no action has been taken in relation to accommodation for members without families. Having said that, I recognise that money has been spent on upgrading existing accommodation, but the scales and standards still have not been changed and there is still a lack of privacy. The Auditor-General has been fairly critical of the failure of the department to respond to previous reviews. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report contains recommendations which propose that the separation of food and accommodation charges is an essential step in the process of resolving inequities between members. Members with families are treated in a different way from those without families, and it is to the detriment of those with families. There were reviews in 1982 and there were two reviews in 1991. There has been deferral of some action until there is an outcome of a fundamental review of personnel policy. That is not due for completion until the middle of this year. Consultants have been engaged to consider payment of a cash subsidy as an option to the provision of accommodation. The audit office is concerned that, despite a series of reviews, as I have said, inequities and financial disabilities associated with accommodation assistance for ADF members have been allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office has recommended that Defence take action to consider all outstanding matters relating to ADF accommodation, removal and relocation conditions. I add my voice to the Auditor-General. It is totally unsatisfactory that recommendation after recommendation has gone to government for more than 10 years and we still have the same recommendations being made in 1995 by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office noted that the existing arrangements had resulted in some dissatisfaction among members. As I have mentioned, there is a lack of privacy and loss of social freedom in on-base accommodation. A measure of the level of dissatisfaction is that some 35 per cent of people married without families are choosing to live off-base without financial assistance. I mentioned the recent upgrading program, but a significant proportion of the accommodation still does not meet the service's own scales and standards, and those scales and standards are out of date in terms of space available per person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office considers that Defence may need to give further consideration to the standard of accommodation provided for these personnel in order to improve the equity between ADF members. Currently, there is no centralised record of the level of accommodation utilisation or of the availability of suitable accommodation. There is little information available relating to the variation in the quality of the accommodation. Accurate and complete accommodation  records are essential for planning and costing purposes and for other purposes as well. The audit office has recommended that guidelines be developed for the classification of accommodation and that a survey of the standard of the existing accommodation be conducted and incorporated into a central database. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have here a report of the Inspector-General's Division of the Department of Defence of January 1991. Some of the recommendations contained in this report are just the same as those that are being given today. I draw attention to the recommendation in the 1991 report that a recognition of the appropriateness of different types of accommodation must be accompanied by a recognition of the negative impact on moral and hence operational effectiveness of poor standard accommodation. The 1991 report also notes that to determine living in accommodation requirements accurate information is required on patterns of utilisation. The evaluation team found that planning was often not based on accurate information or verifiable assumptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four years later the Auditor-General is saying the same thing. The inquiry in 1991 said that there was a lack of systems in place to effectively record the real cost of the accommodation. Similarly, there was no system in place to enable coordination of accommodation booking within services or between services. The report also noted that the space entitlements for members in this sort of accommodation needed to be increased. The team also found that reliable data on the real costs of providing accommodation, particularly the individual establishments, were not generally available and this deficiency was due to a combination of dispersed authority and responsibility for those costs and a lack of suitable systems for control of the costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could continue reading the recommendations contained in the 1991 report from the Inspector-General which are almost word for word those contained in today's report from the Auditor-General. Suffice to summarise, I say that nothing seems to have been done. With 108,081 people employed in the Defence function by the taxpayers of Australia, how is it that nobody seems to have been made available to do something about the living in accommodation of Defence Force personnel? Why is it that in running a major department of state worth billions of dollars that department cannot spare anybody out of that 108,000 people to get proper databases and information systems in place and to cost and value the assets, their maintenance and their use? I think it is a scandal. What are these 108,081 people doing? Fighting the battle of Russell Hill? I cannot see that we are going to get very far with them in light of their lack of progress to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We constantly find the Auditor-General coming before us saying, `We've made recommendations to Defence and they haven't been implemented.' It is not good enough. If Defence had a real limitation on the number of public servants and restrictions on the information systems that it has been able to introduce, for example, then perhaps we could understand. But Defence has been spending millions of dollars on information systems over the last five or six years. It has 108,000 people available for the Defence function. Surely, some of these people and these resources could have been put to work to make sure that it was running as an efficient organisation in terms of its management of its assets and its provision of quality accommodation for its personnel. If we are not able to provide good quality accommodation for those who for one reason or another must live in, then we do not deserve to have people whom we have spent a lot of money on in respect of training wanting to stay in the Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the interests of the nation that we do not lose people prematurely after we have invested so much in their training. One day&mdash;God forbid&mdash;we may need every one of these people that we have invested so heavily in. We do not want to find that they have been dispersed to the four winds and their skills have become rusty for the lack of concern about the quality of their accommodation. How many of us in this place would want to live in some of the barrack accommodation that is available to our defence personnel around Australia? While I recognise that some of the accommodation has been upgraded, most of us would consider it was accommodation of the 1960s and the 1970s, not the 1990s. </PARA>

<PARA>I am pleased to table part 2 of this report of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee on the development of open learning in Australia. This is the first report that we have tabled since the death of our deputy chair, former Senator Olive Zakharov. Olive Zakharov made a substantial contribution to this inquiry, and she had, of course, a very strong professional interest in education matters as a former teacher and school counsellor. Senator Zakharov attended all the public hearings and meetings of the committee during the inquiry and the committee wishes to place on record its appreciation of her contribution to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In part 1 of the report, which we tabled in December 1994, the committee looked at the role played in open learning by the Open Learning Agency of Australia, the Open Learning Technology Corporation and the Open Learning Electronic Service, which has now become known as Open Net. The committee report at this time was highly critical of the establishment, structure and operation of the OLAA, after hearing evidence from a very wide range of stakeholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's main recommendations in part 1 are that the government enter negotiations with Monash University and the AVCC with a view to placing the Open Learning</PARA>
<PARA>Agency of Australia under the auspices of the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee and that the government provide funds equivalent to 50 per cent of the EFTSU for students entering the system through the Open Learning Agency. We urge the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee, which is still considering these recommendations, to accept them so that the work of the Open Learning Agency can be placed on a proper national footing inclusive of all universities and so that the sector can be better placed and properly funded to enter the international marketplace, where quality must be assured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In part 2 of the report, which I am tabling today, the committee has looked more broadly at the many exciting facets of open learning as they unfold in this country. The committee was very impressed with the many fine examples of open learning practice which are encountered in a whole range of areas, particularly in higher education and the TAFE system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Universities, in particular those that have had a tradition of offering distance education, are at the forefront of the developments in open learning in Australia. The former distance education centres, or DECs, as they are known, are playing a major role in providing the infrastructure and the expertise necessary to develop open learning courses and to assist students who enrol in these courses. In 1994, there were around 69,000 distant education enrolments in universities, mostly in the DECs, with around 5,000 students registered through the OLAA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A concern which emerged during the inquiry was that there seemed to be no coordination of the various open learning programs currently offered at different levels in our education system. Accordingly, the committee has recommended to the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs the establishment of a forum representative of the key education and training interest groups to develop a blueprint for the implementation of open learning across schools, vocational education and training and the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major outcomes of the present lack of coordination was the problem that it creates for students who are seeking credit transfer between institutions and levels of education. At present, students who are unable, for various reasons, to obtain credit for courses already completed use public funds to repeat these courses. Institutions have found that assessment of prior learning can be difficult and expensive and are often reluctant to engage in it. This process is extremely wasteful. My own daughter was caught up with this when she transferred between universities doing a Bachelor of Business course. Going from one university to another, the courses did not exactly match. She had done in a previous course twice as much commercial law as she needed to do for the new university, so it was not going to count half the law she did. This sort of silly anomaly has to go. If students, particularly in what is called a unified national system, have completed one-third of a degree in a university, they should get recognition for one-third of the degree when they move to another institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Credit transfer arrangements, which the government is now trumpeting as being one of its great triumphs, I have discovered from personal interest to be very much in their infancy. I would urge the government to move on in this area as fast as it can. It is very wasteful not to do so, because what you are doing really is requiring students to repeat credit points that they have already done. This takes up resources, staffing, and library and building space at a university, so it is totally counterproductive. The committee is pleased to see that the government and the AVCC came to an agreement on 14 February to establish, on a pilot basis, a national credit transfer agency; and the permanent agency will be established later this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Open learning is used extensively also in vocational education and training and, in particular, by the TAFE institutions who wish to reach students around Australia who otherwise would not be able to complete the courses that are offered. TAFE prefers to use the term `flexible delivery' rather than `open learning'; and we did discover, as we moved around Australia, that some of the most innovative approaches to open learning came from the TAFE sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also in this area a number of companies which are encouraging their employees to undertake courses through open learning; and the committee learned of several Australian companies that have entered into arrangements with both university and TAFE sectors to provide courses tailored to their needs. I have certainly seen this on the north coast of New South Wales at Southern Cross University, which has developed a range of courses, from certificate right through to PhD, that are tailored to the needs of private and public companies. That development is most welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also, at another level, a great development in open learning in the high schools of New South Wales. But one fears that the cost of infrastructure to do it properly in this new technological age will put a brake on schools' participation. To overcome the disadvantage of schools that cannot afford to have access to open learning networks, the committee has recommended that the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs develop a joint Commonwealth-state funding proposal to establish a base level of telecommunications and computing infrastructure in the schools by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This I have seen develop overseas, and states like North Carolina are moving very quickly towards all public infrastructure, including all schools being linked to the information superhighway. The adult and community education sector is another group which fears that it will not be able to participate properly in open learning because of its inability to meet the high cost involved in the acquisition of computer equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We met with that group today. Since our report on adult and community education there has been some landmark changes in this sector. We urge the government not to rest on its laurels but to provide further material and further resources so that that group can have proper access to open learning, particularly with new technology. Equity and access is heavily dependent on facilitating access to such groups by opening existing school facilities after hours, for example. We need that sort of flexibility in the system so that adult and community education can fully develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of open learning has resulted in a blurring of the lines and increasing pressure on facilities and resources, particularly in the TAFE sectors and in relation to public libraries. The pressure is often coming from students enrolled with institutions other than those from which they seek assistance. It is important that appropriate funding arrangements be put in place to ensure that all open learning students have access to the learning materials and support they need for the successful completion of the courses in which they are enrolled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry the committee visited educational centres in every state of the nation as well as the Northern Territory. An Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory provided an excellent example of the use of the open learning technique through the Tanami network. The community uses the network to overcome some of the disadvantages imposed on its students by distance and the lack of support systems for those who choose to move to a major centre to study. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the success of these students is heavily dependent on the availability of an on-site tutor who takes them through the work and enables them to work at their own pace. There is some anxiety regarding the continuation of funding for this on-site tutor. The committee recommends that DEET continue this funding and recommends the extension and development of the Tanami network to support open learning initiatives for Aboriginal students in remote communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a recognition amongst the many players in open learning that it could also provide opportunities for further export of education. If those opportunities are to be fully exploited, greater attention will have to be paid to the important issue of courseware development for open learning in the vocational education and training sector in particular in order to meet the requirements for overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OLTC, which is the Open Learning Technology Corporation, and the Australian Committee for Training Curriculum both have a role to play in advising the ministerial council on the development of a coherent approach to the funding and coordination of courseware development, not just for this country but for the export potential in overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is of the view that open learning entails a paradigm shift in the way in which we provide education and training to meet the technical and intellectual requirements of the future and in particular to serve the concept of learning as a lifelong activity. The way in which we have done things so far and the conceptual and structural boundaries that surround them are profoundly challenged by and indeed often antagonistic to open learning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traditional institutions, teacher training, administrative structures and policies designed for semester-bound courses and campus-bound students must be all transformed into concepts and structures which make sense in the new open learning environment. Such a transformation requires imagination as much as it requires rigorous thinking. A considerable amount of imagination and rigour is already evident throughout the country in the open learning areas. Schools, universities, TAFE colleges and industry training agencies are using open learning approaches that make changes in their effectiveness and in the quality and accessibility of services that they provide to students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, to bring about these changes in favour of open learning at the level of systems, we must bring about major changes in the way in which we measure training effort and also in the way we fund those systems, including how we provide income support for students. The committee has therefore recommended that the Commonwealth undertake a review of the funding of student financial support with a view to accommodating the wide range of study patterns now available to students, particularly as a result of open learning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of training and support for teachers who are new to open learning approaches needs also to be addressed. There are important industrial relations implications here. We have to change the support and reward systems for teachers if we are to carry through the logic of a student-centred rather than a teacher-centred or institution-centred approach to learning. If we do not make the change, we will greatly diminish the potential of open learning to help students from all walks of life and with very diverse needs to meet their education and training goals. I am confident that the work of the committee and its report on open learning will help to bring about these changes. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report of the Australian Land Transport Development Program for 1993-94&mdash;almost another financial year has gone&mdash;shows that for national arterials Western Australia was allocated $22 million for works from 1 July 1993 to 31 December 1993 and a further $22 million from 1 January 1994 to 30 June 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report also states that 29 kilometres of the Kalgoorlie-Meekatharra-Pilbara highway was sealed. To anyone looking at this report, on the surface that may seem a great distance, but when looking at it in the context of the massive distances to be covered in those areas, it is very minimal. How totally inadequate that road is was borne out by the floods we had recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the Goldfields, Pilbara and Midwest highway, as it is commonly known, you can go from eastern Australia to Kalgoorlie and head up towards the Pilbara, but at the same time you may be able to go to the western region of Geraldton. There is a big debate about which route that should take&mdash;whether it should go up to Wiluna, across to Meekatharra and up to the Pilbara, whether it should go from Leinster over to Mt Magnet and then to the Pilbara or to Geraldton, or whether it should go from Goldfields up to Wiluna and then up to Three Rivers station, Meekatharra and so forth. There is so much debate amongst the locals about which way that should go that I will leave it to them to finally work that out. The main point I make is that the funding that has been given to them is totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report says that an extension of the Reid Highway was completed in that year, at a cost of $29 million, and also that $24 million was spent for 3 1/2 kilometres of Roe Highway, to take that over to Welshpool. Of course, that is a welcome extension and we look forward to that sort of highway system around Perth continuing and finally being finished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also mentioned the 12 kilometre extension of the Kwinana Freeway for $36 million. The report says&mdash;this amazes me&mdash;that the extension of the Kwinana Freeway a further 12 kilometres between Forest Road and Thomas Road at a cost of $36 million completes construction of the entire Kwinana Freeway from Perth to Rockingham. It was my understanding&mdash;I presume it was the understanding of all Western Australian members and senators&mdash;that that freeway would be finished down by Rockingham and not by going down to Forest Road and having to do a hard right over to the highway that goes down through to Rockingham at present. I hope what is in the report is a mistake, because it would be ridiculous if that program was not finished and did not extend the bottom of the freeway in the proper way to take it right through to Kwinana. I look forward to the day this government makes the sort of money available that will enable that to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put on record the dismay of Western Australia at the lack of road funding it gets from this federal government. I have said before and I will say again that in 1994, $760 million was raised in fuel levies in Western Australia and only $150 million went back to that state. In 1995, $1 billion in fuel levies will be raised from Western Australia and only $150 million will go back there. This shows a total disregard for the state that supplies 25 per cent of Australia's export income and it is time this government addressed that situation. Otherwise, it will have to be addressed when the Howard government comes into action. </PARA>

<PARA>In this parliament we are used to some pretty robust exchanges and some fairly crude use from time to time of the protections afforded by parliamentary privilege. There is a tradition of fairly high levels of tolerance for privacy invading and confidentiality invading behaviour which might otherwise be extremely questionable. These occasions often generate some heated parliamentary debate. Certainly, I have directed quite a lot of fire at Senator Baume in this respect in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes a piece of parliamentary behaviour, or misbehaviour, under cover of privilege is so crude and so extreme that if the parliament is to retain any self-respect and any community respect as an institution, it just has to take some strong action. Such was the case last Thursday night when Senator Baume tabled copies of documents from the Australian Taxation Office setting out details of adjustments made and the tax payable by Dr Peter Macdonald, the independent candidate for Manly in the New South Wales election, for the period 1984 to 1989, which documents included Dr Macdonald's tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had it occurred outside the parliament, Senator Baume's behaviour in publishing this material, in particular the tax file number, would have been criminally punishable. The Taxation Administration Act 1953 makes it an offence punishable by two years imprisonment or a fine of up to $10,000, or both, for the unauthorised disclosure of a person's tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume's only stated purpose in doing what he did last Thursday night was to impugn the integrity of Dr Macdonald as the independent candidate for Manly, to secure political advantage. As he said himself:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Dr Macdonald's own taxation record shows a lack of integrity that must be of major concern to his constituents in Manly.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Baume claimed at the time that he was only pre-empting an exercise by Dr Macdonald's own supporters, as he said, `dropping what is known as a bucket on the Liberal candidate for Manly at the last minute in the campaign for the state election, so denying Mr Oldfield the opportunity of an effective response.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention to embark on this course of behaviour is what Senator Baume is attributing to the other side.

Don't let's have any moral indignation from you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume's actions were not only not encouraged or endorsed, it seems, by the New South Wales Liberal government, but also generated an immediate reaction from the Premier, Mr Fahey, who immediately dissociated himself from Senator Baume's actions. He said, quoting from various interviews:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had no knowledge of the matter going to be raised.</PARA>
<PARA>To quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not play politics that way now or ever. . . I never would play politics that way.</PARA>
<PARA>Whether Mr Fahey or any other senior members of the Liberal establishment did know about this exercise of Senator Baume is something that is challenged by Dr Macdonald. I do not know who is right in this respect. I do not know who knew what. I certainly know that it is on the public record that Mr Fahey has dissociated himself on the strongest possible terms from Senator Baume's behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other statements reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 25 March, Mr Fahey says that he had given a personal undertaking to Dr Macdonald not to raise the tax issue, the details of which he had known previously about. The truth of the matter appears clearly to be, as Mr Fahey apparently acknowledged, that Dr Macdonald's understatement of his income was the product of an error made by his former accountant and that back taxes had been paid immediately that error had been sorted out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the result, Senator Baume did exactly what he had falsely accused Dr Macdonald's supporters of being about to do. Namely, he raised an apparently very damaging issue at the last possible moment, cynically timing it for maximum effect and maximum exposure, leaving his victim with little or no opportunity&mdash;remarkably little opportunity, 24 hours&mdash;in which to explain to the electorate the precise circumstances of the adjustment to his tax liability. With the result of this seat apparently still swinging on a handful of votes, it has to be acknowledged that every possibility remains that Senator Baume's dirty trick will have its intended effect: swaying maybe enough votes to make a difference to the outcome of the seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alan Ramsey, who does not pull his punches on these occasions, I think put it very succinctly in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 25 March. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was a brutal hatchet job on an opponent given no chance to defend himself. His accuser attacked in the dark, under parliamentary privilege, at the last possible moment, from 300 kilometres away. Macdonald campaigning on home ground in Manly knew nothing of what Baume had done until much later. Only the next morning did he get an equal chance to strike back.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was cowardly, sleazy and more than likely self-defeating.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope it was self-defeating; as I have just said, that remains very much to be seen. It has been suggested by Senator Baume, in his brief response yesterday in this place, that he is somehow immunised from blame or censure in this matter because he was given leave to do what he did by the duty minister and by the handful of senators present in the chamber at the time of that adjournment debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be appreciated that Senator Baume gave no indication whatsoever that the document contained a tax file number. It certainly was not immediately apparent, with the kind of scrutiny that documents sought to be tabled are usually given by duty ministers, that the `file number' referred to in one of the documents was the individual's tax file number. As such, it was an extremely sensitive piece of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume's preceding comments in the Senate before he tabled the documents certainly gave no indication of their content. He simply said words to this effect:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Macdonald's own taxation record shows a lack of integrity . . . I have evidence which I now seek leave to table.</PARA>
<PARA>To take the point now of leave being given, as Senator Baume wants us to do and to attach significance to, is to fail to acknowledge that the courtesies of this place have usually meant that leave is given for request to table documents without much detailed scrutiny or questioning. For Senator Baume to take advantage of that situation in the circumstances of this case is not to take a very elevated position and not to take a position which in any way detracts from his moral liability in this particular instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has to now expect that practice to change, so far as scrutiny of documents is concerned. I will be advising members of the government front bench in future to inquire very carefully as to the status of each document for which leave to table is sought. You have got to expect people to be asking you, `Is this document defamatory?', and, `Is it likely to be taken as such?' You have got to expect people to ask you in a further dimension&mdash;whether or not you answer it honestly is up to you&mdash;`Is a breach of the criminal law involved in this tabling of a document, or would it be if it were outside this parliament?'</PARA>

In this case, there is no doubt whatsoever&mdash;we do not need the Solicitor-General's advice to tell us this&mdash;that the Taxation Administration Act does prohibit the disclosure of exactly the information that Senator Baume provided. Had the transaction occurred outside the cover of privilege in this parliament, it would be criminally punishable. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howard's repeated endorsement of Mr Ian McLachlan on his `honourable behaviour' over the Hindmarsh documents affair shows that he is simply no longer concerned, if he was ever concerned, about flagrant abuse of privacy and flagrant abuse of confidentiality. By his silence on the present occasion, he will stand condemned. If he does not want to stand condemned, let him answer the questions. Does he think that Senator Baume's actions on Thursday night were honest, decent and principled? Let him answer that question. When did Mr Howard, and Senator Hill for that matter, approve the tactic of tabling the taxation material on Dr Macdonald? Did they approve it? Would they like to answer that? Were they proud of the event that took place? Do they approve it now in retrospect? If they did not approve it, when did Mr Howard, and Senator Hill, move to censure Senator Baume privately for his disgraceful actions? When are they going to do it publicly? By their silence, they will stand condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question now is: what can the Senate do about the situation with which we are confronted by Senator Baume's behaviour? There is no doubt that Senator Baume, whether he deserves to be or not, is protected by parliamentary privilege from criminal or civil action against him in relation to the documents he tabled.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Baume's actions clearly demand, against that background and against the inadequacy of that other remedy, is the censure of this Senate in the strongest possible terms. The motion before the House does just that. Paragraph (b) of it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)censures Senator Baume for:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i)his commission of an act, the disclosure of Dr Macdonald's tax file number, which would have been a crime if done outside the Parliament, and</PARA>

<PARA>I emphasise the point that his disregard was on that basis rather than for any larger public interest. What conceivable larger public interest can be claimed in this case? Senator Baume frankly acknowledged that he was about undermining the integrity of this individual. It was a blatant, straightforward attack of that kind. He deserves stronger censure for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation also clearly demands that Senator Baume apologise to Dr Macdonald and the Senate for his behaviour. The motion also demands that. We can consider at a later stage appropriate redress against him if he fails to make those apologies in the light of this motion's passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the situation also raises the larger question of other possible sanctions against Senator Baume. There was a time in the past when the commission in this place of what would otherwise be a criminal act, were it not protected by privilege, by a member or senator was nonetheless treated as a contempt of parliament that could justify the expulsion of the member or senator concerned. That was essentially the response made by the House of Representatives in the Mahon case in 1920. There was a lot of argument in the Mahon case about whether a real criminal offence was notionally committed or whether it was a defensible exercise of the right of free speech in the circumstances of that case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a situation whereby the 1987 Parliamentary Privileges Act has not only removed the power to expel, which in the past was treated as an appropriate response to someone who did engage in gross, outrageous and criminal behaviour in the parliament, but also redefined elements of the offence of contempt. If I could find section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, I would read it into the record. I will have to come back to it. Section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act makes it clear that someone can only be subject to proceedings in the House under the Senate's power to proceed for contempt. I am paraphrasing, because I do not have the text of section 4 in front of me. This occurs in circumstances where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate, its committees and senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them from the performance of their functions. That is the essence of section 4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is whether a case can be made that Senator Baume's conduct amounts to a contempt of the Senate within the meaning of section 4. Paragraph (d) of the motion before us outlines the nature of that case. It draws attention to the fact that Senator Baume incompletely informed the Senate as to the nature of the documents and, in particular, did not inform the Senate that it contained the tax file number of a person. Moreover, in doing so, he caused an injustice to a citizen to arise in the course of proceedings in the Senate without the Senate being aware of that consequence, which thereby impeded the Senate in the free exercise of its functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That point is arguable. Under the circumstances, and given the time that is available, I do not think it is necessary to further pursue the nature of that argument at this stage. It is an argument, however, that should be looked at very carefully by the privileges committee. It is entirely appropriate that the Standing Committee on Privileges be given a reference in order to enable the full character of section 4, in its present language, to be explored. But in the event that the privileges committee should come to the conclusion that Senator Baume's conduct, however disgraceful, is nonetheless not a contempt within the meaning of section 4, as it is presently set out, the motion asks the committee to consider whether or not such action should be able to be treated as a contempt with some appropriate amendment of the legislation necessary to accommodate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic point comes down to this: this is a case in which a very strong response is required by this Senate, irrespective of whatever our party affiliations or whatever our views of the course of conduct undertaken by Senator Baume on other matters in the past may be. This case should be looked at entirely on its own terms. It is a situation where, to again use the words of Mr Howard on 23 February 1988, in relation to something much less specifically focused and not aimed at any individual, we have a senator who has acted `deliberately, not accidentally, and cold-bloodedly, not inadvertently'. I repeat, to use Mr Howard's words of 1988, that Senator Baume has acted `deliberately, not inadvertently, and cold-bloodedly, not inadvertently'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that Senator Baume's behaviour, both in putting on the public record a tax file number&mdash;which to do so in any context other than a parliamentary one is a criminal offence punishable by a very substantial fine or term of imprisonment&mdash;and in putting on the record material deliberately and directly designed to impugn the integrity of an individual who is unable to effectively answer back, for straightforward crass political motives and uncoloured by any larger question of public interest, amounts to one of the most extreme and gross breaches of any residual parliamentary code of decency that might be thought to exist in this place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A motion to censure a member of the Senate is one of the most serious that can come before the Senate. It should not be a political stunt or some kind of political get square, it must rest on principle. If that is the case, then Senator Gareth Evans's appalling, inept speech tonight certainly demonstrates that it does not rest on principle and that, in fact, it rests on next to nothing. Senator Evans's speech not only lacked substance but also lacked competence and integrity. I do not know what Senator Evans was really on about and I am certain that those who heard his speech would be astounded that this is a man who has pretensions to becoming a High Court judge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to deal shortly with the very serious matters that are nonetheless contained in the motion. Firstly, I want to demonstrate that this motion does not merit support not only because the punishment that Senator Evans wishes to impose on me does not fit the so-called crime, but also because of the disgraceful nature of the detail of the motion created by a putative High Court judge, Senator Evans, whose performance has been disgraceful. I think his speech tonight provides one of the most dramatic demonstrations of why he should not be allowed near that court let alone in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion was conceived in malice, born in deceit and swaddled in falsehood. Tonight Senator Evans gave an appalling speech that effectively abandoned his baby. This motion emerges from Senator Evans's humiliation last week when he had to correct his misleading understatements about the nature of the New South Wales Labor Party's huge debt. Senator Evans hates being wrong and he particularly hates being wrong when I have proved that he is wrong and I am right. I put it to the Senate that this motion is an offensive get square because Senator Evans made a fool of himself last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this does not diminish in any way the need to put some matters right that were, quite frankly, wrong when I tabled this an accurate, totally correct and undisputedly true document relating to Dr Peter Macdonald who had understated his income for tax purposes. So putting Senator Evans's silly and self-serving motion to one side, I today wrote to Dr Macdonald in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Dr Macdonald,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have noted your concern that your Tax File Number was inadvertently tabled by me along with documents revealing that your income was understated by $104,000. I would like you to know that immediately it was drawn to my attention that your TFN was on the document, I requested that it be excised and this was done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The three journalists who received copies of the tabled documents assured me, on my request, that they would excise it from their copy. The only other recipients of the tabled document, according to the Senate Table Office, were two Labor Senators and I asked the Table Office to contact them in similar terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To my knowledge, no-one now has a copy of your Tax File Number as a result of my tabling the document, unless they received it from the two Labor Senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event that any copies of the tabled letter containing your TFN have been circulated, then I apologise that my action has inadvertently provided an opportunity for someone other than myself, and despite my best endeavours, to breach the confidence of your TFN.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you feel that you now have a problem with your existing TFN, then I understand that this matter can be immediately resolved by your requesting a new TFN from the Tax Department.</PARA>
<PARA>I note that Senator Evans, having come in here and incompetently and defensively attacked me and my motives, is not here to hear my response. I must say that that does not surprise me. That is the sort of behaviour one would expect from Senator Evans and from the party he leads in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is distressing to me that Dr Peter Macdonald's tax file number was inadvertently on the document that I tabled in the Senate on Thursday night.

After being advised that the clerk's approval was needed to do so, I immediately sought that approval by writing to the clerk on the nearest scrap of paper available to me in the committee room where I was attending an estimates hearing&mdash;so urgent did I regard the task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Immediately after receiving the clerk's advice that the tax file number would be excised, I telephoned the three journalists who, to the combined knowledge of the Table Office and myself, had received the tabled document and I asked them to excise the tax file number. Each assured me that they did so. That did not stop one of them, I regret to say, referring to the tax file number being tabled in the parliament without bothering to mention what I had done subsequently to get that number excised. I guess journalistic ethics have changed since I was a journalist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did what I could to ensure that Dr Macdonald's tax file number was protected from becoming public knowledge as a result of my inadvertent tabling of it.

I am unaware that anyone else now knows Dr Macdonald's tax file number because of my action. However, I understand&mdash;as does Dr Macdonald from his published comments&mdash;that many copies of this correspondence have been circulated in Sydney in recent months.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever I make an allegation backed by an Australian Securities Commission document Senator Evans says it is unsubstantiated muckraking. When I provide land titles documents it is unsubstantiated muckraking. I have been right all the time. The only documents ever presented to this parliament on matters that I have raised here are those that demonstrate I am right. When Senator Evans gets up and continues the charade that I am continually wrong, he never provides one shred of evidence, not one document, not one thing that any chamber could possibly believe, given Senator Evans's and his party's record of misleading this chamber on every one of the matters of substance and fact that I have presented here, particularly, I might say, the matters of fact about the breaches of the companies law by Mr Paul Keating's half owned piggery group at the time he was its half owner. There has not been one shred of evidence in response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the only reason I tabled this document was to counter the false allegation that it would be unsubstantiated. In tabling the document my one motivation was to establish the accuracy of my statement that Dr Macdonald had understated his taxable income. Senator Evans apparently knows my motivations; he has said in this motion that I was motivated by various things and that this was my intention. What a disgrace! He would not know a decent intention if he fell across one. It is highly offensive for Senator Evans to impute such disgraceful motives as he has in his notice of motion with no evidence whatsoever to support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have, as I said, offered Dr Macdonald an apology in the terms that I read out. If Senator Evans's motion was passed in its present form, it would involve imputations against me which are demonstrably false for which there is no evidence and which represent a denial of natural justice to me. In fact, the evidence indicates the error was inadvertent and that everything possible was done to correct it. I do believe that Senator Evans may be motivated in this matter by malice and that this motion represents an attempt to punish me for my accurate attacks on the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party in particular. This does not seem to me to be a sound ground on which to base the very serious step of censuring a senator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the real objection by Senator Evans to what I did? Is he objecting to the truth? In other words, is he objecting to the fact that I revealed what had in the past always been revealed in the tax commission's annual report; that is, tax defaulters? I repeat, that was removed by this government. Is it an objection to my revealing the truth? I must say that if the truth hurts the only people at risk of being hurt are those with something to hide. Dr Macdonald hid his understating of taxable income for three years after he became a state member of parliament before confessing to the Premier and asking that it not be used in the election campaign.

In one year, for example, 1988, he revealed to the tax office in a document he signed that his taxable income was $7,000. According to the tax office, it was $47,000. </PARA>

I am now of course being regarded as being the offender for having done so. Information about his tax liability, according to Senator Evans, did not go to the question of Dr Macdonald's integrity; it was a gross invasion of privacy.

It seems to me an interesting decision, but it is one that was taken.

But on the question of revealing his either innocent tax avoidance from which he benefited substantially and then kept secret&mdash;in other words, whether he initiated it or simply accepted it&mdash;I have no apology to make.

There is no other person on either side of this parliament&mdash;including the House of Representatives&mdash;who has so consistently used the privileges of this parliament to raise issue after issue.

I think that right in the parliamentary system is absolute, and I will always argue it. But those who use it have to be judged on how they have used it or abused it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume has lived by the sword of parliamentary privilege since 1975 and, in the last five days, he has died by it. At long last he has overstepped the bounds of proprietary and decency because of his own inept stupidity in trying to make a political attack on an Independent member of another parliament&mdash;Dr Macdonald, the Independent member for Manly&mdash;36 hours before polling day in a state election. He did it knowing, and his motive was quite clear, that there would be no opportunity for Dr Macdonald to reply to these accusations&mdash;which in the public's mind are extremely serious&mdash;that he had not paid his full taxation, that he had diddled the tax man. That is what Senator Baume did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first question I put to Senator Baume is: how long did you have the documents before you carelessly tabled them in here without properly reading them? I understand that way back in 1992 Mr Greiner&mdash;then I think still Premier&mdash;received information informally, unofficially, off the back of a truck, as they say, about Dr Macdonald's tax matters. That was in 1992&mdash;2 1/2 years ago. We all know that Senator Baume, and he has made it very clear in this place, is a great acolyte and defender of the former New South Wales Premier Mr Greiner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot accuse him directly of receiving that information from Mr Greiner any time in the last 2 1/2 years, because I do not know. But you would have to be suspicious that sometime since 1992 Mr Greiner, in his bitterness at being forced out of the premiership, said to his friend Michael Baume, `At the appropriate time, at the death knock of the next state election, here is the material you will dump in the Senate under privilege where he will not be able to respond. We'll get him, and we'll win the seat of Manly.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately for Senator Baume and Mr Greiner&mdash;because apparently it was common gossip around Liberal Party circles during 1992 and 1993 that this material was in Mr Greiner's hands, and members of the Liberal Party in New South Wales knew about it&mdash;Dr Macdonald took the very useful step in his own defence of going to Mr Fahey, the then Premier, and explaining to him the situation that had occurred. Mr Fahey said, `I agree. I won't raise it. It doesn't need to be raised.' The limp excuse from Senator Baume is, `Mr Fahey didn't tell me there had been some agreement.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say, on balance of probability, Mr Fahey has probably got the good sense not to tell Senator Baume, who has the worst reputation for using privilege to dump documents all over the table to smear everybody in sight. So he may well have made that sensible judgment not to tell Michael Baume but, if it is common gossip in the Liberal Party, apparently, that these documents were in Mr Greiner's possession, one can only suspect that there are questions to be answered. Did Mr Greiner give it to Senator Baume? How long did Mr Baume have the documents?</PARA>

The clear inference is that Senator Baume did something wrong, that he was in some way responsible in an improper way. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would have to rule that, if it means anything, it must reflect adversely on Senator Baume.

In this matter it is not inappropriate for a topic to be raised in debate. However, it is improper for any improper motive or action to be attributed by one senator to another. Senator Schacht gives the assurance that he did not make any statement about anything done improperly by Senator Baume but rather by a company. I therefore ask Senator Schacht to continue with his remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. With just a few minutes to go, I will go back to the absolute number of questions that have to be answered by Senator Baume. Firstly, when did Senator Baume get the documents and how long did he have them before tabling them in this parliament? He has given us this weak and lame excuse, blaming Senator Crowley: because she only had a couple of minutes to look at them, it was her fault, not his. Secondly, did he get the documents from Mr Greiner? We have never had any evidence in his defence. He has never made any comment in his defence about where he got the documents from or for how long he had them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, what efforts did Senator Baume make to check the documents, in view of the importance of the issue pertaining to the material at hand that he was going to table? Senator Baume says that he had no contact with Mr Fahey, but Mr Fahey has absolutely repudiated Senator Baume's actions. That I think says more than anything the Labor Party can say about Senator Baume&mdash;that a Liberal premier, who may be going out of office in a couple of days time partly because of the actions of Senator Baume in his amazing act during the last 24 hours of the campaign, has repudiated Senator Baume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this motion is carried&mdash;and I hope it is&mdash;the case will go to the Privileges Committee. I think it is about time that a senator like Senator Baume face the Privileges Committee and has the chance to put his case in the hearings of that committee. The Privileges Committee can then report back to us. If the Privileges Committee can come back and outline a standard of behaviour without diminishing the absolute right of privilege of parliament, that would be a great advance. If it in any way curtails the smear tactics of Senator Baume, that would be a great advantage for this parliament and it would be greatly welcomed by the people of this country. As a result of this action by Senator Baume, I repeat what I said in my opening remarks, he has lived by the sword on privilege for 17 years in this parliament&mdash;</PARA>

Labor Party members were particularly upset that Senator Baume led the public debate on the question of Mr Keating's pig farm,  his pig farming interest. They said, `The gall of this senator to raise questions about potential conflicts of interest in respect of the Prime Minister of Australia going out and buying into multi-million dollar piggeries!'

He embarrassed the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, in particular. Senator Evans said the debt was only $6 million, and the debt turned out to be $10 million. Senator Evans said, `We're repaying it at $10,000 a month.' In actual fact, the Labor Party was not repaying the debt at all. It was only making payments off interest. It was not $10,000 a month&mdash;it was $10,000 a week. Members of the Labor Party think, `For Senator Baume to suggest that there might have been cash payments of that money is disgraceful.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the government that comes in tonight and says, `We are all about privacy.' This was the government of the Australia Card.

Nevertheless, those opposite had no compunction about that. They had no concern about the privacy of that individual. The cheque went down on the table. It was a window of opportunity to attack someone on our side. What double standards! It is no wonder the Australian people are getting so sick of this government. They are so sick of its double standards. This is the government of deceit. This is the Prime Minister of deceit. This was the Prime Minister that went out at the last election and told the Australian people, `There will not be tax increases under us. It's not just a promise. It's already in the law: l-a-w, law.' Of course, as soon as we got back here, the promise was broken; the law was broken.

Where was the evidence of that secret deal when he was put under pressure? The evidence did not exist, because the deal did not exist. But that did not stop Mr Keating from slurring the character of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, arguing that he was not fit to be Leader of the Opposition, let alone Prime Minister.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To me, that is an extraordinary argument and would create a very dangerous precedent. Just think of how many instances there are across the whole political spectrum where one comes in here and criticises an opponent.

<PARA>It has absolutely nothing to do with this matter whatsoever. I can only assume that Senator Evans did not read section 4 either.

Senator Baume, in his pathetic defence, talked about integrity. Senator Baume said that this was an offensive motion to him and he referred to Dr Macdonald as sanctimonious. The political get square in this issue was Senator Baume's disgraceful attempt last Thursday night to malign the character of Dr Macdonald.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Baume launched his outrageous attack on Dr Peter Macdonald, the member for Manly, last Thursday night in the adjournment debate&mdash;I was present for that debate&mdash;Senator Baume tried to justify that attack on two grounds. The first ground was that the references in an earlier debate that day to the tax affairs of Phillip Smiles, a former state Liberal MP, were `cheap shots'. He felt that, as a result of Phillip Smiles's tax affairs being raised in this chamber, he had to get on board and make some allegations about Dr Macdonald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second ground Senator Baume endeavoured to use to defend his revealing of this tax information regarding Dr Macdonald and the tax file number was that the supporters of Dr Macdonald were going to `drop a bucket' on Mr Oldfield, the Liberal candidate for Manly. Senator Baume decided, and stated quite clearly, that he had to get in first because of what he claimed had been planned by Dr Macdonald and his supporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point to make about the first ground upon which Senator Baume tried to justify his attack is that there is absolutely no similarity between the raising of the issue of Phillip Smiles's tax cheating, for which he was convicted, and the abuse of parliamentary privilege by Senator Baume last Thursday during the adjournment debate when he referred to Dr Macdonald's tax affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remarks that I made in the debate earlier that day in the matter of public importance regarding Phillip Smiles have long been a matter of public record. Indeed, the details of Mr Smiles's tax evasion, for which he was convicted and for which he resigned from parliament, had been referred to very early on in the New South Wales state election campaign. They were a matter of public record; indeed, they were a part of the advertising campaign and the debate going on in respect of the New South Wales state election.

But, as they say, if you throw enough mud some of it sticks. That is what Senator Baume was intending to do&mdash;to throw a huge bucket of mud. It is okay if he gets a few facts wrong and if he unfortunately released the tax file number; he will try to apologise and set it right later. That is what he is implying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, has already indicated, if Senator Baume released that document in public outside this parliament, he would have committed an offence punishable by two years imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000 or both. During his speech last Thursday night, Senator Baume, when referring to this alleged bucket job that Dr Macdonald's supporters were going to drop on the Liberal candidate, said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the purpose of the bucket job is to demonstrate that Dr Macdonald is a man of greater integrity than his opponents, then it simply will not work. The reason is that Dr Macdonald's own taxation record shows a lack of integrity that must be of major concern to his constituents in Manly.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the words of Senator Baume. The allegations that the supporters of Dr Macdonald would be dropping a bucket on Mr Oldfield the next day were completely without foundation. It was the classic straw man argument. No evidence was presented to the Senate last Thursday night by Senator Baume to suggest that any such campaign was to be undertaken by Dr Macdonald's supporters. He provided absolutely no evidence for that allegation. He just stated that, because he said it was a fact, it must be accepted as a fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No bucket campaign was undertaken by Dr Macdonald's supporters on the Friday or the Saturday. The real bucket job was Senator Baume's, when he tabled the letter from the Taxation Office to Dr Macdonald, which included Dr Macdonald's tax file number. So it is clear that the person who dropped the bucket was Senator Baume. The problem for Senator Baume is that a bigger bucket is being dropped on his head. The person who lacks integrity is not Dr Macdonald; it is Senator Baume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, Senator Baume has been trying to worm his way out of his predicament by a series of lame excuses. First of all, he claims that he did not discuss the matter with  Premier Fahey and that, if he did, he certainly would not have done it. He also claims that he was not aware the tax file number was on the correspondence before he tabled it. That is a truly pathetic excuse. As I said, it was Senator Baume's duty, in raising this most sensitive issue&mdash;an invasion of someone's privacy by the revealing of their tax information&mdash;in a serious situation to ensure that he got all the facts straight and that he knew what he was doing. To now come in and say that he did not know the tax file number was on the correspondence is a truly pathetic excuse. It is nothing more than an attempt to avoid responsibility. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On previous occasions in this chamber there has been a great deal of debate about privacy. Senators on both sides have spoken about the critical need to protect people's privacy. Senator Baume has on a number of occasions spoken most piously about the need to protect privacy. On 21 December 1989, in the debate on the Privacy Amendment Bill, Senator Baume said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let us recognise that it was the Opposition which, in a very clear and determined way, established a real concern for privacy in this place at the time of the tax file number debate . . . There is no doubt that in the Opposition ranks there is clear concern about the need for privacy and for appropriate legislation to protect people.</PARA>
<PARA>Those noble words were spoken by Senator Baume. In that speech I have just quoted Senator Baume referred to the previous debate on the tax file legislation. That debate took place in 1988. Senator Baume said on 9 November 1988:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The upgraded tax file number will now be required only in the relationship between the Australian Taxation Office and the taxpayer. Just as we now have a tax file number, this new system will represent an improvement on that tax file number but the only people who will have a requirement to use that number will be those in the Taxation Office and the taxpayer; just as it is now.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on in his speech on the tax file number legislation Senator Baume stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the massive changes we have proposed to this legislation revenue will be collected, but it will be collected in an honest and honourable way, not by using a device with the hidden agenda of compiling secret banks of information against the wishes of individual taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Baume further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We made certain that it did not unreasonably intrude upon personal privacy and civil liberties by our massive privacy legislation amendments.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Baume concluded his remarks on that occasion by stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Australian population will be grateful to us not only for protecting their privacy but also for ensuring that this legislation will collect revenue from tax cheats without being intrusive.</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear now that Senator Baume's words on that occasion were mere rhetoric and amount to hypocrisy. It is clear that when it comes to issues of protecting privacy Senator Baume does not practice what he preaches so often. Last Thursday night Senate Baume said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the game is going to be played like this, so that at the last minute buckets are going to be dropped, then I think people who drop buckets&mdash;I acknowledge this for myself too&mdash;have to face the risk of having buckets dropped on them.</PARA>
<PARA>On this comment, Senator Baume should be taken at his word. The bucket has well and truly dropped on him. By any standard the Senate should take the strongest possible action to oppose such blatant abuses of parliamentary privilege as we saw last Thursday. We often hear claims that one comment or another which senators may make reflects badly upon the chamber. Make no mistake, when parliamentary privilege is so abused, when there is such blatant and indefensible disregard for the privacy of an individual for reasons of political advantage, when acts which would otherwise constitute crimes are performed under the protection of parliamentary privilege then the Senate must respond, we must firmly reject those actions and we must censure those responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Debates in this chamber do not occur in isolation. They have a real effect on those throughout the community. Whilst we do not know what damage may have been done to Dr Macdonald through these callous actions, what we do know is that such abuses must not be tolerated. The pathetic defence of Senator Baume that has been advanced tonight should not be tolerated either. No fair minded person can excuse this conduct. Senator Baume should be censured. I urge honourable senators to support the motion. </PARA>

Presumably, he did that in defence of Senator Crowley and to explain why even someone with Senator Crowley's limited intelligence needs more than five minutes to read two pages. What he was doing was saying that you should not blame Senator Crowley for the fact that she could not detect that this was a tax file number. Senator Baume has made that clear as well. He had this document for a couple of hours. It had written on it `file number'. That in itself does not indicate any awareness that it was a tax file number. Indeed, all of Senator Baume's subsequent actions were to the contrary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You judge a person in criminal law not only by what he says but also by what he does. That is how you ought to judge politicians, too. As soon as the matter was drawn to his attention, Senator Baume immediately sought to retrieve the document and black out the tax file number. I have not heard Senator Forshaw say that he blacked out any tax file number, and I did not hear him say that he did not show the document to anyone. He said that he had not shown it to anyone outside this chamber. He was waving a document around to Senator Schacht and Senator Evans, so I think he should explain whether or not he did show it to those two people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he did not reveal the number, we are still left with the fact that the tax file number has not been disclosed to a single person. It is not on the public record. No-one knows it, unless the other unidentified, flying Labor senator somehow went out and told someone and we do not know about it. Senator Evans says he does not know who has seen it. Where is the publication? Where is there a skerrick of evidence that anyone has actually seen the tax file number? So the question of whether Dr Macdonald has suffered a detriment is one issue. Clearly, if no-one knows his tax file number, you can hardly say that he has suffered gravely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more important issue relates to the wording of the censure motion and why it is so fundamentally flawed. You will note very carefully that the motion does not allege that there was anything wrong with Senator Baume bringing to the attention of the electors of Manly the fact that their member of parliament had understated his income by in excess of $100,000. We have not had any complaint made about that; it is not mentioned in this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this motion does is continue to complain that, by drawing attention to the tax file number identified therein, a criminal offence was committed. How can you be guilty of a criminal offence if you did not know that the tax file number was there and you did not intend to commit an offence? It is a very simple proposition, and I would have thought that Senator Evans would know it. That is why his conduct of going through this charade of making very serious allegations is reprehensible to the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could understand it if you had wanted to complain and say, `These are the sorts of tactics we wouldn't use. They are dirty tricks.' But you have not done that. You have come in here and solemnly alleged that a criminal offence has been committed. There is not a skerrick of evidence to support that. The facts simply do not stack up. That is why you have grossly overplayed your hand. As Senator Hill quite rightly pointed out, you waffle on about all this nonsense of Senator Baume having `incompletely informed the Senate as to the nature of the documents'. What is the nature of the documents? The documents are a tax assessment indicating the underpayment of income. There has been no incomplete information to the Senate as to the nature of those documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What you are presumably intending to try to convey is that you did not point out that there was a tax file number on it. We have heard Senator Baume say that he was not aware of it at the time. Then the complaint is that he did it `without the Senate being aware of that consequence'. Who is the Senate? The Senate comprises individuals. Only Senator Baume, Senator Forshaw and another unidentified senator know anything about this matter. How is the Senate unaware of the consequence? What is the consequence? Is it the consequence of the number being circulated to two senators? It is an absolute nonsense. Just to show how fraudulent this whole exercise is, you end up with this proposition: that the Privileges Committee should inquire and report into:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">if the action of Senator Baume could not be held to be a contempt under the law as it presently stands, whether such action should be able to be held to be a contempt.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the government is saying to the Privileges Committee, `Look at it and see whether he has committed a crime. If he hasn't, tell us how we can show that he did, after all, commit one.' Kafka would have loved that. You are really saying, `By hook or by crook, by whatever means or facts, we want to demonstrate that somehow or other Senator Baume is guilty of contempt, and, if necessary, we will change the law.'

I hope Senator Loosley is listening to this.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So why would Senator Evans have even got himself into that impossible situation of logic? Do you know what he then said when he was absolutely cornered? He said, `Of course he deliberately put the paper on the public record.' In other words, the mere fact that somehow he did not accidentally put the paper on the public record&mdash;that he tabled it&mdash;is supposed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he had a criminal intent to disclose a tax file number of which he was not aware. It is an absolute nonsense, and that is why it is a fraudulent case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a classic example of a trumped up charge. You are absolutely desperate to change the subject.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not in any way a legitimate attempt to demonstrate that a senator in this chamber has been guilty of a criminal offence. This is worded in such a way as to make it clear that you do not even have a case. You complain that he did not draw attention to the tax file number identified therein. It is such a manifest logical inconsistency to say that whether or not you knew about something you failed in your duty by not drawing it to someone's attention, to say that merely because there was an unauthorised disclosure you must have committed a criminal offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take someone who has a bunch of tax files on the back seat of his car and the car is broken into. Is he guilty because there was an unauthorised disclosure? Of course he is not. If you left them in the pub and someone got hold of them, that is an unauthorised disclosure. Are you guilty of a criminal offence? Of course you are not. The only way in which you can be guilty of a criminal offence is if you intended to break the law. There is not a scintilla of evidence to suggest that Senator Baume intended to do that&mdash;in fact, quite the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I think not only Senator Harradine but also, I am sure, other members of this chamber who are not simply locked into slavishly following the tactics adopted by Senator Evans on this occasion will take this matter with the utmost seriousness and will not be confused by issues of whether or not you would personally have chosen to disclose matters. John Fahey might have agreed not to but there is nothing at all to suggest that John Fahey told Senator Baume not to do what he did, nor is there a skerrick of evidence to suggest that Senator Baume was aware of that agreement. So how, again, could you possibly hold that against Senator Baume?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, once again, you trot out the fact that the New South Wales Premier publicly stated he had been aware of the matter and undertaken not to raise it. So what? It has nothing whatsoever to do with Senator Baume's behaviour unless Senator Baume was aware of that agreement and deliberately breached it, and the evidence is quite to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, Senator Evans did not repeat Peter Macdonald's utterly defamatory allegation that John Fahey had put Michael Baume up to it. What is the basis for saying something like that? You cannot just wave these things around. Quite clearly, you have to look at the facts and the facts here point in only one direction. There is no case to answer. There is not even the basis of a prima facie case in terms of the criminal law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be absolutely amazed to hear Senator Loosley argue that Senator Evans did not do anything other than get it fundamentally wrong when he said that there was sufficient evidence of deliberateness by merely putting papers on the public record.

You are simply wanting to raise the political heat. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To think that somehow this chamber could seriously be asked to effectively convict and refer a matter to the Privileges Committee based on evidence which even the mover of the motion concedes does not amount to a deliberate intent to commit a criminal offence&mdash;there is no evidence of breaching the law&mdash;and to say that because he might have acted recklessly and that somehow that supports a serious charge of committing an offence punishable by two years imprisonment is ludicrous in the extreme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The New South Wales election on 25 March was always going to be very, very close. It is very clear from the Liberal campaign in the last week or so that Manly was going to be absolutely pivotal in so far as the Liberal assessment was concerned about its fortunes. So a week or so out there was a massive blitz in Manly of direct mail from Nick Greiner. Two days later we had John Fahey appear&mdash;again, a concerted Liberal focus on Manly. It assumed a crucial significance to the conservative campaign. Then of course 24 hours out, in an act of desperation, Senator Baume launched a violent personal attack upon the sitting Independent member, Dr Macdonald.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this was poll driven. It was driven by Liberal Party internal polling. The reason I can say that with great confidence tonight in the Senate is that yesterday over lunch Senator Baume boasted that, before his attack on Dr Macdonald, Dr Macdonald had a five per cent lead. This disappeared of course after the attack. The unfortunate thing from Dr Macdonald's point of view was that he had precious little time in which to respond. This was poll driven. It was a deliberate tactic by the New South Wales Liberal Party to take the seat of Manly from the sitting Independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over recent times we have seen different tactics from the American Republican Party imported into this country. We have seen push polling in the ACT. We have seen negative ads, built upon negative ads until they constituted the entire campaign. We have seen inflammatory direct mail. We have seen unsubstantiated allegations. We have seen the tendency on the part of the Liberal Party, particularly in New South Wales, to divinise opponents; now we arrive at the situation where Senator Baume seeks to criminalise opponents. That was the intent of the attack upon Dr Macdonald on the last day or so prior to the New South Wales general election, to accuse the sitting Independent member, Dr Macdonald&mdash;I think he will be returned; on the count today it looks like he will be returned&mdash;of having been guilty of at best gross negligence in terms of his taxes and at worst criminal offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act of putting all that detail into the public record here in the Senate chamber, regardless of whether or not the tax file number was obvious and published, is appalling by any standard. I regard it as an honour to serve in this place. I regard it as a privilege. I think everybody ought to regard it as a privilege. All of us have responsibilities and obligations here. This kind of activity lowers the Senate by way of its performance. It is a stain upon the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The indignity of what was inflicted upon Dr Macdonald is compounded by the fact that two New South Wales Liberals have actually been convicted of tax offences. This is not a matter that had been canvassed in the parliament in Macquarie Street or here. But they have been before the courts. It was a matter of public record. We have the Smiles affair and the Metherell affair&mdash;people convicted of tax offences. These were not false allegations as they turned out to be in respect of Dr Macdonald. </PARA>

As a consequence of what you have done I think you will become known as `Senator Own Government'. I think you have done your own government in New South Wales.

Either Dr Macdonald is likely never to look favourably upon the New South Wales Liberal Party again or, alternatively, is likely to hold the seat forever, or as long as he wants it, courtesy of what you have done because now the allegation has been proven to be absolutely and utterly false. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Steven Garden was an employee of the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, which was trading as Pacific Power. He had been an employee since about 1980. In January 1992, by his own admission, he stole scaffolding from Pacific Power valued at around $300. He was subsequently apprehended by the police as he was hiding the scaffolding in the bush. Again, by his own admission, he lied to police on several occasions about exactly what he was doing with this scaffolding as he was secreting it away, having transported it there in one of Pacific Power's own vehicles. Subsequently, he pleaded guilty in the relevant court to a charge of larceny as a servant. Because of his previous good character, no conviction was recorded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of this theft from the Electricity Commission, Pacific Power decided it would sack Mr Steven Garden. On the face of it, it seemed like a very reasonable thing to do. Mr Steven Garden subsequently appealed to the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission and the matter was heard by one of the counsellors, and the decision from the counsellor at the time was that Mr Garden should be reinstated with back pay for some 13 months. The matter was then appealed to the full commission, and the full commission endorsed the decision of the individual commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to ask yourself: why is this the case? On the face of it, it does seem pretty crazy that somebody who pleaded guilty in the courts to stealing from his employers&mdash;was found guilty by his own admission&mdash;and was sacked for stealing from his employers, was ordered to be reinstated. The reasons given by the commission and confirmed were that the theft was, in fact, community minded. It was community minded apparently because Mr Steven Garden had stolen the scaffolding because he wanted to make use of it for his local surf club. This is community mindedness being taken to an extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was always a great fan of the Robin Hood principle of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. In the time of Robin Hood we had serfs and vassals, and effectively slaves, stealing from, raping, pillaging and plundering lords of the manor. Sometimes the bills from Pacific Power get a bit high, but I do not think you can put them in the plunging, pillaging and raping category and, indeed, I do not think you can put Mr Steven Garden into the category of a vassal or a serf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the question we have to ask is: where does this actually lead us? If the Industrial Relations Commission in New South Wales or elsewhere is going to take the view that theft is okay&mdash;and not only turn a blind eye to it but actually condone it and, indeed, in some ways, endorse it because it is community minded&mdash;what happens if somebody pinches a video cassette recorder to take it to the local spastic centre, for example? Where does this end? Is it okay to steal a video cassette recorder because it is going to a worthy cause? It seems to me that this is theft, theft is a crime, and we should not in any way encourage individuals to commit a crime against anybody and particularly not against their employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a growing trend in Australia towards enshrining the so-called rights of workers at the expense of what really are the fundamental rights of employers, regardless of the facts. The federal industrial relations courts have, indeed, also been moving towards a position where the rights of workers to keep their jobs takes precedence over any wrongdoing, no matter how extreme it might be on the parts of those workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until recently, the New South Wales IR commissioner had taken a much more rational approach, but this case clearly indicates that there are major aberrations in the New South Wales systems. This is a clear example of a case where people who have been sacked have been reinstated in defiance of all reason and rationality. It is not as if it is a minor amount; it is over $300. The fact is that this is clearly ridiculous because the person concerned was found guilty by the courts and was reinstated because he was doing this for a good cause. Where do you stop? The next situation is that employees could steal anything belonging to their employers and expect to keep their jobs if the reasons in this case were to apply elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that this situation is completely untenable. It means presumably that bosses never have the right to sack any staff no matter what they do in the workplace. If you carry this to its logical end, it means that those caught robbing their employers will be able to get away with naming some community organisation as the alleged beneficiary of their actions, as a means of escaping either punishment or dismissal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision obviously has trivialised and undermined a very vital part of our industrial relations system. It sends all the wrong signals to the workers who want to rip off the boss. It really does mean that our system is being turned on its head, and I am amazed not only that the decision was made in the first place but that it was confirmed by the full Industrial Relations Commission in New South Wales. There is really now a situation where somebody who was previously a supervisor for Pacific Power&mdash;and, therefore, would be expected to give a better than average example of integrity and honesty and decency&mdash;stole from the company and Pacific Power has now been forced to reemploy this man, presumably in his same position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message he will give to the people working under him is simply this: you can steal from Pacific Power and get away with it. Not only do you not have a conviction recorded against you&mdash;which may well be reasonable in this case if his character really was as good as it apparently was&mdash;but you can actually get reinstated to your job and paid for the time you had off the job because you were sacked because you stole from your employers. It does seem to me to be crazy. If our industrial relations system is encouraging people to steal from their employers, where does this end? We have to maintain some sort of decency, integrity and values in our IR system. To condone and, indeed, to encourage this sort of behaviour is going to lead to all sorts of problems in the future. </PARA>
