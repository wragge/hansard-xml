<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. As background I advise the minister that over the weekend I received a letter from a university science graduate, a Brook Sumner, saying he had unsuccessfully applied for over 100 jobs in the last three and a half months with some of Australia's leading companies. He says&mdash;and I am happy to let you have the letter:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have studied in an attempt to improve my employment prospects but to no avail. To then see the Prime Minister telling a group of students with very real concerns `. . . get a job', really sticks in my throat.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister, will you now condemn this cheap shot at students and will you accept responsibility for youth unemployment in this country running at 27 per cent, and much higher in Labor's heartland, and also for the historically high levels of unemployment and underemployment of recent university graduates?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2099" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The context in which the Prime Minister made his remarks ought to be fully understood. He was not dealing with a demonstration by young unemployed or by people expressing concern about the employment situation; he was dealing with a peculiarly noisy and loud and offensive demonstration by students who were making the utterly spurious claim about the government's intention to have up-front fees for undergraduates, something that we have never believed in and never will implement. We have made that absolutely clear over and over again. The Prime Minister's remark in that context should be seen as an essentially tongue-in-cheek, ironic riposte, and one that was perfectly understandable in the circumstances of the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So whatever may be the situation so far as any individual is concerned&mdash;it is always impossible to comment on the employability of a particular individual without knowing the circumstances of the case&mdash;the truth of the matter is that those students demonstrating on that day are more likely to get jobs than any other single class of Australians. Under this government in the last two years the economy has created over 500,000 new jobs&mdash;in fact, 570,000 since that commitment was made&mdash;more than 720 new jobs every day. The unemployment rate of graduates is little more than half of what it is for the population as a whole, and about a third of what it is for those who did not complete secondary school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a government that believes that anyone without a job at the moment can get one at will. That is not the situation. Because we know it is not the situation, we have introduced as many programs as we have to deal with it. Why would we introduce Working Nation last year, at a cost of $6.5 million over four years, if we thought that there were sufficient jobs available for everyone who wanted them? Why would we have introduced the most radical training and employment initiatives in our history if we thought that work was available to everyone who wants it? Of course it is not; of course it should be. But we are working a hell of a lot harder than those opposite could conceivably imagine to produce that particular result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those opposite say that Working Nation is a waste of money, as they have done, they are making absolutely clear their own indifference to the very people they are shedding crocodile tears about in this kind of question. Of course it is the case that some young people are more vulnerable to unemployment than others. The most vulnerable are early school leavers. To address this, the government has introduced policies which have produced a quite dramatic growth in the number of students staying on at school to complete year 12. Over the last decade year 12 retention rates have doubled, to 77 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our objective remains that, by the year 2001, 95 per cent of 19-year-olds will have completed year 12 or equivalent. In addition, as part of the Working Nation measures&mdash;those very measures upon which the opposition has poured nothing but scorn since their implementation&mdash;we have introduced the youth training initiative to address the specific needs of young people. That commenced this year on 1 January. It aims to assist unemployed kids between 15 and 17 to gain appropriate and ongoing employment by providing access to suitable education, training and work experience opportunities with, in order to achieve this, kids being assisted by case managers&mdash;managers who will help young people search for suitable work, training or education opportunities and will be able to refer clients to labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New income support arrangements, called the youth training allowance, will provide support for young people participating in the YTI. They will also be assisted to obtain places with an increased number and range of entry level training and labour market program places available to these young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what we are doing about kids getting jobs. That is what we are doing about early school leavers, kids in that age range, and that is what we have been able to do so far as graduates are concerned and others who are more obviously satisfying the skill needs of the market at the moment. It is a very proud record indeed, and it stands in dramatic contrast to the way in which those opposite have approached this issue&mdash;all rhetoric, all puff, all inconsistent assertions about spending too much money on the wrong things&mdash;when what they are doing is doing nothing for the young kids of this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question because, really, the minister, in his answer, went down the same path of seeking self-congratulations. He says, `We have a proud record.' Minister, do you call a proud record 27 per cent of young Australians who are seeking work being unable to get a job? Are the historically high levels of young graduates who cannot get a job part of your proud record? Wouldn't you do better by apologising on behalf of your Prime Minister for his cheap shot and facing up to your responsibility as the national government rather than gloating about successes that are basically false?</PARA></TALK.START>

You scoffed and you chortled when we talked about 500,000 new jobs over the next three years. You said it could not be done. It has been done in just on two years.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2F4">Senator BURNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Minister, last December you announced a major restructuring of the statutory arrangements for the meat and livestock industry. Can you advise the Senate of the progress to date in implementing the arrangements? Has the industry responded positively to the changes that are being made?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2100" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to advise the Senate that the industry has responded positively. As senators would be aware, the government announced last December details of new arrangements that will provide the meat and livestock industry with much greater responsibility for its own affairs, move it to a less regulated environment and reshape the statutory bodies to allow them to better address the future commercial and consumer challenges for the Australian beef industry, which of course is a multi-billion dollar industry, both domestically and particularly with exports. Australia is in fact the world's largest exporter of beef.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislative changes that will give effect to all of this will be introduced in parliament this week&mdash;I think on Wednesday. Central to the new arrangements is the establishment of a new representative meat industry council. The council has a clear responsibility for developing the vision and strategic directions for the meat industry and for formulating broad industry policy. The council consists of industry leaders who are nominated by industry organisations as agreed with the peak industry levy-paying bodies. That is the key to this new council: it comprises representatives of industries that are actually paying the levies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a good idea, Senator Panizza. Thank you for that commendation. In order to continue the momentum for change generated by the reform process, an interim council, chaired by Robin Bligh, has already commenced work. Geoff Jureidini, who has extensive senior management experience in the food industry with companies such as Allied Mills and Goodman Fielder, has recently been appointed as the chief executive officer for the MIC.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The council held a workshop involving representatives of the major industry bodies, companies and federal and state governments in Sydney this month. I am very pleased with the positive and immediate response by industry to this vitally important issue.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Is it not the case that the Canberra by-election is a direct rebuff of a prime minister who has ignored the concerns of mainstream Australia and that Australians are sick and tired of his arrogance, his political grandstanding while overseas, his cynical manipulation of events to suit his own view of the world and, most importantly, his insensitivity, not just to the people of Canberra but also to university students, families and older Australians&mdash;in fact, to anyone who is concerned with what is happening in Australia rather than redesigning Berlin, conducting Mahler or running the Bundesbank? Why is Tasmanian leader Michael Field not right when he says that the government is out of touch, arrogant and complacent? The Prime Minister says that he has heard the message, so why does he continue to blame everyone but himself when he is overwhelmingly the problem?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nobody doubts that there are a number of messages for the government in the Canberra by-election result. It would be foolish of us to say otherwise. Some of those messages are, particularly when dealing with the greenest electorate in the nation, that it is very important to get your decision making processes right and be seen to be right on an issue like woodchips. It is also the case in an electorate like this that, as so much elsewhere in the country, there is a high level of uncertainty about the economic future. It is important to be able to convey the message that not only do we have a strong growth rate at the moment but that that growth rate is sustainable and that interest rates, to the extent that they need to rise at all, will certainly not need to rise, on all our present expectations, to anything like the levels that prevailed in the 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is necessary to get these messages across, but it is very difficult to do that before you have actually put a budget down and before the community, the electorate, has had a few months to see for itself that our confidence, our optimism, is in fact justified. That is a very relevant consideration, but what we have to take into account, learn and appreciate is the need to communicate and to understand better the immediate nature of the concerns that people in the community do have about this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were obviously some local factors that need to be taken into account in the electorate and we need to take into account the fact, of course, in weighing and balancing all this, that for better or worse, deserved or otherwise, your new leader is still, for the moment anyway, enjoying a little bit of a honeymoon, a honeymoon that is going to be a pretty tarnished old affair by the time it is over. But it will be over and I think people will see these things in better perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept that the result should be personalised in the way in which you have chosen inevitably to do. I know you cannot think in policy terms. Those on the other side of this chamber, on the other side of this parliament, are not serious about policy. If you were serious about policy you would tell us what you are going to do about the situation of the economy rather than just saying what you are not going to do. If you were serious about policy you would tell us what you are going to do about media ownership. If you were serious about policy you would tell us precisely what you are going to do about all the other issues which are on the agenda at the moment and from which you want to do nothing else but duck and run and hide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can duck and run and hide for a few more weeks, I suppose&mdash;maybe even a few more months&mdash;but you cannot duck and run and hide forever. Sooner or later you will have to make clear to the Australian public positively what it is you stand for. When you do that, the nakedness of your policy aspirations, the nakedness of your claims to be able to better govern this country, will be starkly revealed to the whole country.</PARA>

Now that the New South Wales election is safely out of the way, and the Prime Minister has acknowledged that interest rates were an issue which spooked the electorate in Canberra, will you rule out further increases in interest rates prior to the budget?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The closure and sale of the Laverton and Point Cook airfields was announced in May 1991 as part of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence Force Structure Review</EMPHASIS>. Following that announcement, I established a consultative committee with representatives of Defence, the Victorian government and the local council to consider the future option of the two sites. The review took into account the fact that a range of non-airfield activities was to be maintained by Defence at both airfields. These included the RAAF college and the RAAF museum at Point Cook. Essentially, the outcome of the committee review was that non-aviation uses would be pursued for the Laverton airfield and that Point Cook should remain available for aviation purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My predecessor had given his in-principle approval for the use of Laverton for the National Air and Space Museum of Australia, NASMA, while it remained a Defence airfield. In view of the decision to market Laverton, I agreed to consider Point Cook as a location for NASMA. Discussions to identify arrangements to permit the establishment of NASMA at Point Cook have been under way for some time between Defence and NASMA officials. In part, those discussions have focused on the need to protect Defence's interest in maintaining the value of its historical asset and in preserving the viability of the RAAF museum. At the same time, I understand that NASMA has been finetuning its structure and its business planning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of these activities, I am now in a position to announce that I have given in-principle approval to the establishment of NASMA at Point Cook. The proposed agreement between Defence and NASMA has two principal components. One covers the display and storage facilities on the northern tarmac area, which will operate under a 50-year lease. The second relates to NASMA assuming responsibility for the management of the airfield operations at Point Cook on a revenue sharing basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome has been possible because of the cooperative arrangements that have developed between the RAAF museum and NASMA. These will involve the sharing of some facilities and the development by NASMA of display areas. Construction work is scheduled to begin later this year, and the opening of NASMA is planned for late 1996. The benefit that this brings to Defence will be recognised through the offsetting of NASMA's rental obligations. A feature of the agreement will be that it maintains a viable operating airfield to complement NASMA's museum display activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity will be afforded to NASMA to operate on a commercial basis. As soon as a formal agreement is in place, Point Cook will be available for airfield operations. Subject to satisfactory resolution of the various issues between officials, this proposal has the potential to offer the public a first-class Australian aviation museum which will reside appropriately at the original home of the Royal Australian Air Force at Point Cook. I add that this will create employment opportunities in the western suburbs of Melbourne. It is a win-win situation for everyone.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could put glasses on; I thank those smart senators opposite. This means a real percentage drop of over five per cent in the first year and a massive 18 plus per cent drop in the last year. That is what the Liberal government in South Australia has done in health expenditure to the state. It makes very important reading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, Commonwealth funding has increased from $363 million to $384 million to $476 million. I will give Senator Lees those figures exactly later. They show a direct and significant increase in Commonwealth funding to the states and a dramatic 18 per cent decrease in state funding to hospitals in the last 12 months. So it is a very good and telling question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening in South Australia is exactly the same as is happening in New South Wales. The states are shifting the money out of the hospital system and then blaming the Commonwealth. The record is that Commonwealth money is increasing and that state money is decreasing. Senator Lees's question is a very important one. While the Commonwealth continues to make a direct and real increase in its funding and is honouring its Medicare agreements, the states are pulling out of the funding. As Senator Lees has alluded to, at the same time they are using the introduction of case mix as an excuse to justify this dramatic cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, Senator Lees asked about cost shifting. The Commonwealth is very concerned about it. Since the inquiry has been under way and the review, which was triggered by the two per cent change in figures, has been conducted, there has already been a review and an interim report on the Commonwealth-state agreements. The Health Insurance Commission has been requested to investigate any reported instances of services being billed to the Commonwealth which should properly be paid for by the states. In some cases, this activity may be fraudulent or illegal as well as contrary to the Medicare agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has written to professional organisations and the state ministers setting out her objection to contrived cost shifting. It is pleasing to note that, on the figures to this point, there seems to have been a reduction in cost shifting by the states to the Commonwealth while that review was under way. One thing that review has shown is these figures: that Commonwealth money is increasing and that state money is decreasing. The state government in South Australia, not the Commonwealth, is responsible for the dramatic increase in waiting lists at the Flinders Medical Centre and the Adelaide hospital. The state government has to answer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer. She has ignored several parts of the question. The figures given are quite misleading. A look at the total amount of money spent on health in South Australia, particularly on hospitals, since 1983 and the percentage that the Commonwealth is contributing shows that it has declined. The state has made some very substantial cuts, particularly to the Flinders Medical Centre, where 20 per cent of its surgery has basically been cancelled for three years. When is the money due under the Medicare agreement&mdash;forget about the reviews; we are talking about the money&mdash;to be handed over to the states? When will the minister do something about the cost shifting? It is fine to say that she is running another review about it. But there is not just the cost shifting to the federal government; there is also the cost shifting to the consumers&mdash;the patients&mdash;and their families. Is the federal government going to act, or is it just going to keep blaming the states?</PARA></TALK.START>

There has been a large amount of cost shifting by the hospitals onto the Commonwealth, particularly in relation to pharmaceuticals in the outpatients area. The largest complaint is with our state governments misusing and cutting back dramatically their funds under the screen of the Commonwealth's responsibility and also under the protection of the increased Commonwealth money.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer the second part of the question first. The Minister for Justice has told me that routine follow-up inquires are being conducted following the incident in Japan. As a consequence, AFP members have attended the sheep station. They have returned to Perth after inspecting the property and locating a quantity of chemicals. The chemicals have been removed to a laboratory and are currently being tested to confirm their content. At this time, it appears that the chemicals are associated with the processing of minerals and are consistent with those which the sect members attempted to bring into the country some 18 months ago. I cannot say any more with respect to any ongoing investigation or assessment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to your question about whether these people entered Australia, I am told that a group of members of the cult, led by Mr Chizuo Matsumoto, visited Australia in September 1993. They were brought to the attention of Customs and immigration officers on arrival at Perth because of the behaviour of some members. I think you raised this question in here some time ago. The group was found by Customs to be carrying mining equipment. Two members were later charged with carrying dangerous goods and each fined $2,400 and ordered to pay court costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that, at that time, a request for advice was made to the entry operation centre in Perth.

At that particular time there was no clear basis to cancel the visas on immigration grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My further advice is that a number of group members have applied for visitor visas in Japan since their visit in September 1993 and all have had their visas refused on the grounds that they do not meet the requirements of the Migration Act and regulations. Once the background of the group became known, all subsequent visa applications were refused.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. My question is set against the background of suggestions that last week's horrific Tokyo subway chemical weapons attack could herald a new wave of international chemical weapons terrorism. Given the apparent ready availability of materials which can be used to manufacture chemical weapons, such as the extremely toxic nerve agent sarin, can the leader advise the Senate how effective the chemical weapons convention is likely to be in combating terrorist use of this type of material? In addition, when is the chemical weapons convention likely to enter into force?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2107" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Needless to say, the Australian government was appalled, as I am sure all honourable senators were, by the attack in Tokyo and condemns it in the strongest possible terms. We do express our deepest condolences to the victims of this mindless act of terror and indeed the Japanese government, which has had to deal with the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the sense of public outrage is entirely appropriate, I think it is fair to say that there is no real evidence to suppose that this incident does herald a new era of terrorism characterised by the use of chemical weapons. It is true that the technology and materials to produce some chemical weapons, such as sarin, are theoretically available to those with appropriate qualifications in chemistry and access to commercial chemicals. But the nature of these weapons is such that, at least in the homemade form, they are likely to be difficult to manage, unpredictable, indiscriminate and extraordinarily dangerous to those who would seek to employ them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the measures which states can take to minimise the risk of CW use by terrorists is to bring about the speedy entry into force of the chemical weapons convention, which bans the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer and use of chemical weapons and does put in place a comprehensive verification regime to ensure compliance. Of course, the CWC's verification regime is aimed at states and is primarily designed to detect and deter military related chemical weapons activity. The use of these weapons in war, as during the Iran-Iraq conflict, remains the greatest threat associated with CW. For example, the worrying reports of Iran stockpiling CW in the Straits of Hormuz is exactly the sort of issue the CWC was designed to deal with. But the global banning and destruction of CW will also reduce the chance of their falling into the hands of terrorist groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally importantly, the strict controls which the convention will put in place will make the illicit procurement of the necessary chemical weapons precursors, particularly from international sources, that much more difficult. Article VII of the convention requires states to implement measures to prevent production of CW in any place in their jurisdiction. Thus the convention does oblige governments to take steps to ensure that individuals or groups of individuals do not make, keep or use CW within their territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we are already seeing, in states' implementation of the legislation pursuant to this treaty, that states are concentrating their minds on the need to fill various legislative and regulatory vacuums that did previously exist before the convention. Australia's implementing legislation, the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act, which we passed last year, for example, as well as expressly prohibiting production or use of chemical weapons, will establish a system of permits and notifications allowing monitoring and control of production, possession or use of a range of chemicals which are useable either as chemical weapons or as precursors to their production. These certainly include sarin and precursors for its manufacture. The maximum penalty prescribed by the act for serious breaches is, in fact, life imprisonment, so you are talking about a very serious set of legislative sanctions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to your last question, 159 states have signed the convention, and 27 states, including Australia, have so far ratified the convention. Current indications are that the trigger for entry into force&mdash;that is, the deposit of the 65th instrument of ratification&mdash;will occur sometime towards the end of this year. Entry into force will then occur automatically 180 days later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of the Tokyo attack on this legislative and ratification activity has already been shown in the steps taken by the Japanese government itself, for example, to accelerate its ratification of the CWC and to pass necessary legislation through the Diet as early as next week. That is something we very warmly welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should just finally add by way of a footnote that our commitment to preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons, is further underlined by the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill, which is currently before the parliament, and that will strengthen our control over involvement by Australians in producing weapons of mass destruction anywhere in the world.</PARA>

All of these industries employ thousands of Australians in permanent jobs, they are extremely important industries for Australia, and they have to be sustained not just to support those jobs but also to support the export performance that those industries have achieved over the last 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those issues were thrashed out at a major meeting of all of the parties which was chaired at my request by Don McGauchie, the President of the National Farmers Federation. I attended that meeting. All of the people representing the major peak bodies, in terms of the grain industry, the lot feeders and the chicken industry, were there. It was acknowledged, even by people who are concerned about the importation of grain, that it was not in Australia's interests to have export orders lost to Australia&mdash;with the great difficulty of then winning them back from some of the processors&mdash;by having a shortfall in the grain which is essential to the continued health of those industries. So it is not an easy question to resolve; it is an extremely difficult one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also fair to say that the requirements that have been placed on grain are scrupulous. To get to one of the central elements of Senator Crane's question, which is problems in particular states in the United States, the protocols do not just involve what happens to the grain when it arrives in Australia; they go all the way back to the source. AQIS has rejected a number of applications for the importation of grain where it was thought that the problems associated with grain in those particular places in the United States were too great to be contemplated. That is why the grain has been sourced from states such as Kansas and Nebraska&mdash;that is, the central western states of the United States&mdash;where it is considered that those problems pose a very low risk. Of course, that is then augmented by the need to treat the grain for pests prior to it leaving the United States and then by the scrupulous procedures that are now in place in Australia once it arrives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it needs to be acknowledged, as I have said, that this is a new thing for Australia. With the exception of the importation of, I think, around 10,000 tonnes of durum wheat a few years ago for the pasta industry, there has been no  history ever of Australia importing levels of grain to this quantity. I can assure Senator Crane and indeed the Senate that this exercise will be conducted in the most scrupulous fashion and that the final manual that will contain the protocols for the importation of grain, which hopefully will be a lesser need rather than a greater need over the remainder of this year, has not yet been concluded.</PARA>

There was a very useful and fruitful discussion with members of the Senate on the progress made in the last 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about here today in response to Senator Murphy's question is the release last week of a report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Looking to the future</EMPHASIS>, which was a review of the industry audit processes within Customs. This is what I would consider one of the first major steps forward in setting a new priority for Customs' relations with industry in this country. When we established the industry advisory board for Customs to get closer advice from industry about the way it should be run and its relations with industry, the first thing it advised me to do was to establish some industry panels to look at specific areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of these panels was established to look at industry audit. It was chaired by the chief executive officer of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, Ian Grigg, with a majority of industry representatives. It presented a report to me which was released last week called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Looking to the future</EMPHASIS>. It is a major report on changing the way Customs will deal with industry. In auditing the processes of industry and in meeting its compliance arrangements, there will now be a theme of self-assessment based on proper risk assessment. This self-assessment will mean that industry will assess what it should pay and the processes of what it should pay, rather than having every transaction checked or attempted to be checked by Customs irrespective of the size. This is a major change and led to the phrase `trading the baseball bat for a smile'. Both industry and Customs will very much welcome this arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the industry panel recommended that we have a one stop shop approach for contact between industry and Customs. Up till now a company having a dealing with Customs may have had to go to three or four different sections of Customs to deal with all its arrangements. We want that to change to a one stop shop approach&mdash;one contact with one officer for all the arrangements for Customs. This will be part of Customs' new  commercial advisory service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also recommended by the industry panel that the officers in this new process should be appropriately trained and accredited with training. This will be another major change in the way Customs prepares its officers for this new culture of being closer to industry. In particular, the training process will be one in which there will be a proper accreditation in externally evaluated training courses so that the Customs audit officers receive the appropriate training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a genuine micro-economic reform that Customs has performed for Australian industry. It will reduce the cost of compliance for industry. An issue that industry has raised consistently has been the cost of compliance with government regulations. The whole process and report of the industry panel is about reducing the cost of compliance on the basis of self-assessment. Customs accepts the fact that 99.9 per cent of industry in complying with customs regulations is honest, and will be willing participate in this new system. It is a major step forward. I look forward to give further reports to the Senate in the near future on similar matters.</PARA>

It is my intention on 19 May next to retire from politics and to resign my seat in the Senate. My decision is motivated primarily by a determination to pursue a second career in the law by accepting an offer to become a director of the international and trade law division of the Sydney firm Dunhill Madden and Butler. The establishment of a new office represents a very real challenge to me personally. The offer that was made to me is substantial in its dimensions, from a firm that is accomplished in a number of areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timing of the announcement is made very deliberately: after the New South Wales general election campaign. This announcement could not have been made prior to the poll on Saturday. I think we have had more than enough federal intrusions. I underline that I spoke with both the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) last week to tell them of my decision. I wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at the end of last week outlining my reasons for retiring from politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my intention to leave politics for the law to pursue a second career which offers both the potential to make a contribution on international issues which are of real consequence to this country and of real interest to me personally and to re-establish a family life where separation in different cities becomes a feature of the past. Essentially, a decision of this nature is better made at age 42 than at age 49. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I canvassed opinion within political and industrial circles of the New South Wales ALP over the summer, it became clear that endorsement for another term in the Senate was secure if I sought it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given all this, it is time to depart soon, well before the general election, to give my party plenty of opportunity to make a deliberate choice about a successor and to give that man or woman plenty of time to establish himself or herself well prior to 1996. It also enables me to complete the task of leading the parliamentary consultative delegation to Vietnam for the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) which I regard as an issue of very real importance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This insensitivity is similar to the way the ALP simply appointed all its running mates and fellow travellers to the board of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It is similar to the way Senator Bolkus has appointed his wedding party to the Immigration Review Tribunal. The global diversity conference in Sydney in a couple of weeks time is just stacked with Labor Party ministers and parliamentarians. There is very little input from the coalition, except for my colleague Senator Short. I suppose only one of Senator Short's calibre is needed to compete with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and all the other ministers who will be there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Bureau of Immigration Research conference a couple of weeks back, six of the distinguished speakers were disinvited because Minister Bolkus did not like their politics. He tried to get rid of 20 and ended up getting rid of six. He disinvited them. They had been invited and he had the invitations withdrawn. This all demonstrates the same sort of thing. It is all done for the mates and at taxpayers' expense. It is all done to try to give the Labor Party some additional kick along at taxpayers' expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference is about better cities. Senator Bolkus told us what a good program it is. If it is so good, why did the member for Herbert, Mr Ted Lindsay, question better cities expenditure in Townsville? Mr Lindsay accused the Labor council in Townsville of using the money from better cities to do water and sewerage works, which is the normal prerogative and the normal responsibility of local government. Those are the sorts of things that should be done with local government funds, not with special Commonwealth allocations. That is the type of work that local authorities should be funding. All other local authorities have to pay for those things, yet the Townsville Labor council, according to Mr Lindsay, seems to be getting a bit of a kick along in spending better cities program moneys improperly. </PARA>

I am not going to deny that certain individuals on the preliminary speakers list who it was suggested might be invited were then not invited at a later time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inference in that is that all of the people who were disinvited were replaced by Labor mates or by people who were friendly to the government, friendly to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs or friendly to the individual views of Senator Bolkus. Nothing could be further from the truth. Obviously, Senator Macdonald did not read or examine any of the media that came out of that conference. His colleague Senator Short was on the agenda about six times and spoke on numerous occasions, but there was not a great deal of reporting of his comments. From my perspective the major result of the outlook conference&mdash;and I was an attendee and a speaker at the conference&mdash;was those comments attributed to Professor Helen Hughes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, Professor Hughes was not on the original list of speakers, but she was on the amended list.

I am of the opinion that no-one from the opposition has received an invitation to participate in this important conference. If you look at the agenda of the various sessions, as Senator Macdonald has pointed out, there are some 40-odd people participating and presenting papers. The only politicians that are doing so are those of the Labor Party flavour and colour. Many of them are introducing some pretty provocative statements.</PARA></TALK.START>

Ms Jenny Macklin, the endorsed Labor candidate for Jagajaga, is speaking on a major transport paper. Various sessions are being hosted by other backbench MPs.

There is certainly no balance on that agenda or in any of that discussion and that seriously concerns me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, I have concerns about a number of very important questions raised by Senator Macdonald and me in the Senate estimates, both at the original hearings and at the supplementary hearings, relating to housing and urban development matters. It took weeks and weeks for answers to be provided. I think it was a list of some 68 questions that we placed at those supplementary hearings. The answers were delivered to our offices very late last Friday. It is still interesting to look through the list at the questions which have not yet been answered. Yet they are the very points that are now being addressed in this major conference today with this whopping great display all through the Great Hall. All of the areas are a set-up. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a question relating to information on the relationship between the review teams and the advisory groups. I asked a question relating to the involvement of Ms Macklin, the Labor Party endorsed candidate, with the review. I asked when agreement was reached on the winding-up of her consultancy. Senator Macdonald asked about the staffing of the review. There is a further question relating to expenditure review details of AURDR, including allowances for travel, meeting fees, salaries and consultants.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, as Senator Macdonald has said, it is very obviously a stacked conference. A cynical point of view is that it could well be described as a Labor Party marginal seat strategy meeting when it looks at infrastructure. It is not so much the important infrastructure that affects local government, but the infrastructure of how votes will be counted at the next few federal elections. It needs a much more critical view than the patsy and presentational view that Mr Howe would seek to give it by putting together a totally structured and organised committee considering one side of the argument only. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received some information from the Bureau of Resource Sciences with regard to grain coming into this country and how easy it would be for rusts, bunts or smuts, which are all diseases of plants in the various grain production units in this country, to affect grains such as sorghum, wheat, barley and a variety of others. It says quite clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, any dust clouds associated with the loading or unloading of bulk quantities of grain could contain airborne spores such as rust spores.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one example. A very similar situation, although not the same, exists with bunts and smuts. In Australia, we have quite an extensive breeding program, which has led to the development of plants that have some, if not total, resistance to these pathogens. This document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, unlike many other fungal pathogen groups, both the smuts and bunts are characterised by the ability to develop new highly virulent, physiologic strains or forms of the disease each new generation. This is because it involves sexual reproduction and the possible recombination of virulence genes. The progeny from a single generation can differ from each other and from the parent culture in their virulence.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian grain industry's production this year, in the unfortunate and difficult circumstances that Australia now finds itself in because of the drought that has occurred in the grain industry, particularly on the eastern side of the country&mdash;Western Australian grain growers were more fortunate&mdash;is being used to basically fulfil our export obligations. The quality of its product enables the product to be used for purposes other than stock consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the minister treat this particular matter&mdash;and particularly the second part of my question&mdash;more seriously. The long-term damage and cost that could occur to the Australian grain industry has not been overestimated. I understand that there is a method available whereby these diseases can be eliminated. It has been explained to me in layman's terms that it is a steam cleaning process&mdash;in scientific terms it is probably more technical than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By using this process we could make sure, at a relatively low cost of $10 per tonne or a five per cent increase in the price of the product, that these diseases do not come into Australia. There is possibly one downside to this process and that is, as the minister identified, that we could destroy some of the uses for these specialist grains. That being the case, the only option is to bring the grain that is required for those purposes from Western Australia even if it does cost a little more. The long-term damage that could occur to grains, such as barley, sorghum, oats or lupins, from rusts, smuts and bunts could be quite horrendous. I urge the minister to take this matter more seriously than he did today rather than make a personal attack on me and say that, as a wheat grower, I should know what is going on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) has a very difficult decision to make in respect of the standards to be set for imported grains. He made the point today that the grain being imported was sourced from the US central west where there was little risk of pathogens and weeds. He said that was also augmented by pest treatment in the United States and careful control in Australia. We have no history of importing grain into Australia. He said that the final manual will be appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the minister should consider going against the advice of AQIS if it gives the green light to lesser protocols than heat treatment because of the enormous risks and ramifications to the Australian grain industry. Clearly, there will be leakage from trucks. Pathogens are not destroyed by kibbling and can even be transported in dust. Some $10 per tonne is a small price to pay to protect an industry which is absolutely vital and has not had much help, good seasons or good prices for about 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the importation of grain, especially in this case and given that the drought is continuing, because it is not interfering with the local production used for consumption. The drought has had a dramatic effect on grain supply. Over the last 10 years or so we have had a dramatic increase in intensive agriculture. That is certainly the case with feedlots and pork and poultry production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put that into perspective, the winter cereal crop in New South Wales normally amounts to about five million tonnes per year. Last year it was about a million tonnes. In the last 10 years, the increase in usage of feed grain has been five million tonnes. The pressure on domestic grain producers is enormous. People in the industry feel that the intensive livestock industry, especially feedlots, has added about $20 a tonne to domestic grain prices. This could be even higher&mdash;it could be between $60 and $80. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, despite subsidisation from some of our competitors, the import parity price that is applied at the moment is, on the whole, acceptable to the grain industry, especially to those who acknowledge the importance of the intensive livestock industries. But our grain industry needs to have complete protection. For that reason, when the manual is completed as the minister says it will be, he should look very carefully at the issue and not give the green light to the importation of grains without the restriction of heat treatment. In terms of the overall grain industry, it will be a very small price to pay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with both of my colleagues who have already spoken on the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) to Senator Crane's question about the importation of grain. I think the minister said that it is very important that we keep our intensive animal industries going in Australia. We all agree with that. It is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, last year I had a meeting with people from the intensive animal industry in Tamworth. In the Tamworth region, 360,000 tonnes of grain are consumed each year in intensive animal industries. It is very important to that region that we have an intensive animal industry, which includes feedlotting, poultry, pigs, et cetera. It is also very important that we keep our grain industries protected from any of the diseases that may come in. I think some of them have been mentioned already. They include the grey leaf spot, Stewarts wilt, Gosses wilt, the boil smut, Downey mildew, the loose kernel smut and the head smut. All of those come from the southern areas of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said that the government is making sure that the grain comes only from Kansas and Nebraska. But can we be absolutely sure that the containers over there are bringing the correct grain and have been cleaned properly? If the grain is sourced from safe states and treated on the seaboard here, there is not a problem in the world. The problem is when we bring it inland, which we have done in my area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a look at this in Tamworth where the grain is imported. It is brought to Tamworth under a very strict protocol, which includes trucks that are sealed. It is brought to the mill at Tamworth, where there is now an exhaust fan in place to make sure the dust does not get out. It would be so much easier if there were heat-treating for all those grains at the seaboard. Incidentally, I have also had a look at the seaboard at Newcastle to see whether there was any spillage or breaking of the protocol there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the concern of my colleagues and myself is that, if we can make it safer, keep the intensive industries going and not allow anything to cause jeopardy to our very important grain industries, it will be all for the better. Queensland has installed a heat-treating plant. I stand corrected on the figure, but I think it costs $300,000 per heat-treating plant. It is not a fast plant to get things going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government were to put the money into those plants at the seaboard, we would not be concerned with protocols and whether or not we should transport the grain to the country. If any of the dust or diseases get into our grain crops, there will be a bigger problem for the intensive animal industries in the future. One of the most important things is that the two industries work closely together and help each other. If the intensive animal industries have brought in some diseases, it is no good them trying to grind down the prices from the farmers who are producing the grain and, at the same time, expecting grain to be produced the rest of the time, because it will affect both the intensive animal industries and the grain industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the minister disappointed me in his answer when he said that the government is still working out the protocols to secure what is happening and make it even more advantageous to both sides of the industry. The government has had the time to do this since last November when I visited with the minister the people from the intensive animal industries in that region. It is now time that the protocols were got right and we had those heat-treating plants at the seaboard so that grain can be brought in when it needs to be brought in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, there should not be any need to bring in grain, as there is a sorghum crop. I know that a lot of the grain which has been brought in has been rubbish anyway. We should be buying locally produced grain which is of the highest quality and which will remain at the highest quality as long as it does not get any disease. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Creed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your Chairman's letters of 3 February 1995 regarding recent amendments to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Regulations</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Regulations</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Regulations</EMPHASIS> provide for the refund or remission of charges in specified circumstances at the discretion of the Secretary. In the case of the Secretary and representatives of the relevant industry groups not agreeing on the refund or remission arrangements, the Secretary has full discretion as to the course of action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Secretary is under no legal obligation to refund or remit over-recovered revenue. The discretionary power gives the Secretary the necessary flexibility to treat each case on its merits and allows factors such as previous years recovery and AQIS's financial position to be considered. In all cases to date, the Commonwealth has reached agreement with industry groups on the format of any refunds or remissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Industry Charging Review Committees consulted regarding arrangements for any refund or remission of charges are, as far as possible, representative of all relevant industry groups. AQIS's impartial role in administering the Committees ensures that the interests of all persons affected by a decision, but who are not directly involved with the industry group, are considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amended regulation is not capable of differential application. Any decision to remit or refund charges after consultation with relevant industry groups will be uniformly applied across a program. Any move to differential application would require legislative amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the amendment to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Regulations</EMPHASIS>, AQIS has decreased the quantity charge for inspection of bulk grain exports to reflect the reduced AQIS costs and increased industry activity in this program. The same charges were increased significantly in 1989 as part of AQIS's move from 50% to 60% cost recovery. As part of the Government's program of micro-economic reform, AQIS later moved to 100% cost recovery from 1 January 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current reduction in costs is the result of the implementation of the Government's reform package for AQIS announced late in 1993.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 28 February 1995 concerning recent amendments to the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Regulations (Statutory Rules No 369 of 1994). These amendments provide for the refund or remission of charges in specified circumstances at the discretion of the Secretary. The Committee has previously corresponded with you on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before concluding the matter, the Committee, at its meeting on 2 March 1995, resolved that it would appreciate some further information on the detail of the process by which these refunds will be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposed new subregulation 6(8) refers to situations where "a person" is liable to pay a charge. This would suggest that refunds are to occur on a case-by-case basis. You seem to allude to this in your letter of 28 February, where you indicate that the proposed procedure permits the Secretary to treat each case on its merits. But applying refunds on a case-by-case basis also suggests that they may be applied on a differential basis, with the amount of any refund depending on the person paying, and the amount of, the charge. Alternatively, refunds may be applied to a class of persons, in which case it is less likely that they will be applied differently within that class.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would, therefore, appreciate some further detail on how charges will be refunded. For example, is it envisaged that the Secretary would, at some point in a financial year, determine that surplus moneys existed; that these should be remitted; and, following consultations with representative organisations, that all those who had paid an establishment registration charge would be entitled to receive a refund of a set percentage of that charge?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Committee would appreciate some elaboration on how the "impartial role" of AQIS in administering the Industry Review Committees ensures that the interests of those not directly represented on those Committees are considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In your letter, you note that, in all cases to date, agreement has been reached with industry groups on the format of any refunds. As the current procedure seems to be operating effectively, could you also advise the Committee of the reasons for the new regulatory powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, could I draw to your attention a small but significant typographical error in Note 2 to the amending regulation. This Note, which lists all amendments to the primary regulations, refers to amendments made by Statutory Rules No 374 of 1993. This should be a reference to Statutory Rules No 376 of 1993.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mal,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 2 March 1995 regarding recent amendments to the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Regulations which provide for the refund or remission of charges in specified circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The confusion which still remains about the purpose and application of the amendments could probably best be resolved by providing the committee with some further background information and a practical example of how the amendments are being applied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are the mechanism which allows the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) to return revenue which is surplus to cost recovery requirements to its clients. A similar provision was added to the Quarantine Act 1908 by amendment in late 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount of surplus revenue is determined once AQIS financial statements for the year are finalised. The 1993/94 financial year was the first in which AQlS's financial reporting was in sufficient detail to analyse the cost recovery performance of each commodity group. It was also the first financial year in which AQIS operated under accrual accounting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In determining the most appropriate method for returning surplus revenue, AQIS has sought agreement with the relevant industry consultative committees. The industry consultative committees are the established fora for discussions with industry regarding cost recovery arrangements. The industry representatives are drawn from all sectors of that industry. Each affected industry group has been given the opportunity through the consultative process to recommend a process by which funds would be returned to that group of AQIS clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of the fishing industry, AQIS advised the Fishing Industry Advisory Committee (FIAC) that there was surplus revenue of approximately $666,000 from 1993/94. FIAC advised that the industry's preferred method of retuning funds was through a partial rebate of a set percentage of annual registration charges in the subsequent year and a product testing program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former is being achieved through the remission powers contained in subregulations 6 (8) and (9), the latter by administrative arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS has administered this process in an impartial way by ensuring that industry proposals for the return of surplus funds benefit all participants in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current procedure, which you have referred to as operating effectively, has been possible because of the new regulatory powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the typographical error in Note 2 of the amending regulations, I am advised by the Office of Legislative Drafting that the error has no legal bearing and that the necessary correction will be made at the first appropriate opportunity.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes to Rule 51 of the Deed authorise the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to approve payment of part of the employer benefit included in the preserved benefitee "because of particular circumstances".

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 3 February 1995 concerning the Military Superannuation and Benefits Trust Deed (Amendment) (No 2 of 1994) made under section 5 of the Military Superannuation and Benefits (MSB) Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of your enquiries related to the review processes available to applicants where the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner exercises his discretion in respect of the partial release of preserved superannuation employer benefits. My Department sought the advice of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) on this matter and that advice forms the basis of my comments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The MSB scheme is currently subject to the standards imposed by the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 (OSSA) and its regulations. These standards place restrictions on the early release of benefits to ensure that superannuation benefits are preserved for use in a person's retirement. However, there will be circumstances in which an applicant might be able to access the benefit before retirement and OSSA provides for this by allowing the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner the discretion to determine circumstances for the early release of the benefit. He will consider such an early release on the grounds of severe financial hardship or for compassionate reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An application for early release where a person is experiencing severe financial hardship would normally be approved by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner where there are no assets which could reasonably be used, in the next six months, to cover the gap between personal income and expenses associated with the basic necessities of every day living other than by making use of the preserved superannuation benefit. Where financial difficulties have arisen because of compulsive behaviour patterns, such as gambling, an application would generally not be approved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In exceptional circumstances release of a benefit may be approved on compassionate grounds by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner notwithstanding that the applicant is not in severe financial hardship. For example, where the applicant can establish, with documentary evidence, that he or she is unable to obtain finances from other sources or the applicant is suffering a terminal illness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review process for assessing the release of preserved employer benefits was revised by the ISC in 1993, along with other aspects of the function, including the development of a revised application form. These developments were undertaken in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner and the Commonwealth Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ISC has implemented and is operating a two tiered internal review system in relation to its decisions of this kind under OSSA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original decision to release preserved benefits (or otherwise) is made following application to either the Sydney or Melbourne offices of the ISC. The officers making these decisions rely on a set of internal guidelines. Successful applicants are notified by letter, usually without explanation of the decision. Unsuccessful applicants are provided  with a notification which explains why the application was unsuccessful and advises that the decision can be reviewed if the applicant is dissatisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a review was requested, it would be undertaken by an ISC officer in the same office who had no involvement in the decision. Similarly, if the outcome of the review confirms the original decision, the applicant is advised of the reasons for the review decision. The applicant would also be informed of the availability of the second review option which is an appeal lodged with the Appeals Section in the ISCs Canberra office. Applicants who are unsuccessful in this second review are again informed of the reasons and also advised of their right to refer the matter to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also requested advice on the amendment by the Instrument of the Trust Deed to insert a new Schedule 4A. That Schedule provides for the calculation of the Notional Employer Benefit by reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) published by the Statistician.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 2 of Schedule 4A to the Trust Deed contains the operative reference to the CPI. The relevant provision in Clause 2 is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"2. (1) A person's notional employer benefit is taken to have increased in a financial year (in this clause called the `relevant year'):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) if the all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of the year immediately preceding the relevant year exceeds the highest all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of any earlier year (except a year earlier than the year that commenced on I July 1989); and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) in the circumstances described in paragraph (a)&mdash;by an amount equal to the prescribed percentage of the person's notional employer benefit as at the end of the previous financial year."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your letter referred to the Committee's 1993-94 Annual Report, in which the Committee expressed the view that, where regulations made under one Act defined a matter in relation to a register kept under another Act, "the incorporation would be valid only if it referred to the register as existing when the regulations were made".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context, the Committee asked for advice as to the effect of section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act on the validity of the reference in Schedule 4A to the CPI increases published by the Statistician. Section 49A would prevent the Instrument incorporating "an instrument or other writing as in force or existing from time to time".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General's Department has advised that Clause 2 of Schedule 4A is not affected by section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General's Department is of the view that the result of the Statistician's activities in ascertaining and publishing the periodical variations that have occurred in the CPI cannot be characterised as "an instrument or other writing as in force or existing from time to time" or as having any parallel to a register. The Attorney-General's Department's view is that the true character of those activities seems to be the periodic recognition, by scientific (statistical) means, of observable facts and the public reporting of those facts in, essentially, an isolated notice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General's Department has concluded that the fact that the Trust Deed refers to more than one CPI figure does not affect that view: that is, the figures do not link as an instrument or other writing as in force or existing from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of this advice, the reference in the Instrument to the CPI increases is considered valid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that these comments have met the Committee's concerns.</PARA>

<PARA>A spate of phone calls from distressed and disillusioned officials from a number of benevolent institutions a few months back complaining of the moral bankruptcy of the Australian government through the Australian Taxation Office not refunding overpaid sales tax prompted my private senator's bill presented today. Evidently, a decree must have gone out because of the need to maximise tax receipts to hold overpaid sales tax payments in circumstances where an exempt body has overpaid sales tax. Upon inquiry, I was advised that there was no legislative mechanism to permit a credit or refund, so the ATO was entitled to keep the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Sales Tax Assessment (Refunds for Certain Public Interest and Charitable Bodies) Amendment Bill is to provide a legislative framework to allow certain public interest and charitable bodies to claim a refund of sales tax under sales tax law. As we all know, exempt bodies do not have to pay sales tax. Exempt bodies previously not entitled to a credit but benefiting from this bill would be, as taken from the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992, public hospitals; a hospital carried on by a non-profit body; a public benevolent institution; a public body that is established and maintained principally for the relief of unemployed persons; charitable fundraising bodies; medical research bodies; accident prevention bodies; infant-welfare bodies; bodies established in Australia solely for public purposes; a non-profit body established and maintained principally for religious, philosophical, educational, scientific or literary purposes, or for the encouragement or advancement of fine arts; armed forces support bodies; and public zoos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In ordinary circumstances, where an amount is collected in excess of what is agreed, a refund would be regarded as a natural entitlement. The surprising thing is that I am not referring to an isolated event. Therefore, the government, having been advised some time ago of this hole in the legislation, should have rectified the defect. It is anathema for good professional tax officers having to enforce bad law or a law which produces situations of injustice or results from what I am sure must be unintended consequences. The amendments I am presenting to this Senate are therefore an equity or a justice issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to reduce the acute distress being experienced by thousands of people living around Sydney's Kingsford-Smith Airport (KSA), and to put a halt to the Government's plans to increase their distress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes two measures&mdash;-to extend and strengthen the KSA curfew, and to freeze the rate of aircraft movements while a Commission of Inquiry is conducted under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. It amends the Air Navigation Act 1920, and through the act amends the Air Navigation (Aerodrome Curfew) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As is well known, the curfew which operates at KSA has been eroded under strong pressure, particularly from the airline industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nominal curfew hours have contracted to the present 11pm to 6am, which simply does not provide noise-affected residents with enough rest time. A seven-hour curfew is particularly inadequate to meet the sleeping patterns of children and the sick. I have heard stories of children who go to bed at 8.30pm only to be woken up two hours later, and have had many complaints from people being prematurely woken as the noise bombardment begins at 6am.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is plenty of evidence of serious health problems arising from aircraft noise in Sydney, and the inadequacy of the curfew is a major cause of those. This bill proposes to extend the curfew by an hour&mdash;-so that it operates from 10.30pm to 6.30am and alleviates the noise burden to a significant degree. This is particularly important given that the noise abatement measures which are supposed to make life tolerable for people under the flight paths&mdash;-and there is room for doubt about that&mdash;-will not be implemented for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The erosion of the curfew has also occurred in the area of exemptions. International flights are allowed to use KSA in the hour after the curfew starts and the hour before it ends. A number of freight aircraft movements are permitted throughout the curfew period, propellor aircraft have a blanket exemption, and the Minister can issue other permits if he sees fit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result has been that people near the southern flight paths could be forgiven for seeing this as a Clayton's curfew&mdash;-the curfew you have went you don't have a curfew. While it is true that there are fewer flights on more resident-friendly flight paths, the impact of the noise is magnified by our social and biological expectations that night is a quiet time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill abolishes the Department of Transport's discretion to exempt international carriers from the curfew, and repeals the exemptions for freight jets. It turns the Clayton's curfew into a credible curfew.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not to say that exemptions should never be granted. Clearly if a certain type of low-noise aircraft is able to use KSA during curfew hours without causing significant distress to affected residents, then an exemption could be considered. However, our bill would limit the granting of exemptions to the Minister, and not his Department, and would give either House of Parliament the power of veto. A very convincing case would have to be made before any exemption would be allowed to stand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second part of the bill is a response to the Government's extraordinary proposal to increase the rate of aircraft movements from the present 55 per hour to 65 by the middle of the year, and 80 by the end, as air traffic controllers become more familiar with the new control tower.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is one conclusion which can be drawn from the aircraft noise debate over the last few months, it is that community reaction to the new flight paths was seriously underestimated in the Environmental Impact Statement on the parallel runway. The Australian Noise Exposure Forecast system is a useful guide to zoning around a greenfields airport site, but it is much less useful in predicting the reaction of an existing community which has had a new noise burden foisted upon it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The weakness of the EIS is hardly surprising when you consider just how flawed and biased the process is. You can't expect the proponent of a project to write an objective assessment of the environmental impacts, but that is exactly what the EIS process requires them to do. It has always been a fraud and is long overdue for reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What this means is that there has not been a credible and independent assessment of the noise impacts of the Government's plans for KSA, despite the effect they will have on thousands of people. The interests of the airline industry should not be met by destroying people's home lives and avoiding due process, but that is what is happening here. If the noise problems seem bad now with 55 aircraft movements per hour, just imagine how bad they'll be at 80.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats recognise that the Minister for Transport is accelerating measures to reduce the noise. But the fact is that the full benefits are a long way off, and there is serious doubt that they will be enough. Basic fairness dictates that consideration of any further increase in the noise burden is out of the question until there has been a proper inquiry, and a new set of noise standards which meet general community acceptance are in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If further increases in aircraft movements can be made compatible with the new standards, then we would consider that. If not&mdash;-and in my view this is more likely&mdash;-then the cap remains in place and there is no choice but to make Badgery's Creek Sydney's primary airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation therefore restricts the maximum rate of aircraft movements to the present level of 55. It prevents any increase unless three stringent conditions are met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, there must have been a Commission of Inquiry to assess the environmental impacts, including the noise impacts, of the proposed increase. A Commission of Inquiry is powerful, and it is independent. It is the highest form of environmental assessment available in Australia, and can be established by the Minister for Environment under section 11 of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, the Government must have finalised an environmental management plan, including a noise management plan, which is consistent with the Commission's findings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, both Houses of Parliament must have given their approval to the proposed increase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This establishes the proper processes which should have been implemented in the first place before the parallel runway was built instead of fast-tracking Badgery's Creek. It puts people before aircraft, and deserves the full support of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Childs</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am responding on behalf of the Government to the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fisheries Reviewed</EMPHASIS> by the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to congratulate both you and the Committee for the comprehensive approach taken in addressing the inquiry's terms of reference. I see from the report that you held 13 public hearings, received 41 submissions and took evidence from around 90 witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Committee's review is welcome in that it identified areas where Commonwealth fisheries management can be improved. Matters that I believe have been usefully identified for the attention of Government include such issues as fishing access rights, industry adjustment options, how industry members are appointed to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority's (AFMA) Management Advisory Committees, improvements in consultative arrangements with the people of Lord Howe Island, the adequacy of search warrants, the adequacy of penalties for infringements of fisheries regulations and how AFMA might improve the presentation of its financial data to make it more useful to industry and Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some recommendations made by the Committee are also matters which are constantly being monitored and improved by AFMA as it develops new plans of management under the Fisheries Management Act 1991. Issues such as fairness and equity in dealing with fishermen, how best to deal with bycatch and overcatch, progress on the Offshore Constitutional Settlement arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States and catch verification procedures used by processors, are matters of on-going improvement and, as such, do not require new decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some recommendations have been overtaken by events. For example, the suggestion about making conditions similar to those in the States for obtaining search warrants will now be addressed by bringing fisheries legislation into line with the Commonwealth's Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994 which came into force on 1 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In drawing together this response, the National Fishing Industry Council, AFMA, CSIRO and State/Territory fisheries departments have provided comment on the Committee's recommendations. Ministers of departments that would be directly affected by changes to Commonwealth fisheries legislation have been consulted. I believe that the response represents a well balanced reply to your Committee's report.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">INTRODUCTION</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report on the adequacy of Commonwealth fisheries legislation (in particular the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 and the Fisheries Management Act 1991) contains 46 recommendations. In many instances the matters raised are those where on-going review and improvement is in place as part of progressive fisheries management. Nonetheless, there are 11 recommendations where the Government agrees that new action would be of benefit to the fisheries under its jurisdiction. Below is the Government's consideration and position on each recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Chapter 3: AFMA's approach to fisheries management</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION  1</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NFIC sought the inclusion of an additional objective, `the restoration of viability to the commercial fishing industry', noting that AFMA recognised the importance of achieving this in its interim corporate plan. The Committee considers that the suggestions made by NFIC have merit and recommends that they be further considered by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. (Paragraph 3.18)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is strongly supportive of a viable commercial fishing industry. However, the specific inclusion in legislation of the additional objective `the restoration of viability to the commercial fishing industry' is considered unnecessary as this issue is already covered by the existing objective `maximising economic efficiency in the exploitation of fisheries resources'. As AFMA is already required to seek to `maximise economic efficiency . . . . ` AFMA is already addressing the problems of excess fishing capacity in its fisheries through the MAC process where industry is well represented. This, in turn, should lead to restoration of viability for the fishing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the recommendation is not supported, the Government believes its intent is covered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION  2</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee . . . recommends that AFMA's objectives be listed in order of importance in the Act, and that the Act be amended to reflect this. (Paragraph 3.19)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's opinion that the objectives in the 1991 fisheries legislation should be viewed as an overall package rather than as a set hierarchy. Fisheries management plans are an integrated package of measures designed to achieve long term sustainable and efficient use of resources in a manner consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. No two management plans are the same and at different times in their implementation the emphasis on certain objectives will vary. Fisheries managers need the flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and a hierarchy of objectives could, at times, stymie this flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation is not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION  3</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that ultimately the decision [regarding input and output controls] must be made on two principal criteria&mdash;cost and effectiveness in ensuring fisheries remain sustainable for the future. (Paragraph 3.29)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government acknowledges the importance of both criteria (cost and effectiveness) in determining the use of input and output controls in fisheries management. The Government notes that this view parallels much more closely the approach that AFMA has now adopted. Furthermore, AFMA is very conscious that a number of other factors need also to be considered when determining the use of input or output controls in fisheries management such as whether:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">there is broad industry support;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the fishery is managed under a single jurisdiction;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">there has been sufficient stock assessment to permit the setting of responsible total allowable catches (TACs);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">all gear sectors (including foreign operators and recreational interests where applicable) should be included in the management arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">there can be equitable allocations; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">there exists satisfactory by-catch, high grading, monitoring and surveillance measures, as well as effective enabling legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFMA is now implementing this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Chapter Four: Property rights under the Commonwealth fisheries management act</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION  4</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers it is likely that the property rights issue has the potential to involve the Commonwealth and fishers in expensive litigation for some time to come. The Committee therefore concludes that an urgent re-examination of the approach to the property rights question in the Management Act should be undertaken. It believes that had the property rights issue been approached with more regard to fairness and equity, a number of the present difficulties and much of the litigation could have been avoided. (Paragraph 4.15)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government fully supports the principles of fairness and equity in making decisions, particularly those that impact on the livelihood of individuals. It should be noted that all the current property rights litigation relates to licences under the Fisheries Act 1952. A decision by the full bench of the Federal Court, subsequent to the finalisation of the Committee's report, has reduced the incentive to litigate on property rights. The Federal Court ruled that fishing access rights may be withdrawn in the valid exercise of powers under fisheries legislation, without the payment of compensation. The relevant provisions of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 reflect this position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's policy statement New Directions for Commonwealth Fisheries Management in the 1990s (1989) made it clear that fish stocks are a community owned resource and, therefore, a role for government is to allocate access to fisheries resources in order to ensure that they are not over-exploited and that they are used as efficiently as possible to maximise benefits to the industry and the nation. Section 22 of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 provides the conditions under which AFMA is to establish and administer a system of statutory fishing rights in accordance with a plan of management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising the concerns of the fishing industry on this matter, the Government has re-examined, with assistance from industry representatives and AFMA, the matter of fishing access rights. Amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 are to be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION  5</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the current financial circumstances of some small operators in the SEF, the Committee recommends that AFMA, in close consultation with SETMAC, re-examine the process of allocating quota in the SEF with the objective of ensuring all participants, including long term, smaller scale operators, are dealt with in a manner which is fair and equitable. It further recommends that AFMA and SETMAC explore all options for adjustment in the SEF and adopt a flexible approach in determining the best use of the NFAP account, which may include some form of buy-out of operators holding small amounts of quota. (Paragraph 4.40)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SEF quota allocation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would appear that some complaints by fishermen about lack of fairness and equity primarily relate to the manner in which initial quota allocations were made when output controls were introduced into this fishery in 1991. That was prior to the establishment of AFMA. It has subsequently been determined by the courts that the initial allocative mechanism was flawed. AFMA has since made substantial progress in redressing this issue. Extensive reviews of the allocation provisions in the SEF have been conducted by a number of different bodies over recent years and it is the Government's view that further reviews of the allocation provisions would result in even more instability and uncertainty in the fishery and would serve no practical purpose for the fishery overall.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFMA is fully aware that if output controls are to be introduced in a fishery then there should be broad prior agreement with industry on the mechanism to allocate the quota in the first instance. Working within the constraint of a sustainable TAC, industry will need to be instrumental in deciding on the agreed mechanism prior to new arrangements being implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFMA is very aware that it cannot responsibly increase TACs for the SEF unless stock assessments clearly indicate that it is possible and responsible to do so. If there is no increase in TACs, increased quota allocations to some operators would need to be offset by reductions in the allocations to others. Any such action would almost certainly result in a new round of litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1993, prior to the release of the Committee's report, AFMA agreed to full transferability of quotas in the SEF which will assist those operators wishing to adjust their quota holdings. This decision has met with general acceptance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that the development of a management plan under the Fisheries Management Act 1991 requires extensive consultative processes be undertaken and that quota holders may have the quantum of statutory fishing rights granted to them under such a plan reviewed by the Statutory Fishing Rights Allocation Review Panel. AFMA is currently developing such a management plan for the SEF. This process will ensure that the management arrangements in the fishery are open to both wide public and industry consultation and to the existing review mechanisms in the 1991 legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising the principles of fairness and equity the Government, through AFMA, is continuing to address these issues as it develops the SEF management plan under the Fisheries Management Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NFAP account</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to the Committee's recommendation that some form of buy-out be investigated, AFMA has held discussions with representatives of the NSW Commercial Fishing Advisory Council on possible adjustment options. In addition, SETMAC has considered adjustment options for those operators who received relatively small initial allocations when management arrangements were changed from a unit system to the present quota system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is continuing to examine, with input from AFMA, SETMAC and industry meetings, all adjustment options for this fishery including the possible use of the NFAP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION  6</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee reiterates that AFMA must always seek to apply the principles of fairness and equity when management decisions about fisheries are taken. The costs of litigation mean that justice can be very difficult to obtain for those operators who lack the financial resources to mount court challenges. The Committee therefore recommends that AFMA develop and implement a code of practice to be adopted with respect to their dealings with fishers. This code must incorporate the principles of fair and open dealing, just compensation when required, and industry consultation on all major decisions. (Paragraph 4.47)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that the principles of fairness and equity must apply to fisheries management decisions and that there is industry consultation on all major decisions. These principles are embodied in the provisions of the Commonwealth Administrative  Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the Fisheries Management Act 1991. In addition, the Government's Social Justice Strategy is built on the application of the principles of equity, equality, access and participation in such matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992, AFMA established a code of conduct embracing the concepts of fairness and equity. The code sets out the standard of behaviour expected of AFMA staff with the objective of providing a service to the fishing industry and the community in general which is efficient, fair, impartial and honest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While every effort is made to avoid litigation to resolve differences, it is recognised that individuals will always have the right to seek a Court decision on their particular circumstances. Court decisions, the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the distribution of an AFMA code of conduct should provide a firm basis for AFMA and industry to reach balanced agreement on management issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, a paper outlining the obligations and responsibilities of MAC industry members has been produced and is provided to members prior to their appointment to a MAC. All new MAC members are required to formally advise that they have read and understood the relevant sections of the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 dealing with Management Advisory Committees and the paper `MAC Industry Members&mdash;Obligations and Responsibilities'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is supported and has been implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION  7</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee further recommends that where questions about the application of the principles of equity and fairness in determining access to a fishery are raised, these matters should be referred to MACs for mediation. Litigation should be used by either party only as a final resort. (Paragraph 4.48)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government fully supports the notion that litigation should be used only as a final resort. However, the role of a MAC is appropriately `advisory' and the MAC's function is to develop management options for the fishery. A MAC would then be expected to work towards resolving any conflicts with the objective of arriving at what could be truly seen as an agreed position that is fair and equitable, prior to making recommendations to the AFMA Board. The Government agrees that MACs are the most appropriate bodies to advise on such matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, experience has shown that situations will arise where a MAC may not be able to reach an agreed decision. Under these circumstances, AFMA is obliged to make the final decision on what it considers to be in the best interests of the fishery as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation is not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Chapter Five: A greater role for MACs</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATIONS  8 AND 9</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION  8</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the title of MACs in the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 be changed to Management Committees to reflect their changed status. (Paragraph 5.12)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION  9</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also recommends that changes be made to the</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Management Act to reflect the altered status and roles of the Committees where required. (Paragraph 5.13)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the concept of greater industry involvement in the direct management of individual fisheries. Indeed, the provisions relating to management advisory committees (sections 56 to 67 of the Fisheries Administration Act 1991) clearly envisage a gradual devolution of decision making responsibilities to individual MACs. As appropriate, Commonwealth fisheries management will evolve in this direction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee drew attention to the extent of industry involvement in the management of the Spencer Gulf prawn fishery in South Australia. However, the Spencer Gulf fishery is unique in that it is single species, is in a relatively confined area and has a small number of operators with close family and community links. It must also be recognised that even in this fishery ultimate responsibility still rests with the South Australian Department of Primary Industries and its Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most importantly, the Government is concerned about the impact that implementation of this recommendation could have with respect to AFMA's responsibilities to the Minister and to Parliament, and on the capacity of AFMA directors to fulfil their statutory obligations. Implementation of recommendations 8 and 9 would virtually create a series of `mini-AFMAs' each responsible for an individual fishery, but not directly responsible to either the Minister or Parliament. AFMA, on the other hand, would still have nominal responsibility for ensuring the objectives of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 are met and would be responsible for reporting to the Minister and Parliament, but would have only limited decision making power. Such a change would break the vital nexus between decision making and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In consultations with State and Territory governments, there was little support for these two recommendations. Indeed, some States correctly observed that it is vital that effective links are in place between jurisdictions to ensure that management of State and Commonwealth fisheries does not diverge and lead to unacceptable outcomes. The Government believes that this can best be achieved by the States working with a single Commonwealth management agency rather than with a number of Management Committees (MC).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An additional concern is that of funding for AFMA if its MACs were to take on the responsibility envisaged by this recommendation. For Government related work, MCs might need to be directly funded from the Budget. Accountability to Government of both AFMA and the new MCs would then become an issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendations 8 and 9 are not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION  10</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has considered the issue of MAC membership. It recommends the following amendments to s62 of the Administration Act:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">industry representatives on the Management Committees be appointed through a democratic process to be determined by the Minister;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the AFMA board's right to veto industry appointments be removed. (Paragraph 5.14)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation raises issues of social justice and, in-principle, the Government supports the notion of democratic processes and will explore all practical options for consideration. However, the Government remains aware of the need for  MAC members to bring with them certain expertise as well as a requirement to represent the best interests of the fishery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will take up these issues with both AFMA and industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION  11</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee . . . recommends that AFMA be required to closely monitor the activities of the Management Committees, negotiate performance indicators with them and report back to the Parliament on the operation of the new provisions in its annual report. (Paragraph 5.16)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the Government's response to recommendations 8 and 9 above, this recommendation requires no action. However, AFMA already closely monitors the performance of its MACs. Each MAC is now required to prepare a strategic plan which will include appropriate performance indicators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No action is required on this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Chapter Six: Jurisdiction over fisheries</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION  12</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that AFMA establish a forum consisting of industry and scientific advisers to develop options for the logical and scientifically valid division of the SEF. As a minimum requirement, a way should be found to separate the highly specialised deep water operators from the other parts of the fishery. (Paragraph 6.27)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The future division of jurisdictional responsibility in the SEF is currently being discussed as part of the Offshore Constitutional Settlement (OCS) arrangements between the Commonwealth and the relevant States.  Among other things, fish should be managed on the basis of stocks; lines on the water that subdivide stocks should be avoided. Consideration of this issue under the OCS arrangements is being undertaken in the light of the best available scientific, economic and social data in consultation with industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent freeing up of restrictions on quota transfers in the SEF is expected, over time, to have a major impact on rationalising the fishery. Those with big boats better suited to deep water operation are expected to aggregate quota for deep water species and possibly to sell quota for other species. Smaller boat operators are expected to do the opposite. This market driven rationalisation will help produce a more effective and efficient division of the fishery than could be obtained by administrative decision alone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intent of this recommendation is accepted. However, in this case OCS arrangements and quota negotiability are the Government's preferred options.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION  13</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee . . . recommends that all Commonwealth licensed vessels, regardless of history, be excluded from the twelve mile zone [of Lord Howe Island]. (Paragraph 6.43)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFMA originally proposed a complete closure of 12 nml radius of Lord Howe Island and Balls Pyramid to all operators. AFMA wrote to all holders of line Fishing Permits with access to the area, NSW Fisheries, and NSW Commercial Fishing Advisory Council on 1 April 1993 seeking comments on the proposal. Responses were received from individual fishermen, NSW Fisheries, the CFAC and the National Fishing Industry Council pointing out that a number of operators had `traditionally' fished in the waters of the proposed closure and that their circumstances should be considered when implementing such a closure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFMA considered there was a sound case for continued access by line operators who had a documented history of fishing in the area in the previous three years. Only one fisherman fell into this category and he continues to operate in the exclusion area. All evidence regarding the catch taken from inside the exclusion area suggests that this operator is fishing a virgin stock and that there is no threat to sustainability of stocks by allowing this operation to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is of the view that to terminate this licence, or to subject it to special conditions, could be a denial of natural justice. Action to restrict this single operator's access could precipitate expensive litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under these circumstances, the recommendation is not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION  14</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recognises that this recommendation may be viewed by some as a possible method of evading catch restrictions, particularly if there is a perception that the bycatch provisions can be used as a fallback position to escape prosecution when a catch is subjected to inspection. This is not the Committee's intention. It therefore further recommends that stringent penalties be applied for failure to declare bycatch, including forfeiture of quota and gear. (Paragraph 7.44)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendations 28 to 32 all relate to the management of bycatch and overcatch. The Government is fully aware of the problems and complexity of issues surrounding these matters and concurs with the Committee that both bycatch and overcatch must be minimised. To this end the Government sees merit in encouraging operators to land all marketable fish where this does not contravene State and/or Commonwealth law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Developing options to resolve these issues is best left to fisheries managers, fisheries scientists, fisheries economists and the industry itself. To this extent, AFMA and its MACs are thoroughly examining all possible options, including those suggested in recommendations 28 to 32, with a view to improving the management arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFMA is consulting with industry through the MAC process on how to reduce the incidence of dumping and high grading. It is seeking to provide more flexibility to operators to account for bycatch and over catch without undermining the integrity of the quota management system.  In 1994 AFMA implemented, on a trial basis, arrangements to deduct up to 10 percent of an operator's quota to take account of overcatch from the previous season. Overcatch by an operator as a result of the last trip of the year, as noted by the Committee, would be taken into account under this arrangement, providing that the extent of the year's overcatch was no greater than 10 per cent of the operator's quota. The arrangement has been renewed for 1995 but at the 20 percent level of variation. On bycatch and overcatch in general, the Government supports, in-principle, the collection of all data but notes that enforcement of such a provision would prove extremely expensive and, be well nigh impossible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>It is almost a year to the day since this report was presented to the Senate. From my short time in this place, three years, it would seem to me that a year is an extraordinarily long time for a government to respond to a report from a Senate standing committee, particularly a report as important as this report into the adequacy of the fisheries legislation, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fisheries reviewed</EMPHASIS>. In the letter to Senator Childs, who was chairman of the committee at the time this inquiry was conducted, the Minister for Resources highlights the amount of time that was taken in compiling this report and the fact that evidence was taken at 13 public hearings from around 90 witnesses. Senator Coulter was a part of that inquiry for some of the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a very important inquiry which covered a large range of issues. We as a committee finally came up with unanimous recommendations as to what we felt should take place in the fishing industry. The recommendations covered all sorts of matters, such as the management advisory committees, the resources, the stocks, and how the fishing industry could best be administered. We made some very important recommendations in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fisheries reviewed. </EMPHASIS>Having taken 12 months almost to the day for the government to respond to that report, I was very concerned to find the following amongst the responses to the various recommendations. In recommendation 10 the committee considered the issue of the management advisory committee membership. At the end it says that the government will take up these issues with both the AFMA and the industry. After 12 months of the report having been lodged in the Senate I would have hoped that the government would have done more than just consider taking up these issues; I would have hoped it would have already taken them up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also spent considerable time dealing with some of the specific problems that confront Lord Howe Island. I was disappointed to note that in the government's response some of the recommendations which were unanimous by the committee were not supported by the government, particularly in relation to the complete closure around places such as Balls Pyramid and Lord Howe Island in general. That was recommended for the protection of the fish stocks in those areas on behalf of the people on Lord Howe Island who particularly rely on fishing for their survival and as the source for much of the food for the tourist operations that Lord Howe Island is so well known for. So I am disappointed that in relation to many of those recommendations the government has not supported the people on Lord Howe Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the government says recommendation 17, which deals with offshore arrangements and jurisdictional arrangements, is being supported and implemented, it seems to me there is certainly a long way to go. Recommendation 24 talks about legal advice with regard to paper trails and how we can somehow improve the situation within the industry. We have recommended that AFMA seek advice on how the problem may be addressed. The government's response is that the recommendation is supported and the government will seek advice on this important issue. It now being 12 months after the report was adopted by the Senate, I would have thought that it is time for the government to be doing more than just talking about seeking advice. I would have hoped that that advice had already been sought and the recommendations put into place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to take up much of the Senate's time today, but I would just like to say that I am disappointed with this response. I know that it has taken 12 months, almost to the day, for the government to respond to a report that has a significant number of recommendations. People in the fishing industry have been very concerned because some of the recommendations concerned major issues to do with management advisory committees, with total allowable catch quotas and with jurisdictional matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am pleased that the government has responded to many of the recommendations and has put them in place, I think some of the more difficult issues have been left aside. I hope that, in relation to the recommendations where we see the government has responded `we will seek advice', `it is being implemented' or `at some stage in the future, it may implement the recommendation', the government will very quickly act on the recommendations that are in that report for the benefit of the people whom we were trying to make sure are looked after: those involved in the fishing industry, which is so important to this nation of ours. </PARA>

There is no doubt that we are managing the fish stocks of Australia very poorly indeed, and there is no doubt that that is part of a pattern of poor management throughout the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years, the fish garnered from the oceans have declined. Many of the fish stocks are in a very parlous state indeed. When the legislation to which this report refers first came before the Senate, the committee to which Senator Ferguson referred reviewed a package of legislation which set up AFMA in the first place. As a result of the very extensive committee deliberations, if I recall correctly, some 83 or 86 amendments got into that package of legislation. The working of the legislation was then reviewed, and it is the government's response to that review that we are now looking at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is still, as I indicated earlier, very unsatisfactory. It seems as though a few fisheries in Australia are being managed on a sustainable basis, but many of the fisheries certainly are a long way from that. In addition to that, we recently laid claim to the 200 nautical miles around Australia. The day that that was announced Minister Cook spoke in over-optimistic terms about the ability to exploit the northern tuna across Australia, yet we had CSIRO scientists telling us that we knew virtually nothing about the fish stocks, about the life cycle of those fish, about their migratory habits and so on. We have a government that is hellbent on repeating the mistakes of the past without adequately doing research. CSIRO went on to point out that it needed some $100 million in additional funding to carry out research work adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days I have advertised for a two-day a week position in my office. One of the applicants for that position is a former CSIRO scientist and an expert on fisheries research&mdash;a man with three pages of publications to his name&mdash;who has remained unemployed for 12 years. We have a number of these highly qualified people around Australia who could help us in this work, and yet we find the government is very stingy with the resource backing required to carry out this research work&mdash;research work on which the proper management of our fisheries would be based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I looked at the amount of money Australia is spending on research generally. Australia is spending 1.3 per cent of GDP compared with 2.6 per cent for the United States of America. Even South Korea is spending five per cent of GDP on research. In view of the fact that the budget is coming up, the plea I make to the government is that scientific research generally is an area that needs a great deal more support and the fishing area specifically needs a great deal more research effort, particularly with respect to the ignorance regarding the 200 nautical miles around Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>Senators will recall that in 1993 as a result of action that I instigated in the Senate estimates process an Auditor-General's report was called for and commissioned by the minister and subsequently tabled in parliament in December 1993. That audit report was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report No. 20 of 1993-94: Efficiency audit&mdash;Northern Land Council</EMPHASIS>. It referred specifically to various matters relating to the Northern Land Council. Report No. 20, and again I remind the Senate it was tabled in December 1993, made some 52 recommendations relating to various aspects of the financial operations of the Northern Land Council&mdash;52 recommendations of a very serious and complex nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that we have before us today, some 15 or 16 months later, is the subsequent and required follow-up audit that was agreed would be undertaken after 12 months. This report concerns me. I notice on the last page of the report, page 33, there is an appendix which sets out the status of the various recommendations. As I mentioned, there were 52 recommendations. One has obviously dropped off in the counting due to arrangements within a financial year. But I notice from the schedule on page 33 that action has been completed and obviously met with satisfactory recommendations with regard to 24 of the recommendations, further action is still required with regard to 22 of the recommendations and action has not yet commenced on five of the recommendations. So some 27 recommendations of the original 52 are still outstanding and require attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's office makes note of the significant action that has been taken by the Northern Land Council with regard to a number of issues. I suppose that is important. It is important to put that on the record, but I remind the Senate that it is in respect of only 24 of the original 52 recommendations that that credit has been given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still consider that the action of the Northern Land Council has not been dealt with with sufficient urgency. I do not believe the minister has involved himself sufficiently in the areas that are still of concern and about which the Auditor-General's office is still making some quite serious allegations and requests for further attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst these audit reports are often written in the language of appeasement, we need to go very much into the detail of them. Whilst you can read the key findings and the general summary points and it would appear on a first glance that they are satisfactory, that is not so. As I said, five of the recommendations have not been actioned and some 22 of them require further action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look specifically at some of the issues that do require particular and further attention. It is important that we not let slip the necessary pressure that is needed on groups and organisations such as the Northern Land Council. I do not wish to appear to be vindictive in any way, but what we need to remember here is that the funds that flow to the Northern Land Council are moneys in trust. The funds are derived from consolidated revenue, from the raising of royalty equivalents, and they are then earmarked for the administrative action of the land councils. Very often the land councils have to lucky dip into those royalty trust funds in order to top up their administration. This denies Aboriginal people other benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues where follow-up is required relate to the administration of the royalty trust accounts, the advances to council members, the use of fringe benefits tax arrangements for staff, the use and engagement of consultants, the control of expenditure and the section 64 funding and distribution of surpluses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administration of royalty trust accounts is an issue about which I consider the minister has long been totally derelict in the discharge of his requirements under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. It is now some 16 months later and we are still seeing the Auditor-General comment on issues that require detailed further assessment. I would certainly encourage anyone who is looking at this matter to go to the detailed parts of this report and look at the continuing issues where the recommendation is that a review of the royalty payment procedures should be undertaken to ensure that they are complete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter in this section I wish to talk about is the use of fringe benefits arrangements for staff. Some senators may recall that back in 1993 when I raised this issue I was certainly pursuing the special arrangements that had been put in place for the previous director of the Northern Land Council, Mr Mick Dodson, who is now the Social Justice Commissioner for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs for the Labor government. A very special, generous arrangement was put in place and we have never seen the full details of that arrangement. This report highlights that those  arrangements had not yet been properly dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Department of Industrial Relations has indicated that the application to senior staff was in breach of the Public Service Union (Central and Northern Land Councils) Award of 1990 is, to me, still a sore point. Mr Dodson has a lot to answer for because of the ineptitude of the administration of the land council during his period as director, which resulted in all of these 52 major recommendations being made, and also because of his dereliction of duty with regard to the administration of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account, of which he was a primary adviser during the entire period that has caused a lot of reviews in that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned that the special fringe benefits arrangements have not yet been concluded. That is one of the issues the Auditor-General is now calling into question. It in turn must call into question Mr Dodson's capability, capacity and qualification to go on acting as the Social Justice Commissioner until such time as these matters have been properly concluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, the issues relating to control of expenditure worry me, as do those that relate to the funding and distribution of surpluses. With regard to the general management, there are comments with regard to outstanding issues relating to leave fares, debt recovery processes, the use of fuel cards and motor vehicles. These are all significant because of the example organisations such as land councils must give to so many other organisations in the whole area of the Aboriginal portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a parent body or an umbrella organisation such as the Northern Land Council continues to receive the criticism and rebuke of the Auditor-General and if it cannot get its books in order or its accounts properly administered within a period of some 16 months, then we do need to look very carefully at these areas. In fact, it must be a matter about which Mr Tickner, as the responsible minister, must take full responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very concerning report. I am concerned that some 16 months later further issues are arising. Of course, there is no mention of what happens now. There should be a subsequent review. I do not believe that the Auditor-General's office can in any way think this is the final report on the matter. The fact that 27 of 52 recommendations have not been  satisfactorily answered demands that the Auditor-General continue to take a close monitoring role in this particular area&mdash;whether it is a review of the minister's responsibility and the activities of the parent body, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, or whether it is with regard to the express issues that relate to the Northern Land Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly well aware that the Northern Land Council is still engaged in a number of very controversial arrangements in the Northern Territory, particularly with regard to the royalty area. It is engaged in a major Federal Court action at the moment with the Gagudju Association. Because of those particular issues, there is no way the Northern Land Council can continue to be considered in any way a satisfactory organisation until these matters are properly concluded. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The report relating to the refurbishment of Scarborough House in the construction of Commonwealth offices at Phillip, ACT, is the committee's first report for 1995. The objective of this proposal, which is sponsored by Australian Estate Management, is to provide modern office accommodation for the Australian Industrial Property Organisation. Senators may be more familiar with its former title of the Patent Designs and Trademarks Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AEM is proposing an extensive refurbishment and fitout of Scarborough House's 14 office floors, ground floor, basement, roof and facade, and is proposing minor works to the building surrounds. Scarborough House will be upgraded to a standard commensurate with current commercial office building standards. The proposed annex building will consist of a new two-wing, five-level commercial standard office building with central atrium and associated landscaping. The committee has recommended that the project proceed at an estimated outturn cost of $50.38 million at July 1994 prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of AEM, as the sponsoring agency, are to provide accommodation to meet the needs of AIPO; to protect the Commonwealth's investment in Scarborough House by maintaining its income capacity; and to reduce the Commonwealth's overall property costs through a well managed portfolio of owned office buildings. Scarborough House has not had a major upgrade of services, structure or finishes since it was constructed in 1970. The committee was advised by AEM at the public hearing that a condition audit of Scarborough House indicated that it is now well below acceptable, modern, commercial office standards, particularly in the area of occupational health and safety requirements and is considered to be at the end of its current commercial life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to ensure the building retains its value as an asset of the Commonwealth, AEM believes that an extensive refurbishment is now required. AIPO has occupied the entire building since 1971. Various options for the redevelopment of Scarborough House, with a view to satisfying AIPO's accommodation requirements, have been investigated over recent years. AIPO's accommodation requirements had identified the need for a significant increase in space and the need to co-locate in the Woden office centre precinct. AIPO believes that the fragmentation of its office accommodation results in inefficiencies and increased costs, including time wasted in personnel movement, delivery costs and transport costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was advised that a range of options were developed and investigated both to satisfy AIPO's accommodation requirements and to provide the Commonwealth with a satisfactory financial investment. This attitude fits in with our normal process. The committee is satisfied that the proposal which is the subject of this first report for 1995 represents an effective accommodation solution at an affordable cost for AIPO, will provide value for money for the Commonwealth as it extends the useful life of an existing asset and will provide an additional Commonwealth owned office building to meet a long-term need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report which I have tabled recommends redevelopment of housing for service families at the Land Warfare Centre at Canungra, Queensland, at an estimated cost of $7.86 million. Families at Canungra are presently living in timber frame houses clad with asbestos sheeting. These pre-1960 style houses are substandard and contribute to personnel and family problems. At the public hearing, the Tenant Consultative Group advised the committee that the morale of families currently occupying these houses is at its lowest ebb. The committee inspected this accommodation and agreed that a need exists to provide suitable housing for those defence personnel and their families. Again, it is in line with the attitude of upgrading housing for defence personnel generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Housing Authority proposes to remove 47 houses in the Boike Road and Corcoran Crescent precincts. One existing house will be upgraded, and 26 houses built in the Corcoran Crescent precinct. Twenty-nine houses will be constructed in the Boike Road precinct. The houses in Corcoran Crescent will be replaced with larger houses on bigger blocks of land. The larger blocks extend beyond the existing lot boundaries but do not encroach on the surrounding bushland. Two-storey houses will be built on the smaller blocks. This will provide a variety of housing in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the public hearing at Canungra, the Tenant Consultative Group advised the committee that it is satisfied with the consultative process with the Defence Housing Authority, which has always been willing to listen to its views. The houses will be fitted with earth leakage circuit breakers and smoke detectors. The Defence Housing Authority has advised the committee that it has a retrofit program for the installation of earth leakage circuit breakers and smoke detectors in all of its houses already constructed. The committee commends the Defence Housing Authority on this decision. The committee believes that the proposal will provide defence personnel and their families with good quality housing consistent with community standards. I commend the reports to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>This morning I informally talked to the opposition, the Australian Democrats and the Greens in a meeting convened about our approach to the draft Senate legislative program for this, the last week of the sittings. At that meeting, I outlined the sorts of constraints that we face in this last week. A number of suggestions have been canvassed, including the possibility of forgoing general business this week and of maximising utilisation of lunch hours so that that time can be used, if not for non-controversial legislation, then for second reading speeches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We looked at the possibility of the Senate sitting a little earlier tomorrow&mdash;between the hours of 12.30 p.m. and 2.00 p.m.&mdash;to deal with second reading speeches. That is a matter that we might advise on at a later stage. Those sitting hours would mirror those of the House of Representatives. Question time would be at 2.00 p.m. with prayers at 12.30. I await advice from the opposition on its approach to that. The Senate might deal with that matter at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the maximum opportunity for ensuring that we have our best shot at the much truncated and revised legislative program lies in our being as flexible as we can with our sitting hours. It is for that reason that I propose we agree to the motion standing in Senator Crowley's name that we meet through to the hour of 10.30 p.m. tonight and also on Tuesday and Thursday night of this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am hopeful that, with the cooperation of all senators and with the continued good management of the Senate, this revised legislative program will be dealt with in its entirety in the course of this sitting week. I point out to the Senate that a very substantial number of bills have been removed from the legislative program. It had been the government's intention to deal with them. I ask for the support of all senators in this very sensible approach to good management and to dealing with the pressure of work before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a question of good management. In this session of parliament, there has been no management at all. That, in fact, is the problem. As a result of that lack of management, we come to the last week of the sittings and see that the government finds&mdash;as is so often the case&mdash;that its bills have stacked up, and it does not have time to complete its program. So it comes to other senators and asks whether they will agree to extending the program and the sitting times of the Senate on three of the sitting days this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are prepared to be more than reasonable in other respects. I think that anyone who looks at the time taken by the opposition during this period of the parliament will see that, in matters of public importance and the like, we have probably introduced fewer debates than I can remember. That should have very much facilitated the government's timetable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are still prepared to be cooperative. We are prepared to concede our Thursday afternoon general business this week, which the government can now take up with its legislative program, but we are not prepared to agree to the extension for the three nights that have been suggested&mdash;tonight, Tuesday and Thursday&mdash;because someone has to make an attempt to keep this government honest. Once upon a time the Australian Democrats used to boast that that was their function. But they abandoned that some time after the departure of Senator Chipp. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have. Since then, the Australian Democrats have slotted very firmly into the Labor Party camp. Basically, if the government asks them for an extension of sittings for three days of this week, they will simply give it the nod. They are very closely aligned to the Australian Labor Party these days. I keep warning them about it. It is why they are slipping so badly in the polls. People can now not see a distinction between the Australian Democrats and the ALP; that is how firmly they have become enmeshed. It is not in their best interests, but they seem to not want to take that advice from me, generously given though it is.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has to do with the fact that in this chamber only the coalition is prepared to try to keep the government to a program. The government has a responsibility to bring to this place its legislative program in an orderly form so that the Senate might have a reasonable time to debate each and every one of its bills. We are happy to do that; it is our responsibility. But, on the other hand, the government is not prepared to manage its program in that way. So, again, we have seen a stacking of bills during the last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that we did not agree to these new sitting times of the Senate. This decision was again imposed on us by others in this chamber&mdash;the government, the Australian Democrats and at least one other group&mdash;in opposition to us. We were told that, under these sitting hours, the government, with reasonable management, would be able to meet its program without having to extend the sittings. Now that it has come to the test for the second time, it has again failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government knows that at the end of the session it can simply demand extra sitting time and get it, unless parties within the Senate are prepared to stand up to the government and say, `You have been elected to govern. It is now your responsibility to manage the program of this place efficiently and properly.' That is why I will not agree to the government's proposal today. It has failed in its planning. It is now coming to us, on the basis of that failure, and saying, `Notwithstanding our errors, facilitate our program.' Once we agree to that, it knows that on each and every occasion it can demand the same thing. It is about time it put some effort into programming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said the other day when this matter was raised, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) has had other priorities in this session. He has had a lot of trouble with the environment portfolio. But if he was unable to manage the government business, he should have passed that responsibility over to somebody else. We would then not be in the mess that we are in at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are sick and tired of the fact that constantly this Senate, under the leadership of the Australian Labor Party and, unfortunately, the votes of particularly the Australian Democrats, has been reducing the options and capability of the opposition and minority parties to play a full part. For example, time allocated for dealing with matters of public importance has been halved. The adjournment debate has been reduced. Speaking times for individual senators have been reduced. We thought that the Australian Democrats would have fought for the opportunity to contribute to these issues in this chamber and do what they were elected to do. The Australian Democrats have gone to water at the request of the government. Senators have had their opportunities curtailed. That has been at a loss to the democratic process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Senate is the one real chamber of debate within the federal parliamentary system in Australia. With each step that is taken by the government, in cohort with the Australian Democrats, to reduce that capacity, it is at a loss that will not be recovered. We never find the government bringing before this chamber proposals to extend the opportunity for contributions by individual senators. Every proposal that is brought here is designed to reduce that capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says it needs more time to get through its legislative program. Even with that extra time, at the end of the session it finds that it cannot meet its commitments. So it comes to the Senate and says, `We now need extra time. You should agree.' The Australian Democrats nod. They say, `We will agree to whatever the ALP wants.' But we will not be treated in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a modest way, we know that we will lose. We will not again have the numbers. But we will at least attempt to keep this government honest for the short time that it will remain in office. Presuming that there will not be an election until next year, the minister will have two extra chances to put a bit of effort into the program and get it right. Perhaps we will not be engaging in a debate like this one. But the chances of that, based on the Labor Party's record, will be next to nil. The government should get the program within the hours that it set for the Senate and for which it got the agreement of the minor parties. It should not seek to impose these extra times at the end of the session. We will vote against this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I must thank Senator Hill for such a low level of abuse in that speech. He did not even raise his voice. I am amazed. He usually gets to screaming at about this point. I was interested to see how long it would take Senator Hill to get to his favourite theme in procedural matters, which is how evil the Australian Democrats are. He always gets to it pretty close to the beginning of his speech. It was within two minutes this time. It may be a new record. He then spent the next five or six minutes elaborating on his theme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of Senator Hill's favourite points in these themes is how the business of the Senate is extended beyond the sitting hours that are set down in the standing orders. According to him, the government does grubby little deals with the Democrats. If we look at a few really interesting statistics, perhaps he will change his mind about that. In 1994, we extended for 14 nights. There were two divisions where the opposition was upset about this. In 1993, we extended for 17 nights, and there were three divisions where the opposition was upset about this. In 1992, we extended for 24 nights, and there were seven divisions&mdash;a much higher number of divisions&mdash;where the opposition was upset about this. This leaves an awful lot of extensions where the opposition was not upset about this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Faulkner says, `Please don't.' I will not. I will only do it once. The question is: what are the numbers in here when these extensions are agreed to? In the vast majority of cases, the answer is that the opposition votes with the government. What the Democrats think is irrelevant. The numbers show that the opposition agrees with the government that the time should be extended. That is what happens on most occasions. So the argument that the Democrats do this all the time is not true. The opposition is the fourth faction of the Labor Party. One can see that in divisions, because the opposition tends to vote with the Labor Party more than the Democrats vote with the Labor Party. Never mind. It is very sad, but that is the way that things go in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion, the Democrats believe that there are good reasons for most of the legislation that the government wants to finish this sittings. I am looking forward tomorrow to going through that legislation in the meeting that the Manager of Government Business has set up with the opposition, the Democrats and the independents to see what time we can expect to have available to go through those bills and how long he expects each bill to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also believe that there is a glitch in the system which prevents us having an orderly program. The opposition, the Democrats, the independents or the Greens can send a bill off to a Friday committee for consideration and then that bill does not turn up on the notice paper when the government expected it to. That is not the fault of the government, it is because somebody has decided that a particular bill needs more scrutiny&mdash;and that is fair enough. That produces a glitch in the system and means that bills pile up towards the end of the sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something we have to look at when we examine the way the new system works. Many opposition senators were in complete and utter agreement with the proposal to establish this new system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens will be supporting this motion at this time, but only on the understanding that the Greens will not be supporting any further extension of time beyond the 10.30 p.m. extension on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. We have said that if the Senate needs, say, 10 minutes to complete a bill then we would consider that on its merits.

That is the first reason for not extending the times any further, regardless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second reason is that we believe that the discussions between the opposition, the Democrats, the Greens, Senator Harradine, Senator Devereux and Senator Faulkner regarding the streamlining and cutting down of the list of bills we are expected to complete in the extended hours to a more realistic level should continue. We understand that those discussions will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason for us reluctantly supporting this motion is that we believe that the government should thoroughly review its method of processing its legislation to reduce the quantity of legislation that is being brought into this place and prioritise it better.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to see that I am out of order. I think the Senate as a whole must be very concerned about the list of bills that confronts us. In my view, a number of pieces of legislation should not be regarded as so very urgent as to be incorporated into the list for discussion this week. One of those is the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators would know, that piece of legislation attempts to overturn the principles contained in a decision of the Federal Court which granted refugee status to a married couple. The woman was eight months pregnant when she arrived in Australia; she later gave birth to the child. They had a well-established fear of persecution if they were returned to China&mdash;the persecution being compulsory sterilisation. The couple established that to everyone's satisfaction; there was no question about the fact that they would be forcibly sterilised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the refugee convention, you have to establish not only that you have a fear which is well founded&mdash;bringing in the objective as well as the subjective nature of that fear&mdash;but also that it would be because of a convention reason: namely, because of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group. You can be absolutely certain that you are going to face persecution if you return to your persecutors but, unless you can jump that second hurdle, you are not eligible for refugee status. The judge held that the first four reasons were not relevant. Therefore, he decided that the couple were members of a particular social group&mdash;namely, parents with one child who were identified and targeted by China's fertility control policy, which they resisted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill which the government wants to pass would mean that those persons would not be able to jump that hurdle. In other words, this bill in effect says to the courts and the independent refugee tribunal that, no matter what suffering and persecution people will face if they are returned to the PRC, they will not be able to jump that second hurdle because, in determining whether or not the refugee is a member of a particular social group, the fertility control policies of the PRC must be disregarded. In effect, the legislation will deny refugee status to an asylum seeker who has a well-founded fear of sterilisation or coerced abortion under China's fertility control policy if returned to China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has appealed that decision to the full bench of the Federal Court. What I want to know&mdash;and this is relevant to this debate&mdash;is why the government wants to have that debate here. The only reason why the government wants to have the debate here&mdash;and I have this on very good authority&mdash;is that the government's legal advisers think it will lose the appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask those senators with legal training who are in the chamber to consider what they are being asked to do. They are being asked to do the government's dirty work. The government will not, according to its legal advisers, be successful in its appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court. If I can develop support for my position, I will not be a party to giving the government by legislation what the courts will not give it in this very important matter which impinges upon the human rights of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we did that, it would mean that Australia would be party to cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment of defenceless human beings, and I believe that would disqualify Australia from being a civilised country. I think people should understand very well what is happening on this matter. I urge honourable senators to have regard to, examine and not rely on the government's suggestion that it will establish a particular social group on a pre-existing social group. All of the legal advice that has come to me says that that will not enable persons in the situation before the court to jump the second hurdle. The government says that the minister has a non-compellable discretion. In my view, that would derogate from our obligations under an international convention&mdash;namely, the refugee convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask honourable senators to think about those matters, as they are very important. I ask the government to consider whether or not it now believes that this is a bill which is so urgent as to be part of this list of bills that we must get through this week. Because this legislation is opposed by people such as the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Amnesty International, the Law Council of Australia, various women's groups, refugee support groups, the Australian Catholic bishops and a whole range of religious organisations, I believe that it is incumbent upon this chamber to scrutinise this legislation minutely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government thinks it is going to get that legislation through in five minutes, it has another think coming. The minister had better be very prepared before he comes into this chamber because I can see that the committee stage of that bill will be lengthy indeed. One of the principle functions of the Senate chamber is to protect the rights of minorities and to protect human rights and due process. </PARA>

One of the problems with what I believe was a very useful reform of the routine of business of this chamber is that the period that is dedicated for government business is not in fact dedicated for government business.

Your carping criticisms ought to be looked at from the perspective that it is very rare for the opposition to come forward with a positive idea about how to reform the Senate's legislative program, how to reform the routine of business, how we can perhaps better operate, how our procedures can be revamped.

Senator Cook said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are really five reasons why we think performance audits in GBEs, understandably and reasonably, should not be conducted by the Auditor-General. All of them have a quite practical, real world aspect to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that they do represent a peculiar add-on cost to a government business enterprise that is operating in the private sector under the disciplines of private sector regulation and private sector competition. As a consequence, we add a handicap to the saddlebags of the GBE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is the question of how we measure the performance of a government business enterprise in this sense. The best an audit of this sort can do is provide a snapshot of what is the case at that time. Measurement of the performance of a GBE is something else again. I do not think those audits can provide a basis for measurement of performance. Trading outcomes, return on capital and the amount of return to the Commonwealth are other matters&mdash;as well as market share and so on&mdash;that a GBE might have. I do not know whether the audit office is in a position to provide anything useful on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it gives a free kick to the competitors of the GBE in the sense that they do not have to go through that process&mdash;but the GBE does. I think that is a wrong weighting. The fourth point I make is that parliament has the means at its disposal, anyway, to ensure that the GBEs handle themselves properly. It does that, where it sees fit, by instituting an inquiry. I cite, for example, ANL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the view of the minister for shipping, Laurie Brereton, that the Auditor-General should be called in to do an audit of ANL. Without going to the issues of the ANL, the Senate in its wisdom chose to conduct an inquiry and forwent the opportunity of the executive wing of government's invitation to the Auditor-General. In that sense, the Senate chose to override and inquire. I do not judge it in terms of what was appropriate; all I say is that it is an example of the parliament conducting a complete review of a particular entity for reasons that parliament saw as being of proper and appropriate concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It demonstrates that parliament does do these things and does have them under its purview. There is also the national performance monitoring committee, which is a body set up between the federal and state governments and which monitors all GBEs in the public sectors in the Commonwealth and in the state and territory jurisdictions. A monitoring performance on those GBEs is shared constitutionally now. To add an extra burden to that is inappropriate in my submission. I said there were five reasons; I have given you four. I have rolled the cost question into the add-on question of the extra time and effort a GBE might have to engage in to conduct such an audit.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope those reasons why the government does not support this amendment assist you, Senator Short. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the minister that the offer in relation to the Australian National Line was very limited. It was the offer of a full performance audit only to be available at the point at which Australian National Line was sold. It was worth nothing whatsoever in terms of accountability and scrutiny of the public or the parliament. That is why the Greens, amongst other people, chose to support an inquiry rather than the very limited offer. That is exactly why it is necessary for the parliament to have the ability to at least call for the Auditor-General to make full audits of these without having to wait for the permission of the minister or sometimes for the political reasons why permission has not been received from the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This amendment to clause 15 is the same amendment as Democrats amendment No. 3. This amendment is similar to the previous amendment relating to Commonwealth authorities that we have just agreed to. However, this clause applies to Commonwealth companies which are GBEs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between this amendment and the previous one is that this amendment contains a provision to restrict the Auditor-General's mandate by decision of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit to exempt such government business enterprises which have `significant private sector financial ownership'. We consider it appropriate and proper that where GBEs are also partially privately owned, are under independent management and are accountable to all shareholders&mdash;not just to the Commonwealth&mdash;there ought to be scope for exemption.

This is absolutely vital and consistent with best practice in the states and the Commonwealth. The only difference between our amendment and the original amendment of the opposition was that we replaced the word `involvement' with the word `ownership'. This was to ensure that GBEs with high debts were not able to be precluded from efficiency auditing. In our view, unless the GBE is subject to shareholder scrutiny through the Stock Exchange, it should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny through the Auditor-General.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand why an opposition which is a coalition of conservative parties who distrust and do not support the idea of public enterprise would wish to install this sort of amendment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment makes it very difficult for public enterprise to compete fairly with private enterprise. We hear in this chamber from time to time arguments that, in fact, private enterprise is disadvantaged in competing with public enterprise for a host of reasons. The government supports the concept of competitive neutrality; that is to say, we should level the playing field between private and public sector so that they can compete fairly with one another and, therefore, see in particular provinces of industry who is the most effective at delivering a service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am one who fervently believes that there is a place&mdash;and a very important key place&mdash;in an economy like Australia's for public enterprise. But we ought not saddle public enterprises with provisions that do not apply to the private sector and which put them at a competitive disadvantage&mdash;that is to say, neutrality does not apply; we put there not a plus sign or an equals sign but a minus sign and ensure disadvantage to the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that for these reasons. Firstly, we are talking about public companies. No company belonging to the private sector conducts and publishes an audit of this sort enabling all the other firms competing with it to see what its internal workings are. Companies belonging to the private sector do not do that because they would regard most of the information contained in such a document as commercial-in-confidence&mdash;that is, in confidence to themselves. But here we are proposing to do that; that is, by a performance audit, to broadcast to all the competitors of public enterprise what the internal performance is&mdash;something that they do not do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is a cost factor here. We are imposing on public enterprise a cost which does not and will not apply to private enterprise. We are asking them to shoulder a higher burden than they would otherwise have and, thus, put another hurdle or handicap in front of them. We believe that these ought to be seen for what they are: performance audits are an add-on that we impose in the public sector. But to take it all the way through to publicly owned companies competing with privately owned companies is a different kettle of fish to applying it to departments of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the parliament were to continue to put hurdles in the way of public enterprise, who would that advantage? It would not advantage the public. It would not necessarily mean that there is going to be a truly competitive framework here. It advantages, unfairly, the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not necessarily popular to argue in favour of public enterprise. If we look at the burden of argument in the media and, indeed, the scope of argument mounted in this place, frequently it is all about breaking down public monopoly or breaking down the ability of the public sector to compete. But what this amendment does is try to extend a principle appropriate, in the government's view, to departments and agencies of the government but not appropriate where the field of competition is open and joined by the private sector versus the public sector. The first point I would make is that this is a tilting of the playing field against the interests of fair competition on a competitive neutrality basis; and it is a tilting of the playing field against the public sector overall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point would be the unpredictable cost overlay to a GBE in assisting the office in responding to all of the demands. An audit of the books, which of course we support, is one thing&mdash;the accounts are laid out in a way in which that would be streamlined for the auditor, from a public sector point of view&mdash;but an audit of performance requires the collection of data from a wide cross-section of subsections within that enterprise, and that constitutes a real cost. So I think that also has to be seen in that cost factor context. Publishing the information or making the information public gives a free kick to the private sector competitors, and I think that is unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look again at Senator Short's amendment to clause 15, page 5, lines one to five. It is worth while just looking at the terms of this amendment to underline the contention I have put. The last couple of lines do reveal the problem. The amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor-General may at any time conduct a performance audit of a Commonwealth company that is a GBE (other than a GBE accepted by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit as a GBE with significant private sector financial ownership)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>so `significant private sector financial ownership' is excluded, but what is included is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or any of its subsidiaries.</PARA>
<PARA>So that is a GBE not only itself but any subsidiaries it helps form. Often in those subsidiaries there may be a private sector participation which would also have to be audited on a performance audit basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles I think this committee should balance in this discussion are the principles about whether or not the activities of these organisations are open and transparent and our financial and administrative control of those organisations sufficient. But, where competition applies, we have to approach an analysis of balancing that type of objective against the real world of competition. In doing so, I think we have to have regard to not hobbling public sector companies with unnecessary obligations, such as the sharing of shareholders information on a public level which would put them at a competitive disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons I ask the committee whether it would not mind revisiting the fundamental reasons as to why support has been indicated for this amendment. I think, in balancing here the principles of open transparency and competition, we may be&mdash;in fact, we will be&mdash;doing a massive disservice to public service enterprise. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the minister's arguments against this amendment, I draw his attention to report No. 331, which is the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the bills as originally proposed. Without reading it all, I want to draw particular attention to paragraphs 4.33 through to 4.39 and the subsequent recommendations. Laid out in that report very clearly are quotes from a range of experts&mdash;such as the Auditor-General, Professor Finn, from the Australian National University, and some of the major accounting bodies&mdash;supporting the reasons that lie behind the jointly sponsored amendment by the coalition and the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I do not want to read them all out. I will take one which is put forward by the accounting bodies. They argue that, while GBEs may be accountable to their minister under this proposal, they are not accountable to their shareholders, which are the public. They state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Entities that use or manage public resources must be held accountable to the public. Unlike shareholders of a company in the private sector, the ultimate owner of a GBE, being the public, cannot withdraw their funds at any time if dissatisfied with management's performance. Therefore an alternative mechanism to protect the public interest is required. One such mechanism is an audit by the Auditor-General . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The remaining couple of pages support that proposition. The only other point I make in response to the minister's comments is that a significant difference between a GBE and a purely private sector company is that GBEs have an implicit guarantee via the government if they are essentially in government ownership. The guarantor in that case is the Australian taxpayer and that adds further weight to the reasons why we believe this proposed amendment is appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I need to say a couple of things to finalise the debate. I draw the chamber's attention, given that Senator Short was the last speaker, to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of 2 March 1995. This is not my favourite newspaper and it is not one I am given to comment from at any length. But I have not conveniently selected it for any reason other than it carries a report on a major overhaul of the Auditor-General's office in Victoria and the position of the Victorian state government in dealing with that report. This article points to a matter that I know is the case. A recommendation of this sort came before the Kennett government. Despite that government's quite strong private sector and conservative credentials, that government rejected this part of the report. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the argument I can anticipate from Senator Short about this, but what is good for Jeff Kennett may not be good for a future coalition government&mdash;although it ought to give pause to the coalition that the most stridently pro-conservative figure in Australia at the present time finds that this is not a satisfactory amendment and does, to some extent, defend the position of public enterprise. The article, under the heading `State rejects auditor plans', states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further recommendation to enshrine the Auditor-General's access to documents from departments including Premier and Cabinet, Treasury&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I can understand all of that from a conservative figure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and State Owned Enterprises&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is what we are debating here&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was also rejected.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed changes were recommended in a report by the Coalition dominated Parliamentary Public Accounts and Estimates Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>And so on it goes. For the record, it is interesting to note that even Jeff Kennett finds this an intrusion on public enterprise, one presumes from his rejection of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with a couple of other things that have been said. Senator Margetts has picked up my remarks about the unpopularity in political debate in Australia of defending the role of public enterprises. I was simply making those remarks to say that, unpopular as it might be at certain times, nonetheless this government defends that role. We do not see public enterprise as necessarily something just to sell off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key issue for us is that they operate efficiently and, therefore, a degree of commercialisation may be necessary or, in some cases, it may be necessary to create a competitive environment. But monopolies are not what you will get cost efficiencies and savings for consumers out of as a general principle and therefore we have moved as we have. But the idea of public enterprise, I can assure the chamber, is alive and well in the Labor Party. If you agree with that, then why put extra hurdles in its way and derogate from the principle of competitive neutrality? The issue for this chamber for both the Democrats and the Greens is that these amendments will do that and so how does that serve the wider purpose and the wider good? I cannot see that it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the argument is that it does because it leads to greater accountability, what would be more greatly accountable that this chamber does not already have access to? It has access to the audited accounts of these organisations. It has access to the annual reports of these organisations. It has powers to call and inquire as to what happens in these organisations. From time to time it sets up inquiries into particular GBEs. The inquiry into the ANL Ltd is a case in point. The minister, Laurie Brereton, proposed inviting the Auditor-General to undertake an investigation of the ANL. That seemed to be an appropriate act for a minister to take, but the Senate declined that approach. The Senate preferred to conduct its own review of the company's activities. That is a preference of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I make is not the politics of whether the Brereton inquiry should have gone ahead or the Senate inquiry should have taken place. That is an argument we have already had. The point is that this is scrutiny. This is scrutiny which comes to this chamber. What beyond that do you need to do to ensure accountability, bearing in mind that this is not a clear case of black and white accountability or nothing? This is a case of that type of access and accountability versus the overriding principle of putting hurdles or obstructions in the way of public enterprise. On that basis I earnestly request that you reconsider the position that seems to be evolving here. </PARA>

I guess I would have to agree in general cases, but we just signed on to the Uruguay Round of GATT, which makes it very difficult for Australia or any other country to fight against monopoly takeovers of our own industries. I wonder how that fits into the government's current position in relation to monopolies. We can have entire industries like our banana industry in Queensland taken over by a monopoly buyer from another country. If that is not efficient, that is what the government is doing as part of its policy on trade.

One can understand why that might be something for the government. In a competitive situation in the private sector one has to look at that as certainly an imperative, but whether parliament would want to try and then use an audit for the purposes of trying to direct a particular policy application on that subject, or in the use of credit cards or in some other thing like that, which gives a competitive disadvantage to that company, is another thing entirely.

It comes down to the Auditor-General dealing with the principle of those who consume public money being audited. I will defend myself from the mild calumny ventured against me opposite. When I spoke earlier, I was talking about public companies. The money which they consume and use is not taxpayer money. It is money garnered from their commercial activities. The principle here is that those who use and expend money should be properly audited. This proposed amendment to clause 27(2) confuses the issue unnecessarily so.

As I see it, clause 27 says that the operation of proposed sections 29 and 30 is not limited by any other law except to the extent that the other law expressly excludes the operation of proposed sections 29 and 30.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer starts by going back to the role of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General audits matters relating to expenditure.

<PARA>This amendment relates to essentially the same issue as the last amendment. It seeks to remove the reference to clause 22 in clause 28 which limits the information gathering powers of the Auditor-General. Clause 22 deals with the extra reports by the Auditor-General to the parliament. As it stands, the legislation would deny the Auditor-General the ability to use his extensive information gathering powers in preparing such reports for the parliament. It is certainly unacceptable to the coalition that he would be denied that ability other than taking into account the protection of parliamentary immunity issue that we have just debated. One interpretation of clause 28 could be that it limits the Auditor-General's ability to properly respond to, for example, an order of the Senate. That would be unfortunate to say the least. </PARA>

We do this for a number of very important and quite fundamental reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 34 deals with sensitive information not being included in public reports. Set out under 34(2) are reasons (a) to (f) as to the nature of those considerations. To illustrate the reasons, their importance and the weight that they should bare in the deliberations of this chamber, let me quote clause 34(2)(a). It says that nothing should be revealed `if it would prejudice the security, defence or international relations of the Commonwealth'. I will just pause at that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the suspension for dinner, I heard Senator Spindler argue that the states do not have a section in their audit acts which corresponds with this section. To the best of my knowledge, that is true, but the reason why the states do not is obvious: that is, the states do not have an international relations, defence or security function. The Commonwealth, under the constitution, performs these functions. Therefore, in the role of the auditor in the states, the issue of informational sensitivity does not arise. As a consequence, one can easily understand why state legislation does not address itself to the problem of sensitive information becoming available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that needs to be made is that this clause of the bill finds an existing home already in the act. We are not seeking by this amending bill to change the provisions under which we currently operate. It is interesting that no-one has adduced a reason in this debate as to why clause 34 should be altered. Although it has been in existence in one form or another for a very long time&mdash;in fact, since the founding of the Federation&mdash;no argument has been adduced in any way to say that it is defective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that the threshold point would be to say that there are reasons why what has been a longstanding fundamental principle of Auditor-General law has changed. That has not happened. In the absence of an explanation, one must conclude&mdash;as I think on the evidence one would conclude&mdash;that, with respect, there is no reason other than what lurks in the back of senators' minds as to what might occur. But we have to deal with what does occur. One can invent all sorts of conspiracies and scenarios, but none of those would appear, on the empirical evidence, to be appropriate in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I would make is that, given that there is a foreshadowed amendment, if this bill were to transfer into law, perhaps the Joint Committee of Public Accounts should be the committee that is consulted. The difficulty with that is that this is a public accounts committee of the parliament. How could we expect such a committee to understand the sensitivities of `security, defence or international relations of the Commonwealth'? Its function is to understand the audit process and, while there may be members of the committee who have a broader knowledge than that&mdash;and I do not deny that&mdash;the purpose of the committee is not to understand those quite sensitive issues. The government believes that to expect the committee to understand these matters would clothe it with a power to make assessments, aggrandise it well beyond its scope and ask it to perform a function that it is not equipped to perform. If that amendment comes forward, we would reject it as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leaves me with the issue of the Auditor-General and the Attorney-General. The argument being put here is that the Attorney-General is, after all, another politician and that the Attorney-General having a say on these matters is inappropriate. The Auditor-General should have an unfettered reign and be able to roam across the landscape without the Attorney-General saying to him or her at any particular point, `Please, in the interests of national security, don't go beyond this point.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General cannot be depicted as simply another politician. The Attorney-General has sworn an oath of office as the first law officer of the Commonwealth of Australia and, as a consequence, has weighty responsibilities imposed on him or her and part of those responsibilities go to the issue of national security. The Attorney-General is appropriately aware of national security concerns. It may well be that so too is the Auditor-General, but it can never be contended that the Auditor-General would know more about the subject of national security and indeed know of the sensitivities of particular material better than the Attorney-General would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General will always have the job of knowing that information and maintaining a bird's-eye view across the whole front of government activities and therefore know how particular information taken in isolation from the main body of information or intelligence relates to that whole body. Here there could be a mistake of lack of knowledge not of motive. Motivated by the best will in the world, the Auditor-General may wish to have an excursion into a particular area which, in isolation, appears benign enough but with an intelligence overview threatens the national security of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Auditor-General could not be expected to know that; the Attorney-General could be expected to know that, and that is why the Attorney-General should be the person here who issues the instruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue firstly and principally to those opposite, who offer to be an alternative government here in Australia, that they like us, the government, have to have a primary concern when approaching this clause about issues of national security, defence or international relations of the Commonwealth. They have to have a primary concern, too, about all other paragraphs in subclause (2), right the way down and including paragraph (f) for which they have foreshadowed an amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A government in office exercising the weighty powers and responsibilities of government must deport itself in a way in which it has regard to all of those factors. The same&mdash;and I do not say this disparagingly&mdash;is not true of either the Greens or the Democrats, neither of whom have members in the House of Representatives and at this point, foreseeably, might I say, do not appear likely to form a government in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think Senator Margetts has spoken so I do not want to necessarily prejudice what she might say, but I can certainly understand why Senator Spindler might take a slightly different view, removed from the obligations of forming and managing a government. I cannot, for the sake of this clause, understand why a coalition would. Those opposite certainly must have a different view of the weighty responsibilities of government, maybe that goes to the fact that they have been out of it a long time and forgotten or never learnt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, here I urge pause and consideration about what is being done because those reasons are significant. Sensitive information is defined as including information which would prejudice the security, defence or international relations of the Commonwealth; would involve the disclosure of deliberations or decision of the cabinet or a committee of the cabinet; would prejudice relations between the Commonwealth and the state; would divulge any information or matter that was communicated in confidence by the Commonwealth to a state or by a state to the Commonwealth; would unfairly prejudice the commercial interest of any body or person; for any other reason that could form the basis of a claim by the Crown in a judicial proceeding that the information should not be disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those are substantial reasons that attach to the authority of government and the efficacy of government. For those reasons, we oppose the amendments in whatever form is finally concluded between Senator Spindler and Senator Short and, ergo, to the amendment that the coalition has foreshadowed to clause 34(2)(f). </PARA>

However, to deal with that problem by legislation would create a difficulty because it would require the unravelling of the whole application of the Public Service Act to the audit office, including provisions relating to appeal rights, appointment procedures and employment conditions. To do that through legislation would require a massive reproduction of the relevant provisions and extensive consultation with employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are aware that there has been some industrial disputation in the ANAO in recent years. The passing of this amendment, with the best of intentions, would probably severely exacerbate that situation. However, we would urge the government to recognise the recruitment problem that the ANAO has at its top levels and delegate appropriate flexibility to enable it to attract and retain experienced staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that there is no restraint in the current public service legislation precluding the establishment of a separate pay category of auditor to allow for competitive salaries. Such a case already exists for medical and dental officers and lawyers. In most states, separate pay grades for auditors are already in place. That is one reason the states do not seem to suffer the same market detraction problem as the ANAO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would seek a commitment from the government that the attraction and retention problems in the ANAO be fully investigated and that moves be made to establish an appropriate market-related pay rate for auditors. If it proves that such a scale is not possible under the public service legislation, I foreshadow that we will seek to amend the public service legislation to achieve such a category when the public service reform legislation comes before the Senate next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government too opposes this amendment. Reading this amendment to clause 37 under the heading `staff', one is struck by the similarities to clause 24 of this bill headed `contracting outsiders to assist with audits', which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor-General, on behalf of the Commonwealth, may engage any person under contract to assist in the performance of any Auditor-General function.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to prolong this debate. I cannot see any difference being proposed here to what the provision of clause 27 is, given that the change that now occurs in the coalition amendment, as opposed to an earlier foreshadowed amendment, is that the Auditor-General will be bound by this amendment, if carried, to observe the terms and conditions of the industrial relations policy of the government. Of course he should. But that means that it directly corresponds, as I read it, to an existing clause already passed by the chamber and, therefore, is redundant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to what Senator Spindler has said, the Auditor-General's salary, as I recall, is subject to determination by the Remuneration Tribunal and, therefore, by adoption by the government. That is the office of the Auditor-General himself. So are judges of the High Court, of the Federal Court and of all the other courts of the Commonwealth, and so are decisions of parliamentary remuneration. Parliamentarians have an abysmal record of rejecting decisions of the Remuneration Tribunal, but be that on our own heads. We have a religious conviction about adopting the recommendations for all other officers. If someone such as the Auditor-General is unhappy about that and we are to move to some other form of remuneration determination, what are the guidelines here? And why is the Auditor-General any different from independent officers such as judges?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to have a procedure. The procedure is tried and true and workable and effective. It does not stop any of us whose salaries are determined by an arbitral authority disagreeing with the judgments made by that arbitral authority, but the right of the umpire to act here has to be upheld. That is what we do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is an obligation on the committee not to carry this amendment because it corresponds with an existing provision we have already adopted and adds nothing to the bill. If it adds something to the bill, which is not obvious to me as I stand here, then it puts the Auditor-General outside of the strictures that apply in staff hiring and firing. None of that foregoing is meant to be construed in any way that one is not concerned about retention rates. But the retention rates of staff of the Auditor-General, of the senior officers of the Treasury, of senior scientific officers of the Commonwealth and so on are all a matter for the Commonwealth's concern. What is important about the Auditor-General is his function. The skills that he requires to perform that function are readily available in the market. Those skills are not unique; the function is. To our mind it is appropriate that this amendment not be carried. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To assist in the debate I put on the record that the Greens will be opposing this amendment. It has certain attractions. We realise that the conditions under which the Auditor-General operates are different from a number of other departments in that because of the range of areas which the Auditor-General is working in it is necessary from time to time to bring in people with particular expertise because it is simply not possible to carry all of those people with those skills at all times in the department. However, perhaps because the wording of this amendment is so broad it leaves a very wide interpretation, and whilst we might understand that it means that the Auditor-General may see fit to offer a higher rate of terms and conditions to attract certain salaries it might also, with a change of government, without any change in the award system be operated on a lower rate. That is perhaps the problem with this in general. The problem is that it is too broad in the way it is written and therefore we cannot agree to it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not support this amendment and we made that clear at the inquiry. We set out good, solid reasons at the inquiry for why it is an improper procedure&mdash;one that conflicts with the constitutional requirements of the executive and that can render the appointment of an Auditor-General totally unworkable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act provides that the Auditor-General, in the event of a vacancy, should be appointed as soon as possible. One can imagine a procedure where a Leader of the Opposition might capriciously withhold agreement in order to make a political point. Thus, the ability of the parliament to proceed with the appointment of the Auditor-General is delayed and, in fact, thwarted. That is not in the interests of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitutional requirement is for an Auditor-General to be appointed as soon as practical. The constitutional obligation is for the government to do that. This bill provides that whoever is the government of the day will consult with the opposition parties, in order to at least make them aware of it, but not surrender the constitutional rights of the executive. I think this amendment would drag the whole thing into a politicisation process that is unwelcome and unwanted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I further think this arises from a misconception that the Auditor-General is the property of the parliament. The Auditor-General is not the property of the executive either. He is independent. The procedures for the appointment of independent-type statutory positions is clear. It is the same procedure that applies to the High Court and to the other courts of the Commonwealth. It seems to me that this sort of procedure is at odds with all of that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We believe strongly that the parliament has primacy in this matter and that the appointment of the Auditor-General is for parliament to decide and not for the executive alone. We are, if you like, following the UK model.

We make it clear that the regulations cannot take effect until the disallowance period of the parliament has passed. Clause 10 of this bill allows the former regulations to stay in place until the new regulations are passed. This amendment places a six month sunset on this clause requiring the government to bring in a new regulation to the Senate before the end of the year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes the amendment moved jointly by the opposition and the Australian Democrats. It still means that they have the numbers in the committee. The reason the government opposes this amendment, which seeks to expand the size and operation of the present Joint Committee of Public Accounts, is that not only will there be too big a workload but also if it becomes a committee dealing with the operation of the Auditor-General we believe in the end the Auditor-General will be at risk of becoming a creature of the parliamentary committee system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been a principle of the Westminster system going back more than 100 years that the Auditor-General be separate from the executive&mdash;and everyone agrees with that&mdash;and also away from the interference of members of parliament. The Auditor-General reports to parliament on what he or she finds and the parliament debates that. The Auditor-General can only be removed in our constitution and our legislation by a resolution of both houses of parliament. This guarantees the independence of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this amendment was adopted we believe that the Auditor-General would become affected by the operation of the committee, the committee would see that the Auditor-General was reporting to it and not the parliament in its entirety and the Auditor-General would come before the committee on many occasions. It is natural that he would be expected to come before the committee and be subject to cross-examination and required to seek advice. Therefore, the separation between the operation of the Auditor-General and his staff and parliament would start to diminish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think that that is a risk that should not be allowed to occur. We believe that the complete separation of the Auditor-General from the executive and from the daily workings of the parliament is a very good principle that ought to be continued. The Auditor-General's reports are extensively debated in this place and no-one wants to diminish that practice, but his reports should be dealt with at arms length from the parliamentary process. He tables his reports and the parliament can then choose to debate, argue, amend and criticise them accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Auditor-General comes before the committee, as he obviously will, an intimacy will develop between the members of the committee and the Auditor-General which we believe would be unhealthy. While the Auditor-General may be conducting an investigation into a government department according to the act, I think senators and members of the House of Representatives would find it too tempting to make comments to the Auditor-General, seek his view about how a particular investigation was going, attempt to influence the way that investigation was going or, at the very least, make political capital and raise an issue. This could affect the perception of the independence of that investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We strongly oppose this recommendation. We are not opposed to proper parliamentary supervision, and we think that is there at the moment. Whether you are in opposition or in government, the principal issue here is the relationship between the Auditor-General and the parliament under our system. This is not an amendment that should be embarked upon lightly. I am not suggesting that the opposition and the Democrats are putting it up lightly, but there are some fundamental issues here, and we ask the Senate to oppose the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Schacht for his comments. The present Public Accounts Committee has a lot of dealings with the Auditor-General right now. So to say that there will be much change in that regard is simply not true. As described in report 331 of the committee, various witnesses at the public hearings pointed out that it would be better to have the Auditor-General's office reporting to a committee which has built up expertise on the running of the audit office over some years, and that committee, rather than a separate committee, should meet as the audit committee of parliament with specific duties as laid out in the amendments.

<PARA>Paragraph (m) is what the committee would do. In the first paragraphs I read out&mdash;certainly (i), (j) and (k) and maybe (l)&mdash;it is quite clear that the committee will have an influence over the priorities of the Auditor-General when he is conducting his inquiries. As I understand it, that does not apply at the moment to any of the parliamentary standing committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that this is the beginning of going down the slippery dip on the independence of the Auditor-General. If the Auditor-General refuses the comment, direction or advice from the committee, does the committee then move a motion condemning the Auditor-General? What happens then? Does the Auditor-General just ignore it? I think that is all a bit pointless. If he ignores it, over a period of time he will be criticised in this place and in the House of Representatives by those members of the committee who made their view known that his priority was to investigate departments A, B and C, various GBEs and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us face it: the temptation for whoever is in opposition&mdash;whether it is Labor, which may be many years off, Democrats or Liberals&mdash;to have a fishing expedition and raise an issue by saying to the Auditor-General, `I've heard some scuttlebutt about a particular department. Let's go after them,' will occur from time to time. We believe that that will add a politicisation to the process that will not be good for the committee, and I do not think it will be very good for the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the government, I warn the opposition and the Democrats that this amendment will have the consequence&mdash;and I do not think the opposition and the Democrats are aware of this&mdash;of politicising the process. It will create pressure on the Auditor-General to respond to a party political view about where he should be conducting his investigations. That is for whoever who is in opposition. You would be a mug to be in opposition and not have a go when you think there is an area that you can make political capital out of. I do not think the Auditor-General should be put in that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the parliament now has a more than adequate ability to comment publicly in both houses about what it  thinks the role of the Auditor-General ought be. We have more than enough opportunities to ask the Auditor-General to appear before joint committees, Senate committees and House of Representatives committees. Last year and the year before the opposition had the Auditor-General before the estimates committee over the rent he was paying at Centenary House in Canberra. That is a legitimate issue, whatever you think of the argument, and it is right that people can raise it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That shows that there will be a temptation on whoever is in opposition. I am not being partisan about this. If we were in opposition, an opposition senator or member would be tempted to tell the Auditor-General to investigate a particular issue. We would do this because we could make political capital out of it. Therefore, those amendments indicate to us that there is a concern that the process would lead to unnecessary pressure on the independence of the Auditor-General. </PARA>

We are suggesting the Auditor-General be advised by the committee that the committee express its preferences but the Auditor-General does not have to accept them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to make a few comments about a speech by Ms Eva Cox, co-convenor of the Women's Economic Think Tank who spoke in Canberra a couple of weeks ago to celebrate International Women's Day, an event which attracted quite some media attention. I want to draw to the attention of the Senate some of the things that she said in the course of that speech which I think are noteworthy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She made the point that, in her view, mothers at home should stop asking the government for money and stop making women who work feel guilty. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . once your kid is 12 months old . . . you should be able to spend some time away from them, even before. Its good for the kids, its good for the adults&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>She claimed that the government spent $6 billion to support women at home compared with only $600 million on child care. She also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the people who benefit from having a woman at home is the man, not the community, not necessarily the children.</PARA>
<PARA>I found those comments unbelievable, extraordinary and, in many ways, very sad. I think that is the emotion that many people felt when they heard what Ms Cox was saying. The hostility that Ms Cox clearly has towards mothers who sacrifice an income to care for their children at home really is quite sad and something that is an ugly development in the whole question of feminist politics. What Ms Cox and her ilk are really doing is almost declaring war from their point of view on women who stay at home with their children. Really, if you examine what she said in her speech, most of her comments were either wrong, misleading or unfair, or a combination of all those factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was pretty clear to me that what Ms Cox was on about was an attack on the campaign by Mrs Carole Carroll of Adelaide who has formed an organisation called Choice for Families and has lead a campaign nationwide to draw this nation's attention to the fact that mothers at home with young children have received very unfair treatment from this government. Of course, Mrs Carroll and Ms Cox faced each other on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> as a result of Ms Cox's speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My point tonight is to make it clear that, in my view, the government itself is largely responsible for the  bitterness and division between women in the full-time work force and women who are caring for their children at home and the government must take responsibility for what I regard as a very sad development among women in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Senate would know, Mrs Carroll's campaign, which has received nationwide attention and nationwide support, resulted from the inequity in government policy, particularly in relation to the home child-care allowance and the child-care cash rebate. As most senators would be aware, the child-care cash rebate paid to mothers who are in the full-time work force with children in child care has no income test at all. You can, as a woman, earn hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and receive the benefit, and it is paid at double the rate of the home child-care allowance for a mother of two. Of course, for a mother of two, the home child-care allowance has a very severe income test. So it is clearly unfair to mothers who sacrifice an income to care for their children at home on those two grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to Ms Cox, it must be pointed out that, despite Ms Cox's claims, Mrs Carroll and her supporters have not asked for more money from the government. All they are asking for is just and fair and equitable distribution of the funding that the government currently provides for women who have young children. It should be pointed out to Ms Cox that the government's very own National Council for the International Year of the Family recognised the significant problems that have arisen as a result of the introduction of the home child-care allowance and the child-care cash rebate and the inequities that have occurred. The Cass report&mdash;that is, the report of the National Council for the International Year of the Family chaired by Professor Cass&mdash;has called for the amalgamation of these two payments because of the problems engendered by them. The Cass report recognised this very point I am trying to make tonight&mdash;that government policy is dividing women who are at home with their children and women in the full-time work force, and that is an undesirable development in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I think the Cass report heads in the right direction. The government should acknowledge the costs of bringing up young children, but it should do so in a way which does not base the support on whether or not the children are in child care or at home or whether or not the mother is in the full-time work force. The payment should be based solely on the fact that there are children to be looked after. So the Cass report is to be commended for the direction in which it heads. The government said that it would respond quickly to that report, which came out in November-December. We have had no response whatsoever and I look forward to the government dealing with this report properly in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The point is that government policy, quite clearly, is loaded in favour of full-time work and the child-care option. Government documents and rhetoric are loaded with the flavour that policy should be directed at increasing the female participation rate in the work force, that policy should be aimed to that end; therefore child care should be provided and money should be spent on child care. I remind the Senate that there has been a 17 per cent increase in real terms every year for the last 10 years in government funding of child care. This is a massive increase. In fact, expenditure on child care is going to double between 1992-93 and 1996-97. In only a four-year period, expenditure will go from something like $500 million to $1,000 million. So it is nonsense for Ms Cox to claim that there is some bias the other way. That is simply not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, to contradict Ms Cox, it is mothers at home who now feel guilty. They are the ones who feel that society is pressuring them to place their children in child care and enter the full-time work force despite their desire to care for their children at home full time. There is no doubt that the contribution of mothers at home is unrecognised by society and it is a great pity that the Ms Coxes of the world do not recognise the contribution and the sacrifices made by mothers at home caring for their young children. Certainly the Australian Family Association petition calling for a homemakers allowance which has had a most massive response is an indication of the community feeling that really the contribution of mothers at home is not recognised. For Ms Cox to say that only men benefit from a mother being at home with her children really can only be described as stone age feminism. Most feminists nowadays reject that and the enlightened feminists recognise the importance of giving credit to those mothers who do sacrifice an income to care for their children at home. They do make a very big contribution to our society and to the care of our children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to Ms Cox, I think what she must recognise and what the government must recognise is the need to focus policy on providing choice for families. Mrs Carroll's organisation is most aptly named. That is what families are looking for from the government&mdash;neutrality in policy and the maximum provision of choice in the arrangements that families make as to the care of their children. The government should be giving families the maximum opportunity possible to choose the arrangements that they think are most suitable to their family environment and to their children. Government policy should be neutral on the question of whether children are in child care or cared for at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud the recent speeches by our new leader, John Howard, on this very subject. He has made it quite clear that this will be one of our most important themes as we run up to the next election. I conclude by saying that Ms Cox's outburst two weeks ago was most unfortunate, a very sad development, but the blame for the division which clearly exists can be laid fairly and squarely at the government's door. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some time ago in the adjournment debate I spoke of my concern about the global arms trade and about Australia's contribution through  its arms sales into our own region. In the era after the Cold War and the Gulf War, we can set long-term foreign policy goals and act on them since there is no immediate threat to Australia. One goal can be to try to avoid setting the stage for future conflicts. With the exception of Japan, the arms importers in our region are all poor countries. India, the number one importer, is desperately poor, with a per capita income of $335 per year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the end of the Cold War it makes little sense to pour arms into our troubled region. Yet at times the Australian government tries to make a case for it. However, this is a recent development. Earlier government statements opposed the escalation of the arms trade. In 1986 the then foreign minister, Bill Hayden, told the United Nations that `arms transfers should not become a new cash crop'. Bill Hayden, a humanist, agrees on this point with the Catholic Church. The new catechism contains the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arms race does not assure peace; far from eliminating the causes of war, it risks aggravating them. Squandering untold wealth on the purchase of ever-newer arms impedes efforts to help needy populations and thwarts the development of peoples. Over-armament multiplies reasons for conflict and increases the danger of escalation.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, the catechism says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arms production and trafficking affect the common good of nations and the international community. Hence public authorities have the right and duty to regulate them. The short-term pursuit of private or collective interests cannot justify enterprises that promote violence and conflict among nations and compromise the international juridical order.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet, despite these objections, the operation of the guidelines on arms transfer put out by the Ministry of Defence are not subject to public scrutiny, so they are not meaningful regulations. The Minister of Defence can approve transfers with no public review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that it is not in the public interest for this to continue. They have placed before the Senate a bill to provide for a public inquiry into Australia's real defence and security needs. The Democrats argue that South East Asian countries are upgrading their armaments. We believe that these arms transfers to the area will lessen Australia's security&mdash;and for the following reasons: firstly, by arming a repressive government we may arm a future enemy. If that government is overthrown, the new government is likely to be an enemy of Australia. Arming potential enemies lessens Australia's security. Secondly, resources in Third World countries devoted to armaments lessen the ability of the government to meet human and environmental needs. Australia will also be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there an example where supplying arms to an area, building up or updating armaments has increased security? Has there been a study of the political, economic, social and environmental effects of arms transfers into the South East Asian countries? If not, would it not be wise to make one before putting more arms into the area? Human rights violations have a greater importance in the arms trade than in any other type of trade. Selling shoes to an oppressive country does not add to the misery of the people; selling arms does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Military spending is declining for the first time in our lifetime. At this rate of decline, there could be a total peace dividend of $2,000 billion in the 1990s: $1,600 billion in the developed world and $400 billion in the developing world. Except for the arms dealers, the arms makers and military bureaucrats, the arms trade is against Australia's best interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1789 William Wilberforce introduced his first parliamentary resolution to outlaw the trade in human flesh. In 1789 the trade in human flesh was accepted and legal. Eventually, the whole world outlawed slavery as well as the slave trade.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to refer briefly to the by-election held in Canberra last Saturday, which was won so convincingly by the Liberal Party and its candidate, Brendan Smyth, who will shortly take his place as the member for Canberra in the other place. There was an enormous amount of literature placed in letterboxes, most of it from the Labor Party. I heard of people who said that they had had five or six pieces of literature placed in their letterbox over the relevant period. I shall certainly be interested to find out exactly how much the Labor Party spent on the campaign when it is all disclosed&mdash;certainly it was a vastly greater sum than we were able to spend. One pamphlet, I would estimate, must have cost nearly as much as our whole campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting letters was from Dr Carmen Lawrence which was sent out purporting to be an individual, personally addressed letter to women in Canberra. But, in fact, that letter was virtually identical to one she wrote last year for the electorate of Torrens in South Australia for the election on 7 May there. I just want to point out, in a sense, the cynicism of this letter and the way it was used. I also wish to place the letter on the record because no doubt Dr Lawrence will continue to do this type of thing in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and second paragraphs of the two letters are identical. The third paragraph of the letter distributed in Canberra mentions the name `Sue Robinson', `Canberra', and `25 March 1995'; the South Australian letter includes the words `Robyn Geraghty', `Torrens', and `May 7'. In the next paragraph, comparing the two letters, the only difference is `Sue' in one and `Robyn' in the other. In the next paragraph, the letters are slightly more personalised: one mentions `Sue Robinson' and her husband's name and that she had `lived and worked in Canberra'; the other letter, of course, mentions `Robyn Geraghty', her children and `the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next sentence of that paragraph is identical in both letters, which is why I suggest that the whole exercise is somewhat cynical. Maybe it is just a coincidence that the two women were so similar. In each it says:</PARA>

<PARA>The next paragraph refers to each of them having been community workers, one for six years, one for eight years, and again says of each of them `has taken on government departments to solve the problems of ordinary people'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have received a letter from a constituent which deserves wider circulation. It is an open letter to the Hon. Paul Keating, the Prime Minister of Australia. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Family Affairs Minister, Senator Rosemary Crowley, has shown a callous disregard for the sensitivities of the family of a girl who tragically died as a consequence of tampon induced toxic shock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By releasing to the media details of the confidential medical history of this young girl, Crowley has caused deep embarrassment and heartache to her grieving parents and family. She has also wantonly pre-empted the coronial inquiry into this tragic death. This disgraceful and inexcusable action sits uneasily with your alleged concern for individual privacy which you relied on to enact your Sexual Practices Privacy Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Crowley's pathetic excuse for this flagrant abuse of confidentiality is that some journalists requested it. If this is the standard by which your ministers operate, how can you indulge in self-righteous indignation over the `secret women's business' letter, the veracity of which is rightly subject to some suspicion?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This latest gaff is but a further example of the double standards which have become a hallmark of your government's arrogant contempt for the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Health Minister, Carmen Lawrence, also exhibited that same contempt by endorsing and funding the obnoxious Cleo safe sex guide, which was nothing more than a catalogue of perversion and obscene sexual practices. This action has outraged not only Christian and Jewish citizens, but all right-thinking Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have scaled the height of crass hypocrisy with your claim that it was wanton cynicism to interfere with sacred Aboriginal documents and that no person who is party to such wanton cynicism is entitled to propose himself to be the first minister of the Australian Government. What utter humbug!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Carmen Lawrence's actions have, to quote your own words, "transgressed territory sacred to the ancient cultures" of Judaism and Christianity, yet you permit her to remain in your Ministry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians are entitled to ask you if you, as an alleged Christian and father, endorse and approve the scandalous advice to young Australians contained in the Cleo sex guide. If not, how can you in good conscience allow Lawrence to retain her portfolio?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prime Minister, your rhetoric and pious and strident protestations about political integrity now have a very hollow ring. If you wish to retain any vestige of your fast diminishing credibility, you have no alternative but to cull your Cabinet of such callous and incompetent ministers as Crowley and Lawrence and that charlatan Tickner, whose clumsy machinations further taint your lamentable record of gross mismanagement of policies to advance the health and welfare of Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Charles J. Connelly,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for and on behalf of the above Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Committee for Integrity in Government. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">P.S.Prime Minister, if you believe your formidable reputation as a brawling debater equips you to make a rational and reasoned response to the matters of substance I have raised in this letter, would you be prepared to respond publicly?</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I am saying, Sir, would you have the moral courage to debate these issues with me in any public forum on such reasonable terms and conditions as you may nominate.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Knowing your reputation as a "hit and run" media manipulator, I will not be surprised if you decline to accept this challenge, such is the nature of bully and bluff people like yourself.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do feel very out of place. Perhaps I should adjourn my speech and continue it tomorrow. But I will take this opportunity to speak on a matter that I raised in the Senate several weeks ago. It relates to the portfolio of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Punch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 6 February I brought up a matter of bureaucratic error committed by the Australian Defence Force that led to a grievance for a Gold Coast family, the family of Lieutenant John Fraser who died serving his country in the Vietnam War back in 1968. The family received a letter from the Australian Defence Force addressed `John Fraser', the deceased John Fraser. That hurt is accentuated for anyone knowing the story of Lieutenant Fraser, a story that has been told many times in the Senate. To the people of the Gold Coast he is an unsung hero of that war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I placed a petition with the minister on 6 February and, with all the goodwill of the old style hands-on politician that he is, Mr Punch swiftly moved to address the matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is a good minister. Senator Herron does not give away such compliments lightly, as anyone who heard his earlier contribution to this debate would know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second point also relates to the good minister&mdash;at least for this week&mdash;Mr Punch. If the reports are correct, he has moved to review the decision of previous governments not to establish the end of war list. I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 26 March 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government is ready to heal one of the last wounds of the Vietnam War by reviewing a controversial 1972 decision not to award military honours to some Australian soldiers who committed acts of heroism.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Defence Personnel, Mr Punch, has ordered the Department of Defence to review the 1972 decision by the McMahon Government&mdash;later confirmed by the Whitlam Government&mdash;not to create a so-called end of war list after the Vietnam War.</PARA>
<PARA>I urge Mr Punch not to be swayed from this task. It can be done. The mechanisms are there, if not simple. I know that some of his advisers will say that he is in danger of lifting the expectations of and potentially disappointing the people and the families of people from that time. I have heard all those arguments in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mere establishment of the tribunal is the completion of the minister's responsibility. It is the very final step in bringing home our soldiers. It may be that few cases can properly be investigated; it may be that, on investigation, cases may warrant only honourable mention. Those pushing for an end of war list understand that and have always understood it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no argument to say that too much time has elapsed to investigate acts of heroism. After all, in this parliament we passed the War Crimes Amendment Bill that sought justice some 50 years after the Second World War. The justice there was the seeking of war criminals. The end of war list similarly seeks justice in seeking heroes some 30 years after the Vietnam War. I urge the minister to plough on with his intent, to pass all the hurdles that might be put in front of him because it is a cause most worthy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Agreement on Agriculture contains concessions and commitments on market access, domestic support and export subsidies. A formula-based approach was agreed as the basic framework for the negotiations on agriculture with separate, specific reductions in these three areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Uruguay Round commitments are to be undertaken over the six-year implementation period of the Round, commencing in 1995 for developed countries. For developing countries the implementation period is 10 years.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the implementation process, a Committee on Agriculture will be established to monitor the implementation of commitments under the Agriculture Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non-tariff barriers for agricultural products (such as import restrictions, non-automatic import licensing, voluntary restraint arrangements, import prohibitions) have been tariffied under the requirements of the Uruguay Round Agriculture Agreement. The conversion of these barriers to tariff equivalents (often at very high and prohibitive levels) has therefore required the opening of tariff quotas at lower tariff rates to allow trade to flow. The administration and implementation of these arrangements will be important in determining the level of Australia's access to those markets which were previously closed or significantly impeded by non-tariff barriers. All WTO members' Uruguay Round obligations, including tariff quota commitments, will come under close scrutiny when they are notified to the Committee on Agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tariffication of non-tariff barriers is the first step towards removing the impediments to trade in agricultural products.
