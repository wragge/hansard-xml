<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Customs Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1994 No 435</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations amend the Principal Regulations as a result of amendments to Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing regimes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the amendments confer wide discretions on the Minister. Subregulations 180(6) and (7) and 181(4) and (6) provide that, if the Minister is satisfied that there is insufficient information to enable certain costs or profits to be calculated, then the Minister may determine an amount having regard to all relevant information, and may disregard any information that he or she considers to be unreliable. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking confirmation that the exercise of these significant discretions, as well as the others in the Regulations, is subject to independent review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Income Tax Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1994 No 461</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations provide rules for the calculation of transitional Reasonable Benefit Levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments confer significant discretions on the Commissioner. Proposed regulation 51 provides that the Commissioner may determine Reasonable Benefit Limits at a rate higher than the Regulations provide in special circumstances. Also, the Commissioner may permit registration of a transitional RBL at a date later than the specified cut-off-date. Each of these decisions might have significant financial consequences. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking confirmation that the exercise of these discretions is subject to independent review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTUDY Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1994 No 409</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among other things, the Regulations make changes to income calculations and rent assistance, abolish the Student Assistance Review Tribunal and transfer its functions to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and make changes to fit in with the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amending regulation 36.2 adds subregulations (4)-(6) to regulation 108. These amendments confer important discretions on the Secretary to suspend and recommence the payment of benefits. The subregulations also omit the Note to regulation 108, which advised of a right of appeal to the Student Assistance Review Tribunal. Elsewhere, the Regulations confer the review functions of the Student Assistance Review Tribunal on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking confirmation that regulation 108 decisions by the Secretary will be reviewable by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The Committee has also asked for advice on some minor drafting errors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Remuneration Tribunal Determinations Nos 30 and 33 of 1994, made under the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Determinations make variations to the recreation leave entitlements of certain office holders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Determination No 30, which varies Determination No 20 of 1991, appears to have taken effect retrospectively from 10 December 1991. Determination No 33 then repeals Determination No 20 of 1991 with effect from 19 December 1994. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking confirmation that the retrospective operation of Determination No 30 can prejudicially affect no-one other than the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Civil Aviation Orders Part 105 AD/F27/103 Amdt 6, made under the Civil Aviation Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This instrument amends the Schedule of Airworthiness Directives for Fokker F27 Series Aeroplanes by incorporating modifications specified in the Fokker Structural Integrity Program and Subsequent Temporary Revisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the Committee's previously expressed view of the operation of s.49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, that a regulation may incorporate matter contained in a non-statutory instrument only as that instrument is in force at the time the regulation takes effect, this would seem to prevent the incorporation of "subsequent Temporary Revisions" in the Directive. However, the Committee understands that s.98(3A) of the Civil Aviation Act 1988 enables regulations made under that Act to incorporate other written instruments as in force not only at the time the regulation takes effect, but as in force from time to time. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice as to the effect of s.49A on instruments such as Airworthiness Directives, which are not strictly regulations, but are made by virtue of regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Civil Aviation Orders, Section 40.1.0, made under the Civil Aviation Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This instrument makes a number of amendments to the Section in relation to aircraft endorsements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a number of cases these amendments confer discretions on the Authority. For example, an amendment to subparagraph 6.1(c) proposes to replace the objective phrase "overseas aeroplane type endorsement that" with the subjective phrase "overseas aeroplane endorsement that the Authority is satisfied". These discretions may be of considerable commercial value. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking confirmation that their exercise will be subject to some form of independent review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Rules of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1994 No 464</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among other things, the Rules make amendments relating to certification of agreements, approvals of enterprise flexibility agreements and appeals under the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New paragraphs 30A(3)(cc) and 30G(3)(fb) provide that an application for certification must, among other things, state the number of employees covered by the agreement who are included in each of seven classes of person. Also, paragraphs 30A(3)(d) and (e), and paragraphs 30G(3)(g) and (h), require the specification of employees, other than those included in the seven classes, who may be relevant employees under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under s.170MG of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 the Commission is required to identify employees whose interests may not have been sufficiently taken into account in the terms of a certified agreement. This section refers only to employees in three specified categories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on the legality and appropriateness of the Commission going beyond the three statutory categories, and on the lack of certainty involved in requiring the identification of other employees whose interests may not have been taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Statistics Determination (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1994 No 465</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations authorise the Commonwealth Statistician to disclose certain types of information in particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the information released under these provisions might be sensitive. Its disclosure seems to be a matter where the Privacy Commissioner should be consulted as a matter of course. However, the Explanatory Statement makes no reference to any such discussions. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking confirmation that such consultations have occurred.</PARA>

Why can't it get its program in reasonable order so that bills can be dealt with during the course of the sittings rather than constantly building up to this backlog at the end of the sitting? The consequence of that, whether we sit late or not, is that bills are not dealt with in the way this chamber would like to handle legislation; that is, to do it properly. This is the house of review, the house of scrutiny of legislation in the Australian parliament, and we should be given reasonable time to do our job properly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government changed the procedures to three sittings each year and said that bills would now be introduced in a way that they might be dealt with orderly and that such time would be allowed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I appreciate the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) taking the Senate into his confidence and giving us some warning about the matter. I would also say to him that, as I see it, there are 18 pieces of legislation to be determined between now and the time we get up. The second reading debate has already finished on at least a half a dozen of those pieces of legislation. Most of the legislation is now at the committee stage. I imagine there will be one other&mdash;and that will be the Land Fund Bill&mdash;that is not listed here for consideration and presumably those for which you have sought exemption from Senator Chamarette's cut-off motion of November last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the manager of government business, when discussing the matters with us, should canvass whether or not those particular pieces of legislation are urgent. I agree with what Senator Hill said. Those that are not urgent should be put over to the next session and we can then deal with them at that particular stage. I feel that the extra time should be sought on the basis of what are the urgent pieces of legislation and what are the times that the government considers need to be devoted to those particular pieces of legislation. I emphasise to the minister through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that he should now set down what are the urgent pieces of legislation and what are the times that the government considers those pieces of legislation deserve for debate in the second reading stage, in the committee stage and so on. Then he should let us have a good talk about that. </PARA>

I know Senator Herron has done a medical report on that particular question, as I think the manager of government business knows full well. I am sure that he is not terribly anxious to extend the sittings of the parliament into the evening. I think those three matters that I mentioned ought to be considered: what are the urgent bills; how long does the government propose that we spend on those bills for the second reading stage and for the committee stage to conclude the passage or otherwise of the legislation, and; finally, is there any other way that we can deal with extra hours that are thus required other than sitting until quite late?</PARA>

I have spoken to Senator Hill privately on no less than three occasions, and all other senators, about my intention over this last sitting fortnight.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take account of the point that Senator Alston made. It is very difficult to predict what will occur in terms of some parts of the Senate's routine of business. I do not think it is possible for any government, or really any senator in this chamber, to rub a crystal ball and predict what is going to occur. We had matters such as urgency motions and MPIs and the like in the last sitting period. We had a situation where the sitting of the Senate was suspended for a day as a result of the death of Senator Zakharov. It is not easy to be able to make assessments about these things early in the sittings. At this stage, of course, we have had 60 per cent of the sitting time and dealt with about 30 per cent of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I want to do in response to Senator Harradine's question&mdash;he and other senators have the value of the forward legislative program for these two weeks of sittings&mdash;is to talk these issues through in terms of senators' availability for evening sittings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Chamarette moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 1392 standing in her name for this day, relating to the consideration of the Racial Hatred Bill 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>I will speak only briefly on this matter. I do not intend to delay the Senate but I believe this is a matter of urgency. I will not be debating the content of this notice, but merely the need for urgency; the need to pass this motion today. I gave notice originally on 6 March as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That further consideration of the Government Business order of the day relating to the Racial Hatred Bill 1994 be postponed to the day of sitting immediately after the release of the findings of the committee established by the Attorney-General to review the ability of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to make determinations following the decision of the High Court in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The reason for giving that notice&mdash;and it was requested that it be considered as a formal motion&mdash;was the obvious concern that the operations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission have been affected by that determination in the High Court. It seemed obvious to me that, because the Racial Hatred Bill is so dependent on the operation and constitutionality of the operation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, it was appropriate that that question of its constitutionality be resolved prior to debate on the Racial Hatred Bill 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was pointed out to me that if the Attorney-General's committee was to do a thorough job it might take a considerable time and this might constitute an unreasonable delay, especially in light of the fact that the Attorney-General's Department has been working on some amendments to restore the constitutionality of the operation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That is why the amendments merely add, `or the day of sitting after the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 has been amended by the parliament to ensure its constitutionality in the light of the decision of the High Court in Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, whichever is the sooner.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for today both those bills appear in sequence with the first being the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 and the resumption of the second reading debate. I believe the government is putting amendments that would, in its view, restore the constitutionality of operation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. However, we have not been through that consideration and those amendments have not been supported in the Senate. Neither, as yet, have we heard any assurance about the reception they might get in the House of Representatives. For that reason it is urgent to put this motion that we successfully deal with the first matter which I believe will affect the consideration of the second matter, the Racial Hatred Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Racial Hatred Bill comes immediately after the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill, in my view, does not necessarily deal with the concerns because there may be a delay or a deferment of that first matter in which case we would move to the second. Because that is inappropriate, I wish to move urgent consideration of the motion that we delay considering the Racial Hatred Bill until after the successful completion of consideration of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. The motion is self-explanatory. I trust that my colleagues will see the logic of it and accept that this is a sensible motion in relation to having logical and sequential debate in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition does not support this motion being made formal, albeit it is very much in support of the principle behind the motion and is in support of the spirit of what the Greens are trying to do. What they are basically saying is that we should not be asked to deal with the Racial Hatred Bill 1994 until these matters have been resolved one way or the other. We need the release of the findings of the committee established by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) or to have the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act amended in such a way as to fix the errors isolated by the Brandy decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than support this motion and lock us into following its exact wording, we would prefer to maintain a degree of good faith with the government. When the human rights legislation comes on for debate, we will say that it is fine for the government to introduce its amendments but after that we want the matter postponed. We want it postponed because it should go through the proper processes. It is one thing to deliver some amendments and have some officers of the department and officers from the minister's office say, `These amendments are all okay,' but it is another for an opposition to say, `Yes that's all right. Parliament will sit and just rubber-stamp this little private conversation that we had and that I had with some officers this morning.' I was offered a telephone brief on Friday I think on these amendments. That is clearly not the way parliament should work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments are in response to a decision of the High Court. Parliament is not only entitled but also obligated to go through the amendments and ensure that they are what they purport to be, which is a simple turning back to the pre-1992 position. I spoke to the officers this morning and asked, `Is that all there is?' One said, `It is just going back to 1992.' I asked a simple question: what about the delegation powers? I was told that there were a few minor extra things. They might be right in that the extra things, the changes, over and above shifting back to 1992 might be minor. Senator Chamarette, Senator Harradine and I might agree with them. We all might agree with them. All we are saying is that parliament is entitled to look at them first and give them proper assessment. For my part, I want to take them to my shadow ministry and then to my party room. I want to give everybody who is elected, paid as a member of parliament and obligated to look at these things properly the opportunity to consider what is in these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There should be no difficulty in dealing with that course. If, as the government says, the amendments it wants to move to that bill are relatively minor in that they either simply put it back to the 1992 position or make some very minor inconsequential amendments, there will be no problem. They will go to my shadow ministry on Monday, be dealt with on Tuesday and could be debated here Tuesday afternoon. I do not think that is a lot to ask for amendments that were delivered to me on Friday. In fact, it is improper of a government to ask for them to be dealt with any sooner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then it would be sensible immediately after the human rights legislation to deal with the Racial Hatred Bill. We assume that the government in good faith&mdash;we will take it on good faith at the moment&mdash;wants this matter to be fixed. It clearly sees by the listing it has put on the order of business that it is sensible to deal with the Racial Hatred Bill after the human rights legislation has been dealt with in this chamber. On that basis, we would look to having the human rights amendments shifted until next week so that they can go through the proper processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We agree with the government's scheduling and ordering that the Racial Hatred Bill should come after that. On that point, I think Senator Chamarette is in agreement. What she is concerned with is that it will try to proceed in any event if there is a problem with the human rights amendments. We are saying, `Why don't we wait and see? Why don't we assume good faith? Assume that the government is simply wanting to put it back to the pre-1992 position. Assume good faith on the part of the officers I spoke to this morning who said that the other amendments are minor and inconsequential.' If all that is the case, there should be no problem in proceeding with this next week. I say to Senator Chamarette that, if we find that the government does not want to play ball and be sensible, we might have to look at dealing with this in another way on another day. Just for today, we are happy to say that we will put some good faith in the government and see whether it is prepared to deliver. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the comments of Senator Vanstone. It was only recently that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee looked into the Racial Hatred Bill and, in the course of that inquiry, took evidence from the Attorney-General's Department. Extensive evidence was given as to the ramifications of the case of Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The ramifications are such that the determinations of such commissions do not have any sanction attached to them and that there are great problems in relation to the enforceability of those civil sections of the Racial Hatred Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became apparent during the taking of that evidence that this was indeed a complex area. This bill that has been put to us at the last minute has not provided us with any opportunity to closely scrutinise it, which is required of any responsible house of review as, after all, this Senate is. It particularly does not afford the opposition the democratic chance to inquire into this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no urgency as such for the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill to be dealt with today. No grand social damage will be caused by not dealing with it today. I support Senator Vanstone entirely when she says that this matter could easily be put off until next week. We would then have an opportunity to scrutinise this bill and ensure that it will do what it says it will do. After all, our role is not to simply accept proposed legislation on the face of it; our responsibility is to make legitimate inquiry and be afforded ample opportunity for scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean to say that you hold up the business of governing this country unnecessarily&mdash;quite the contrary&mdash;but there is no need for this bill to be foisted upon us. The first notice we had of it was last Friday and here we are on Tuesday expected to debate the bill. It is entirely inappropriate that that be done. The sensible course is to put this all off until next week. Then we can have a look at it and, all being well, move onto the Racial Hatred Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no attempt to delay that. There has been due inquiry into it by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, but there has not been due inquiry into this Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill, and that is what needs to be looked at. There is no question of suspicion or cynicism on our part. As Senator Vanstone says, we are taking this on the assumption that the government will be returning to the pre-1992 position. We just need one week, nothing more and nothing less, to have a look at it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the compromise as suggested by the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Vanstone, and also the comments of my colleague Senator Ellison. Senator Vanstone's proposal is a sensible compromise in all the circumstances, and I commend it to the Senate. All it does is defer the consideration of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill and the Racial Hatred Bill for a period of seven days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has had some considerable time to develop a racial hatred bill. In fact, it had one before the last election, withdrew it and reconsidered it. Although it is on the agenda of this country, it cannot be argued that it is of absolute vital importance it be dealt with today as opposed to next week. I do not think there is an argument for urgency. Nevertheless, there is an argument to ensure that it gets dealt with in due course. I would have thought a period of seven days would fit into that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This house is supposedly a house of review. It is vital in the discharge of that function for us to look at the legislation, consider it and, if appropriate, seek some independent legal advice apart from that which comes from the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my brief period in this place, on a number of occasions I have seen the Attorney-General's Department give legal advice and considered opinions to Senate committees. While clearly given in good faith, at the end of the day they were overruled by the High Court of Australia. Therefore, it is appropriate for an opposition to seek advice from outside the Attorney-General's Department and, indeed, to rely on the legal brains within the ranks of the opposition&mdash;people such as the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Ellison, Daryl Williams QC in the other place, and other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But for that to occur, we need more than just the Friday, when we were given notice of this bill, an intervening long weekend, and the Senate resuming today. I believe that it is appropriate, as suggested by the shadow Attorney-General, that we accept the government at face value but ask that we be given appropriate time to consider the proposed amendments to ensure that we on this side of the chamber are satisfied as to the propriety of the amendments, the legality of the amendments and their implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could not face the people of Australia if we said that we just took the government at face value without looking into this in any way, shape or form ourselves. We need to satisfy ourselves that the proposals are appropriate and I would anticipate, without having gone into it at any great depth at this stage, that that would be our finding. Nevertheless, we have to give it due consideration. I believe that the delay of one week, as proposed by Senator Vanstone, is appropriate and I commend that course to the Senate. </PARA>

At that particular meeting on that particular day, which was before the decision in the High Court, the question was raised as to whether we should delay this matter until after we had heard what the High Court said.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying when this motion was last before the Senate, this is certainly an issue for which there is a desperate need for more information. Mr Acting Deputy President, you might recall that back in 1992 the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology recommended that Queensland not be included in the initial assessment of the possible national electricity grid extensions until it could be demonstrated that its inclusion could be achieved economically. The government response to that recommendation of the committee was as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main concern of the Committee over the Northlink proposal derives from the view that transmission losses could erode the environmental benefits of the sharing of spinning reserve, with consequent fuel savings. The economic benefits of new links are addressed in response to Recommendation 6. However, such grid augmentations or extensions should only proceed where they can be demonstrated to be economic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major part of the assessment work being carried out by the States is to determine the economic merits of various proposals. At the present time Queensland is considering the construction of new generating capacity to meet the State's projected electricity needs from the end of the decade and beyond. The Commonwealth considers that this evaluation should also consider the merits of Northlink, which would enable the construction of expensive new capacity in Queensland to be delayed. The link would enable some of Queensland's power needs to be met by New South Wales which has considerable excess capacity.</PARA>
<PARA>That was how this matter was first raised. There is no doubt that many people in my state of Queensland have a very great concern. I know my colleague Senator Boswell and my other Senate colleagues Senator MacGibbon, Senator Herron, Senator Parer and Senator O'Chee, and I believe all of my Labor Senate colleagues as well, have received a great many letters and a great many representations from people about this issue. There are a myriad of those. I will quote some words from a submission that a person made to the Senate standing committee considering the Eastlink proposal. The excerpts from that letter I refer to indicate some of the concerns being expressed. The letter indicated that the writer was concerned about, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . injustices imposed upon a minority in the name of progress supported by the majority. Eastlink will also have severe environmental effects, both physical and aesthetic, and the decision-makers do not have to live with these effects every day of their lives as people in and near the path of the cables are expected to do.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The so-called consultation going on now is no more than a public relations exercise to try to placate opposition as the important decisions have already been made.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The level of compensation spoken of is TOTALLY INADEQUATE. Farms and properties are being made inoperable by restrictions on land use in the vicinity of the cables which can only get worse if overseas experience is any guide. People's lives and futures are being destroyed. To many ageing farmers their farm is also their future retirement and reflects a lifetime of effort.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this project is to go ahead, and it should not for a host of reasons, TOTAL BUYOUT of all affected properties where owners want that, at prices that include a premium on PRE-EASTLINK and pre-drought prices, plus compensation for dislocation/relocation is the only way for fairness to apply. If this is not done, the minority bear the cost while the majority get the benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are just some excerpts. Further, a number of petitions have been forwarded to all members of the Senate in which the point is made by petitioners that the proposal is contrary to the recommendations of the Senate standing committee to which I have referred. One of the petitions further indicates that Eastlink:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is proceeding without proper comparison of other options for meeting Queensland's future energy needs.</PARA>
<PARA>The petition states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been no proper comparison of impacts on rural productivity, economic, environment, health, development or lifestyle issues.</PARA>
<PARA>The petition further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Work on Eastlink easement acquisition occurred prior to parliamentary or public debate on the options for Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eastlink itself will not be adequate for Interstate trading and would entail considerable further upgrading and expenditure on . . . Lines and switching station.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are just some of the concerns. I emphasise that we have all received many more of those types of concerns over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter was raised in the estimates committee hearings in February because it was of great concern to me and involved the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth seemed to have little understanding, knowledge or even interest in the proposal at all. My understanding of the Eastlink proposal is that it is to be a third funded by the Commonwealth government. If that is the case, one would have thought that the Commonwealth would be intricately involved in what is happening with Eastlink. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of an enormous number of representations received from Queensland which indicate to my colleagues and I that work is about to commence, resumptions had begun and the procedure had gone to the point of no return, I tried to ask the Commonwealth government some questions about the matter at the Senate estimates committee hearings. When I asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, about the Eastlink process at the estimates hearing on 15 February relating to the primary industries and energy portfolio, he said&mdash;and this is page 101 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be quite a long process, as it always is with these transmission line proposals, to consult with all of the people.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on in that hearing I asked Senator Collins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can your department let me know what you have allocated towards the Eastlink project, what you have actually spent so far and where you have reached as far as your department is concerned?</PARA>
<PARA>In answer to that question Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will take that on the notice.</PARA>
<PARA>I then asked Senator Collins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is there just one line being looked at? It has been suggested to me that if you build one you then have to build a separate one in another position as a reserve, which I must confess I do not quite understand. Are you aware whether that is correct?</PARA>
<PARA>In answer to that question Senator Collins's said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is far too early to get into that detail.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked him later in the hearing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So you believe that it is still in its very early stages?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins responded by saying, `Yes'. Later on Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All I can say is that in terms of the detail of actual routeing of the line, which is all important to those concerns, there is a long way to go yet.</PARA>
<PARA>I raise those issues to indicate that, as far as I am concerned, the information I am getting from my constituents is quite different to the information I am getting from the Commonwealth government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having pursued the matter quite unsatisfactory at the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on 15 February, I then raised the matter with Senator Faulkner on 16 February at the environment estimates committee. I asked Senator Faulkner whether his department had been involved in any way in the path of the proposed major transmission lines. Senator Faulkner said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the answer is no, but I will just seek some advice from the world heritage unit officer.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Kay, the relevant officer, then came to the table and answered by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, we have had some involvement, as the Queensland electricity authorities have made public a number of proposed options and sought comment from us and from a whole series of other authorities on that. The proposed electricity transmission routes, or at least some of the proposed routes, have a proximity to the central eastern rainforests world heritage property. Our comment has really been in relation to that issue and that issue only. My understanding is that comments are still being sought on the report.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on in the hearing I asked whether those proposed routes traversed world heritage listed forests. Dr Kay said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, it includes several world heritage forests. The central eastern Australian rainforest is a single world heritage property. There are several compartments making up that single world heritage property. The range of routes have different impacts on different parts of the property. Some of the options, of course, are quite distant from the rainforests.</PARA>
<PARA>There was some understanding of the issue. Later on in the estimates committee hearing I asked some further questions. In answer to a question on where the actual routes went, Mr Carbon from the department said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May I indicate that there is not a proposed route.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what a senior officer from the department said. Mr Carbon then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister for the environment has yet to make a decision about how the Commonwealth will be involved in that. I understand that there is quite a bit of angst amongst the people out there, but the discussion is about choosing the preferred corridor stage for a proposal, rather that about a precise proposal at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA>In answer to a further question, Mr Carbon went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My understanding is that not only are routes being looked at but there are variations around those routes which are still being discussed, so there is not an exact proposal for even those particular three routes.</PARA>
<PARA>When I asked him whether he was aware of the ones that have been proposed, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not know the details of them. I am aware that there are multiple routes being looked at.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on I asked Mr Carbon a further question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage do you have any part in the consultation process with people living in these proposed areas?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Carbon replied, `None'. I have gone through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record of those Senate estimates hearings in some detail to indicate that there does not seem to be a lot of information on which senators could make a decision on this particular proposal. It is one that concerns me and my colleagues on this side of the chamber quite considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The coalition feels that, whilst Senator Woodley's proposal should not be rejected at this stage, we are not in a position to fully understand the exact position of the Commonwealth. Our concern at not having the information comes from those extracts that I have read from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. There seems to be some real misunderstanding in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. There seems to be a bit of uncertainty in the department of the environment. Compared with what we have been told by our constituents, it just does not seem to make sense. It is important that, before we embark on a major reference to the Senate Economics References Committee, we should be sure of our facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the matter is proposed to be referred to the Senate Economics References Committee which is chaired very capably by my good friend and colleague Senator Ferguson. That committee already has two rather major references before it. Whilst I cannot speak for the committee and whilst I am sure that Senator Ferguson and his committee would cooperate and accommodate the Senate as best they could, there are obviously some concerns in getting that committee to look at it at an early date&mdash;although I am sure the committee would do whatever is necessary to accommodate the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage of the debate&mdash;Senator Woodley having moved and spoken to this particular reference on behalf of the Democrats; Senator Faulkner having spoken on behalf of the government; and I having briefly indicated the coalition's position&mdash;I intend to move that the debate on this particular motion be adjourned to enable the Senate estimates committee to look further into this matter. I should just explain that statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we raised this matter at the Senate estimates committee and there was that uncertainty, it was then agreed by the Senate estimates committee that perhaps the best way to go about it would be to get a full briefing from the department of the environment and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. We can then find out exactly what the Commonwealth's involvement is; where the Commonwealth has got to; what expenditure the Commonwealth has made; and what power the Commonwealth has in relation to the matter. Senators would then be fully informed of all those aspects. Once we have that information, we on the coalition side feel that we would be much better able to make a sensible assessment of Senator Woodley's motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators will be aware that the briefing for the estimates committee was set down for the day that the Senate adjourned as a mark of respect following the passing of one of our colleagues, and so the briefing could not go ahead at that time. I understand that it was to be done this week, but it has just been pointed out to me by the chairman of that committee that it cannot actually happen this week because the briefing is for members as well as senators. A number of members of the lower house have been inextricably involved in this. Two members that I know for certain would want to be included are Mr Bill Taylor, the Liberal member for Groom, whose electorate is traversed by the path, and Mr Bruce Scott, the National Party member for Maranoa, again whose electorate is traversed by it. If it is not done this week, it will no doubt take place next week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My suggestion is that, the Democrats having spoken, the Labor Party having spoken and my having spoken on behalf of the coalition, we adjourn the debate to perhaps Wednesday of next week, depending on the Manager of Government Business, on the assumption that we might be able to have the briefing&mdash;I am not in a position to arrange this; committees have to make their own decisions&mdash;before the estimates committee on the Monday or Tuesday of next week. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Ian Macdonald has explained the position that the coalition finds itself in. I, too, have received numerous representations by mail and by phone from people, including state members of the various electorates that the powerlines are proposed to run through. All those people have supported Senator Woodley's motion for a Senate inquiry. We were proposing to do this last Tuesday but, as the previous speaker explained, the Senate, as a mark of respect, adjourned because of Senator Zakharov's untimely passing and that left us without the opportunity to have a briefing by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to have a Senate inquiry I think it is up to the whole Senate to get full information so that Senator Woodley's terms of reference can be agreed to. Alternatively, some information may come up in the briefing by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy that may cause us to want to amend, with Senator Woodley's agreement, his motion. We may come up with some other problems that are unforeseen at the moment. We may want to go to Senator Woodley and say, `There are certain problems here that aren't included in your terms of reference.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in the interest of getting the right result and getting full information, I think the right way to go is to seek that briefing by Wednesday next week and then, after having that briefing and having all the information that that briefing will allow us to get, to come back and put our position down.

<PARA>I understand there is a strong level of support for this motion in the chamber. In fact, the government amendment to the Senate cut-off order of 29 November replaces the two government notices of motion which were given on 7 February 1995 and on 6 March 1995. The Senate order of 29 November last year sought to give effect to the objective of making bills available for public scrutiny and consultations as early as possible. It reflects the government undertaking that had been given by Senator Gareth Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, on 18 August to work towards the objective of managing legislation on an introduce-one-session debate-the-next basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application of the order as currently worded has prevented, as I have mentioned on many occasions in the chamber, debate in the current sittings of the Senate on bills which have been introduced or passed in the House of Representatives in previous sittings. Strict application of the order as it currently stands would mean that it would take at least three sittings for such a bill to pass through the parliament. The government amendment to the order seeks to allow debate in the Senate on such bills in order to ensure that the passage of bills will not be unduly delayed in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a motion that is entirely consistent with the government's commitment to the objective of making bills available for examination and consultation as early as possible prior to debate in the Senate. The Senate order, if it is amended as proposed, will fully meet the objective of the principle of introducing a bill one session and debating it in the next session. The government will still need to seek exemption from the application of the order on a case-by-case basis, as senators are aware, for urgent bills and budget bills to be introduced and debated in the same sittings. This is a motion that will allow for good management of legislation in the Senate. It comprehensively allows us to meet and to manage the commitment that we made in relation to the introduction of legislation in one session and for debate in the next. I commend this important motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion, if carried, modifies the provision that is currently in place. Basically, the argument is put that if a bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives during a previous session then that is adequate notice for this chamber and gives senators warning that they can anticipate that it will be coming up in the next sittings of the parliament and they can be prepared for that debate. We, on this side of the chamber, accept that argument. That reasonably satisfies the issue of notice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue, however, is proper planning. The Senate simply having had notice that a bill is likely to be debated in the following sittings does not mean that the government will, within its planning of the program, allow adequate and proper time for the consideration of that bill. That is our disappointment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> Before the quorum I was arguing that, whilst the motion before the chamber may be sufficient to give the Senate notice of the government's intention to move in this place a piece of legislation, it does not of itself ensure orderly planning and sufficient time for proper consideration of that legislation. The government's practice has been to stack bills at the end of the session, which inhibits the capacity of the Senate to do its job properly. This motion, unfortunately, is not a step towards resolving that shortcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have, from time to time, moved various motions&mdash;referred to commonly as cut-off motions&mdash;which have required the government to have matters debated in this chamber in an orderly way during the course of a sitting of the parliament. Those motions have been vigorously opposed by the government. In fact, the most effective motion that we moved and had passed in that regard brought down the wrath of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) upon the House of Representatives. In effect, he closed out most of the opposition's democratic rights to hold a government answerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He unilaterally decided that there would be no right of the opposition to move censure motions or to bring on matters of public importance. He undermined the capacity of an opposition to meet its constitutional responsibility. That is the attitude of this Prime Minister when the parliament seeks to resist his somewhat unique method of government. He fails to recognise that government in this country includes the parliament as an essential part of the process&mdash;and the parliament has a right and responsibility to debate legislation and to have adequate time to do it properly. He might regard us as unrepresentative swill and a nuisance in his legislative program, but we have a responsibility to the Australian people and we will not be bullied by him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet he used his numbers in the House of Representatives to take out his wrath on the capacity of that chamber to fulfil its constitutional responsibility. That was a dark day in Australian democracy and the people ought to hold the Prime Minister accountable for that. I simply say in passing that whilst we support provisions that give this chamber more notice of the government's program, it does not resolve the fundamental problem that the government still will not meet an obligation to have orderly planning and will not bring bills before this chamber in a timetable that will allow proper and adequate consideration of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the time is appropriate we will try again to introduce and have carried cut-off motions that will enforce orderly programming. I presume the Prime Minister will act as he did on the last occasion, which was to the detriment of democracy in this country. But we are determined, one way or another, to ensure that this government is forced to orderly programming. It has a responsibility to manage the place. Sometimes we think it likes to pass that responsibility to us. It is its legislative program; it controls the business before the chamber. We have always said that we will meet that responsibility according to the government's program. It is about time it started to get that program in order. So I support this motion but I nevertheless say that it does not address the fundamental problem before us in relation to procedural matters. </PARA>

I am not going along with that. That is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to keep these people honest. This was an undertaking given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) as part of the accountability package. He said, `We the government will attempt to ensure that we will work on the principle of introducing legislation in one session of the Senate and debating it the next.' I was fully aware of what he was saying under those circumstances. Now you are allowing him to weasel out of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill, by his interjection to me, has obviously misunderstood what the government is talking about. He did not realise that this means 50 pieces of legislation can be dumped on the table in the House of Representatives, not be debated until the last sitting day in December, and then we will be expected to deal with them the next session. I am not having a bar of that. That would not allow us sufficient time to consult our constituents, the people that elect us. Why? Because everything in Australia tends to close down over Christmas. Now, with the new sitting patterns, we are sitting in February. We will not have the opportunity of properly canvassing these very important issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I invite honourable senators to look at the orders of the Senate on page 38 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA>That is the first paragraph of the motion. It is an order of the Senate. The government is now trying to dilute that particular order of the Senate, and in such a manner as would quite seriously place a question mark over the government's credibility and undertaking through its leader in this place, Senator Gareth Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does Senator Evans not come in here now? Why does he let Senator Faulkner carry the can? Why does he not come in here and defend what is being done here? He does not do it; he cannot deliver. He has not delivered on anything as far as I am concerned, and he is not delivering on this matter either. Senator Evans's credibility is under question in this particular matter.

<PARA>I do not want to unnecessarily take up the time of the Senate. However, in view of the nonsense argument put by the Senator Bolkus in an earlier debate today as to why we would seek to postpone debate of these matters for one week, let me put on the record that we are more than willing to debate the Racial Hatred Bill, except for the fact that the government knows that it is currently flawed. It is not a debate about the politics of the issue and whether the government legislation is the best way to address a particular problem in the community. It is simply a matter that has arisen out of the interpretation in the Brandy case which puts in some serious doubt the enforceability of parts of the Racial Hatred Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to us, in accordance with sensible process and normal Senate process, that such a flaw should be overcome before debate proceeds in this place. To do that in strict terms, we could have agreed with the Greens' motion earlier this day, but, because we are anxious that the Racial Hatred Bill debate be proceeded with, we do not want to go that far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We simply say to the government at this stage that it should meet its normal obligations in relation to the preceding bill, the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. The government is seeking today to overcome its problem of the flaw by debate on substantial amendments to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill, amendments which we only received at the end of last week. That has precluded us from the normal opportunity to consider those amendments at a shadow ministry level and in the party room process, and we seek to do that in accordance with normal process. That will allow sufficient time in this session to deal in an orderly way with the first bill, the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill, and then the Racial Hatred Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no suggestion that we are seeking to delay debate, other than to force the government again to get its house in order. The government can put to this chamber today no reason why the normal processes should be abandoned at this time or why it needs the bill to be debated today rather than next Tuesday.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make some remarks in support of the motion moved by Senator Hill. I understand in a sense what the Democrats are saying, except I think that they missed one fundamental point. It seems that the majority of people here agree that the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill should be postponed until the amendments that everybody received only last week can be properly dealt with. There seems to be sufficient majority agreement on that. The Democrats, Senator Harradine and the Greens agree with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question we now face is whether it is appropriate for us to, at the same time, defer the Racial Hatred Bill. Senator Spindler says, on behalf of the Democrats, `You don't need to defer that.' I am at a loss to understand why he said that, because an integral part of the government's bill that Senator Spindler wants debated is the civil remedies and the possibility of enforcing those. We have discovered&mdash;via the Brandy decision, and as Senator Harradine said in the committee hearings on this bill&mdash;that the government was quite confident it was going to win that case. Now we find a different situation: amendments have to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition senators who participated in the committee that Senator Harradine went along to&mdash;and those who did not participate&mdash;are very interested in this bill. They very much want to comment on the civil remedies and the enforcement procedures. They do not want to simply come in here and tack on a few remarks in the committee stage. They want to have the proper time to amend the speeches that they might have prepared&mdash;either on paper or in their heads&mdash;on the racial hatred legislation. They want to include in their speeches in the second reading debate comments vis-a-vis the enforcement procedures. We do not think it is reasonable that they be asked to do that without the enforcement procedures having gone through the proper processes. That, of course, brings us back to where we were this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus will undoubtedly say, `Look, all we are doing is returning this back to 1992.' I have already established this morning that that is not the case. Government advisers freely admit that. There are a few other changes. The government says they are minor changes but, as Senator Harradine pointed out, it also said that the Brandy case was not going to get up. So what confidence should we have in the view that the government puts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was mistakenly offered one of the adviser's briefing notes this morning and, doing the right thing as I generally try to do, gave it back, I could not help but see a page headed `Matters that might come up in debate'. I said, `Perhaps I could have a copy of that as well. I'd like to be informed when this matter is considered.' But I could not have a copy of that. Why not? Because the public servants are there as advisers to the executive, and they do not want to give me the things that might come up in the debate. They want to keep me as ill-informed as they possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think it is fair enough that the government clearly thinks the Racial Hatred Bill should follow the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. That is in its programming this morning. It is the sensible ordering of the two bills. The reason it is the sensible ordering of the two bills is that there are several provisions in the government's Racial Hatred Bill. The enforcement of those provisions was thrown out of the window by the High Court's Brandy decision. The government now says it has some amendments that will at least be a holding position to fix that problem. The government wanted us to deal with those today, without proper consideration and just by taking its word for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that those enforcement procedures need to be fixed, we think it is unreasonable for the government to ask us to deal with the Racial Hatred Bill before we have ascertained the propriety of those amendments to the enforcement procedures. It is important to postpone the human rights legislation in order to establish the propriety or otherwise of the enforcement procedures that are now going to be suggested so that we can check that everything is as the government advisers say it is. It is sensible to make sure of that before the government proceeds with the second reading speech on the Racial Hatred Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for that is that the second reading speech is not meant to be bits and pieces of information pulled out of the air that will do today because it suits the government to deal with this bill today or because the Democrats do not care whether it is dealt with today. The second reading speech is meant to refer to the problems that the government thinks are in the bill. The basic principles behind the bill can be included, but the second reading speech is designed to give the government the opportunity to outline what it thinks are the problems. Until the enforcement procedures are settled, how can someone refer to that in their speech in the second reading debate? They simply cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be plenty of bills where we could split the second reading debate and the committee stage&mdash;bills where a matter is looked at by a committee and then comes back, there having been adequate time to consider the committee's report, and we proceed. But an integral part of the Racial Hatred Bill is the civil remedies, and an integral part of those civil remedies is the enforcement procedures. Surely it is appropriate to get those settled before we ask people to debate the second reading of the Racial Hatred Bill. For that reason, I urge the Democrats to reconsider their position and to recognise the need for people to make sensible comment in their contributions to the second reading debate that refers to both the criminal and the civil remedies and the enforcement procedures for both. I urge them to do the sensible thing and at least get the enforcement procedures settled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are prepared to meet the government halfway. We had the opportunity to support the Greens and refuse to debate any of this until the human rights legislation amendments had been completely dealt with by both houses. We thought that was an unreasonable request because, for one reason or another, there might be a scheduling problem, but all parties might be in agreement&mdash;I emphasise `might be in agreement'&mdash;that the amendments the government seeks to move are nothing more than what it says they are. There may be no problem with them. Had we supported the Greens' motion this morning, simply because of some minor scheduling problem we could be held up from debating the Racial Hatred Bill. We do not want to be in that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we want is the proper time to consider the amendments to the human rights legislation and to assess the position we will then be in when we are looking at the enforcement procedures in the Racial Hatred Bill. Once that is settled, after we have all had the proper time to consider this&mdash;for us that will be Tuesday of next week because that is when we will have taken those amendments to our shadow ministry and to our party room and probably got independent advice; we will probably seek that because, as the government admits, it is also making what it describes as some minor technical changes&mdash;and it has gone through our proper processes and Senator Harradine, Senator Chamarette, Senator Margetts and the Democrats have had the time to consider it, then we think it will be fair enough to start the Racial Hatred Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if the human rights amendments are not technically passed by both houses, by then everyone will be in a position to know where they are going to go and they will know what they want to say in their contributions to the second reading debate of the Racial Hatred Bill and with respect to the enforcement procedures in the civil remedies, which are an integral part of that bill. For that reason, we think it is very sensible on this occasion to keep the second reading debate and the committee stage together rather than separate them in some way for whatever reason. </PARA>

They are not prepared to have the second reading debate. There are many speakers on the second reading debate list. We often have in this place second reading debate before final amendments are even produced to the parliament. We often have amendments coming from the opposition's side at the end of second reading debates. It is even more shameful that those opposite are not prepared to allow this process to continue with respect to this bill's second reading when they already have the amendments. That accentuates what they are on about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We often debate bills in this place. However, you are not prepared to confront this issue this week because there is an election in New South Wales and you do not want to be exposed on the issue of race and exposed to the ethnic communities. I can tell you something&mdash;you have been. That has been acknowledged both inside and outside the Liberal Party. There is a chorus of voices out there in the community saying precisely one thing, `The Liberals do not care about race and they do not care about our multicultural society.' This cynical manoeuvre this morning has reinforced that view. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, has come in wishing to make a new profile for himself.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite say that they have not had time to look at the issues. Let us look at the time they have had in respect of this bill. This bill was introduced late last year at the end of some three or four years of discussion, debate, parliamentary committee hearings and broad consultations with the community. For instance, we had the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, the ALRC report on multiculturalism and the law and the National Inquiry into Racist Violence. All these inquiries were conducted in 1991-92 as predecessors to this legislation which was introduced before the last election. The government followed it up last November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has had a very long gestation period. What has happened in the meantime? The only thing that I have seen happen in the meantime is a rise in the incidence of racial hatred. There was a demonstration of this in the streets outside the bureau conference in Adelaide a few weeks ago. This hatred hurt a lot of people in a very personal sense. We witnessed the igniting power of racial hatred when we saw scenes from the football in the United Kingdom a few weeks ago. Racial hatred was very much at the core of the violence there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite say that we have had the bill, but what about the amendments and the final outcome of the court case? That has been considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. It has taken the approach that any reasonable person who does not have something to hide or does not want to run away from this debate would take in relation to this matter. The position that that committee took is outlined on page 20 of its report and goes to the core of what this debate is about today. The other incidental amendments go to other aspects of the bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Racial Hatred Bill is relatively short; nevertheless, it is complex. It was interesting to hear the minister quote Mr Victor Rebikoff from FECCA, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, a man for whom I have a general high regard, who is a great advocate for the ethnic communities within this country and who has done a lot for the ethnic communities. However, when the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee was looking at the Racial Hatred Bill, even Mr Rebikoff made an unintentional error&mdash;nevertheless it was an error&mdash;as to how this legislation would apply. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show that the legal adviser to the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, Mr Ian Lacey, corrected Mr Rebikoff as to the impact and implementation of the government's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not wise for the minister to seek to rely on that sort of advice in condemning the opposition's version of the bill, which I might add is only a draft exposure at this stage. Unlike the government, we on this side of the chamber are willing to say that we will take into account community opinion; that we will consider the views of the ethnic communities as to the best way to deal with a problem which clearly offends all decent Australians. I would have thought discrimination on the basis of race is abhorrent to everybody within this chamber regardless of their party or political persuasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite inappropriate and very unstatesmanlike for the minister to try to score points on the basis of who looks after the ethnic communities better. The simple fact is, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would be well aware, having served in this chamber a lot longer than I have, that this question of racial hatred legislation has now been on the Labor Party agenda not for weeks, not for months, but literally for years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact it introduced a bill, as I understand it, before the last federal election. The bill lapsed because the government did not pursue it. It then introduced another piece of legislation, which is currently before us. So it is hardly appropriate for the minister to assert that the government has acted with all due haste when we are talking about years of delay on the government's side and we, on this side, have given a date&mdash;namely, 28 March, seven days time&mdash;for reconsideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why have we asked for that seven-day delay, Mr Acting Deputy President? The reason, as outlined by you from the chair just a few moments ago, was that, technically, there are no amendments to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill before the Senate. They have not hit the Table Office as yet, as I understand it. If that is the case, then the minister is asking us to consider this legislation before the proposed government amendments have been tabled and presented to backbenchers such as me who do not necessarily get the advantages that the shadow minister obtains by getting an advance copy of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I am to take my role seriously in an issue that I believe, in my short time here, I have shown a very real interest in, it is appropriate for me to at least have the proposed government amendments before me in relation to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. Those amendments will have a substantial impact on the way the Racial Hatred Bill will be implemented and provisions of it enforced. Before I consider the whole regime of the Racial Hatred Bill, I want to know exactly how provisions of it will be enforced and implemented. I would have thought seeking a seven-day delay of that so that especially we on this side of the chamber can satisfy ourselves as to those amendments is a reasonable, sound and proper stance for us to take if we are to take seriously our role as reviewers of legislation in this house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enforcement procedures clearly are an integral part of the legislation. Indeed, why have the legislation unless there is some enforcement aspect to it which will give some teeth to what the government is trying to achieve? That makes sense, but we on this side want to know what those teeth are and how they will be implemented. It would be quite improper for us to accept in a sealed envelope from the government certain amendments and to say that we will just accept them without having read them. It would be inappropriate and it would not be a proper way for us to conduct our business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the two people whom the minister plucked out of the air as possibly causing us embarrassment and whom he does not want on the public record during this debate are both members of the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives is not sitting this week, so they would not have the opportunity to make comment during the debate. This is a week in which only the Senate is sitting and, of course, the minister could not think of one senator he could mention to support his argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a serious matter. It has taken considerable time for the government to get itself together in relation to this legislation. This is the second attempt at the legislation. In fact, during the hearings of the legal and constitutional committee, I was convinced that, although the Brandy case was about to be considered, we ought to proceed anyway because the government was confident that it would win. Clearly that advice was incorrect, as Senator Harradine pointed out earlier. The score was 7-0 in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that history in relation to this legislation, it would be highly inappropriate for us on this side of the chamber to accept carte blanche the assurances of the minister and the same department that got it so wrong in relation to the Brandy decision. All we are asking for is another seven days to consider the enforcement aspects of this legislation. I do not think that is unreasonable. I think it is highly proper. For Senator Bolkus, the minister with the carriage of this matter, to seek to cast aspersions on the opposition as to its reasons and to come up with what I consider to be inappropriate political commentary on the opposition is not fair or appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we as a nation are to be unified we need to deal with these issues on a sensitive basis and not seek to divide the ethnic communities as unfortunately has occurred with this minister under his control of the immigration department. There are legion numbers of people within the ethnic communities who will tell us that if we go around and listen to what they have to say. It is highly inappropriate for the minister to grandstand in this place about the importance of this legislation on this particular day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance to Australia is not whether this legislation gets passed today or in a week's time&mdash;or whether it should have been passed a year ago. The importance is that we get it right, to ensure that those who have to live under the law have certainty and know what it is all about. That is the best way to achieve a good and cohesive society. Certainty under the law is one of the most important principles for a democratic society that is governed by the rule of law. We on this side of the chamber are simply asking that we be given due time&mdash;only seven days&mdash;to consider the legislation so that we can deal with it in a way that is appropriate, given the trust that is placed in us by the electors of our various states. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> seek to put the Greens' position on the record. It might clarify the way the discussion is going. Essentially, the Greens' position on the motion moved by the opposition is a mirror image of that on the motion presented by the Australian Democrats. We do not have any objection to entering into a consideration of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. We feel that it can certainly benefit from a seven-day delay, which has been requested by the opposition and by the Democrats. We would not seek to oppose that. It is always good to give maximum consideration to such matters&mdash;and we received the amendments so recently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do object to dealing with the Racial Hatred Bill prior to the consideration and resolution of the anomalies raised by the Brandy case in relation to the operation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Obviously we want to see that logical sequence followed and we would not agree with the amendment proposed by Senator Spindler that we defer only the first bill, the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill for seven days, but nevertheless go into the Racial Hatred Bill. It has been stated that we should just go ahead into consideration of the Racial Hatred Bill, even if it is only the second reading debate, because the constitutionality questions over the operation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission can be resolved later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is neither a satisfactory nor a logical position in our view. I do not think there would be any argument with the fact that the Brandy case threw a spanner in the works of the operation and enforcement mechanisms of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I will read from the government amendments outline on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. It is not yet an explanatory memorandum, but I think it will be the supplementary explanatory memorandum. The outline states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments respond to the consequences of the High Court's decision in Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Others on 23 February which held that the mechanism for the enforcement of determinations by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, (the Commission), under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 other than determinations made affecting respondents who are Commonwealth agencies was constitutionally invalid.</PARA>
<PARA>The government is taking seriously its response to that High Court decision. It has set up a committee to consider some long-term changes to the operation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. We have an interim series of amendments which reverts back to the November 1992 operation of the commission. Whether those amendments are accepted or not, whether the commission reverts back to the pre-November 1992 operation or not, materially affects the consideration that we will be giving to the Racial Hatred Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum of the Racial Hatred Bill states on page 2 that criminal sanctions are set out in clause 4 of the bill. It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By contrast, the civil prohibition in clause 6 of the Bill addresses acts done because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin, otherwise than in private, which are reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate people. Under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Racial Discrimination Act 1975</EMPHASIS> ("RDA"), there are already a number of other prohibitions the contravention of which may be investigated and conciliated by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission ("HREOC") under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986</EMPHASIS> ("HREOC Act"). The proposed prohibition on offensive behaviour based on racial hatred would be placed within the existing jurisdiction of the Commission to conciliation and/or determine complaints alleging breaches of the RDA.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is a very tenuous argument to say that only the enforcement of determinations will be affected and that therefore we can go ahead because it does not necessarily affect the capacity of the commission to conciliate or determine. I think it is a materially substantial matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operation of that commission, which is so crucial to half of the Racial Hatred Bill, has not been and will not be resolved until such time as the amendments being considered in relation to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill are resolved not only in this place but also in the House of Representatives, which as we know meets next week. For that reason, in my view there is an irrefutable logic that connects the two bills and says that we should deal with one before the other. If we defer the first bill for seven days, the Greens feel that it is utterly appropriate to defer the Racial Hatred Bill for an equivalent period. That was essentially the meaning underlying the motion I proposed this morning which was defeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is interesting that there may well be, as Senator Bolkus mentioned earlier, political motivations involved in this deferral. As Senator Vanstone said in the earlier debate, it may be that opposition members felt it totally appropriate to defer the human rights legislation amendments because they had not had sufficient notice but that they did not wish to be seen to be delaying the Racial Hatred Bill. That is why they did not agree with the kind of connection that I raised in the motion we put forward earlier. It may well be that they want to avoid the kinds of political insinuations that Senator Bolkus was so free with in his comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I thought that Senator Bolkus's criticisms of the opposition's timing was quite revealing. One often finds that motives ascribed in criticisms reveal more of the accuser than the person may realise. I had no idea until Senator Bolkus spoke that the New South Wales election at the end of this week is very important to the government's timing in relation to its consideration, even to the second reading, of the Racial Hatred Bill. If he can say that the opposition has a political motivation to delay it&mdash;I do not actually think that has been evidenced by the opposition, but it may be so&mdash;he has certainly put it on the record that the government is motivated to bring it on before the New South Wales election. I think that is quite ironic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My main point is not just to make a crack at Senator Bolkus but really to repeat the question: why are we having a racial hatred bill? What is the motivation of it? What is the impetus? Surely it has nothing to do with the New South Wales election because New South Wales has a perfectly adequate piece of racial vilification legislation in place already. Instead of seeing it as support for what has been rightly mentioned as today's International Day of the Elimination of Race Discrimination, it may be that there is going to be some politicking at a federal level that may be ascribed in some way to and have some part in what happens in the New South Wales election. I do not think that is a very good reason either for delaying this legislation or for making it urgent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point at issue is whether a racial hatred bill is this parliament's best possible response to the occurrence of racial discrimination and racial vilification within our community in Australia today&mdash;a situation nobody would want to tolerate. We would want to seek the most positive response to that issue, and whether this bill provides it or not is debatable and will be debated. Also, the degree to which the operation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is affected by the Brandy decision is of crucial importance to the way in which that is addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a fairly longwinded way&mdash;I apologise for taking up the time&mdash;of stating why the Greens will be supporting the opposition's motion. I was not here when it was put forward by the opposition, but we agree that the two bills need to be linked in a sequential manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start out by fully endorsing the comments made by Senator Chamarette. Indeed, one could question why the government is so anxious to have the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill dealt with prior to the New South Wales election. In fact, I would have thought the New South Wales election, or any mention of it, was entirely irrelevant to what we are debating here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating here the question of democratic process. That is, the government affords the minority parties and the opposition in this Senate with an opportunity to scrutinise a bill which is being introduced. That applies to every piece of proposed legislation, not just to the legislation before us. That opportunity simply has not been afforded to the minority parties and the opposition in this case. I say to those people who are listening, to the people of Australia, that no doubt you would expect that to be a fundamental democratic rule that would be practised in the national parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been proposed here today is an abrogation of that fundamental rule. What has been proposed, with very little notice and with no opportunity whatsoever to scrutinise this legislation, is that the opposition and the minority parties should simply rubber-stamp it, to fly by the seat of their pants, to venture with a blindfold, as it were, into the debate of this issue. That is entirely inappropriate, undemocratic and something that should be abhorrent to the people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill does have relevance to the Racial Hatred Bill. I was a member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee which looked into this matter. I appreciate that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) says that this matter has been ventilated a great deal and that it does in fact go back some years, but we have an intervening cause, an intervening event, which changed things dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was whilst the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee was conducting its inquiry that the High Court handed down its decision in the Brandy case, and that changed things radically. It changed things so much that the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee called before it the Attorney-General's Department to give evidence as to the effect this case would have on the Racial Hatred Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an unusual situation. It is not often that a Senate committee, during the course of its inquiry, has a decision by the highest court in this land which affects the subject of that inquiry, but that is precisely what happened.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> So all the years of inquiry, all the years of discussion might basically count for nought. That is what the committee had to inquire into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus is entirely wrong when he quotes the Senate committee as saying there is no problem with continuing the debate on the Racial Hatred Bill. In the dissenting report, which was signed by Senator McGauran, Senator Brownhill, Senator Short, Senator Abetz, Senator O'Chee, Senator Baume and me, it was stated that, given the recent decision of the High Court in the case of Harry Brandy v. the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, it would be necessary to await the government's response to ascertain the mechanisms whereby enforceability for a complaint can be achieved.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not the unanimous decision of that committee that we could proceed with this debate; the coalition's dissenting report said that we needed to wait and see what the Attorney-General's response to that case was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we questioned officers from that department, it became apparent that they were faced with a very complex question indeed and were looking at the interim period, going back to the pre-1992 situation, trying to fathom out a response. The Brandy decision basically says that these commissions, which are looking at human rights matters, equal opportunity matters and sexual discrimination, could not function as a court, that it was an abuse of that part of the constitution which requires a separation of powers; that is, you cannot confer judicial powers on non-judicial bodies. That was a fundamental flaw, so fundamental that all High Court judges saw it and, in an explicit judgment, cut down the operation of these commissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings us to the Racial Hatred Bill because the second half of that bill deals with civil remedies; that is, civil sanctions for people who might offend or insult any individual or section of the community by virtue of racial comments. So if we were to have the debate on the Racial Hatred Bill, we would get to a point where we would have to talk about the enforceability of those civil sanctions, those civil provisions in the bill, and it would be at that point that the debate would run into a brick wall. We would have the application of Brandy's case, saying there is no enforcement, no sanction. We could then only assume that the civil section is not worth the paper it is written on because you do not legislate against something and then not provide the sanction to back it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is saying that it is okay to proceed with the debate on the Racial Hatred Bill, to debate the niceties of a civil remedy for some act of racism. But we would be doing so in the light that its provisions are unenforceable. So why have it on the statute books? Why outlaw something if there is no sanction, if there is no force? It is an absolutely facile argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is saying, `Let us have a look at what the government is proposing here in its bill and make sure it does what the government says it does; if it returns the matter to the 1992 situation, so be it.' At least we can then conduct the debate on the civil sanctions contained in the Racial Hatred Bill on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment we would be debating in the dark. We would be arguing about a hypothetical situation because we are putting the cart before the horse. In fact, to maintain any form of logical democratic process, we should debate firstly the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill and then the Racial Hatred Bill. That is the sensible, democratic course of action and it is one which will not cause this country any prejudice. Greater prejudice will be caused if we are forced into debating a matter where we know not the answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I want to respond briefly to comments made by Senator Vanstone, Senator Ellison and Senator Chamarette. Much is made of the fact that we have not resolved the consequences of the so-called Brandy decision of the High Court. It would be useful to briefly traverse just what the substance of the situation is. In the pre-Brandy situation, it was possible for decisions or pronouncements by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to be registered with the Federal Court, thus ensuring enforceability. The High Court decided that was not appropriate. We have now amendments before us. For a minute I thought that Senator Abetz said he had not seen them, but I think that was clarified. We have certainly had them before us since Friday. We consider that inadequate timing but they were certainly available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those amendments substantially return us to the pre-1992 situation where separate action needs to be taken in the Federal Court to ensure enforceability. We rather regret that because it means that more cost is incurred by people seeking civil remedies before the human rights commission. No doubt in time some way around it will be found which is easier for people who take their case to the human rights commission. However, it seems to me that in this particular situation whether we have enforceability one way or the other does not really touch on the substance of the Racial Hatred Bill. I think it would only have some relevance if either the coalition parties or Senator Chamarette suggested they might be happy not to vote for the amendments ensuring post-Brandy enforceability by returning the situation to the 1992 position thus leaving us with no means of enforcement for civil remedies before the human rights commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that is not the case. I would find it extraordinary if that were the case. If that is not the case, surely the second reading debate on the substance of the Racial Hatred Bill can proceed on the assumption that we will have enforceability as suggested by the amendments of the government to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill that is before the Senate.

In fact, if there was any politicising of this very important matter, it was by Senator Bolkus. He should really think about that. If he is going to use the refugee situation and the question of racial hatred as a political football&mdash;as he and Senator McKiernan are doing&mdash;the chamber should discuss that. That matter weighs very heavily on my mind at the present time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said this morning, I am inclined to support the racial hatred legislation. I have found it rather fascinating that the government, over a period of time, has denigrated the concept of the educative role of the law. I have sat here for 20-odd years and listened to government senators and other senators denigrate the idea of the educative role of the law. That is what the Racial Hatred Bill is all about, to a large extent. To that extent, I support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously one cannot legislate to make people moral, but we ought to have a framework of legislation in which basic human rights principles are upheld. One of those human rights principles is that not only should you not treat people as objects for utilisation for some other purpose but also you should always affirm the person as a person. That is a matter that should be beyond politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have the minister, as Senator Chamarette pointed out, virtually admitting that the reason that the government wants to have this debate this week is the New South Wales election.

This is a matter which should be above party politics and the grubby politicking of politicians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been quite rightly said&mdash;I cannot remember who it was but one of the opposition speakers mentioned this&mdash;an essential element of the racial hatred legislation is the matter of civil remedies and enforcement procedures.

I ask the minister to find out from his advisers whether I was informed at all about the proposed amendments to the human rights and equal opportunities legislation. Was I? If I was, I did not get a copy of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to raise a matter of some significance relating to the financial capacity of the Australian Labor Party and in particular the New South Wales division of the Australian Labor Party, which is technically bankrupt. We know it is morally bankrupt; we know it is intellectually bankrupt; we know it is politically bankrupt. We see evidence of that every day in the newspapers. We see it all through the election campaign presently going on in New South Wales. But the fact that it is technically bankrupt financially says a lot about the sort of government we would get in New South Wales if the Labor Party were given the opportunity of getting back into the position of power that it had some years ago when it became renowned throughout Australia for the level of its corruption and its incompetence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party simply cannot be trusted with money. That is evident from the way that the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party has got itself not only into debt but also technically bankrupt. Its assets are massively outweighed by its liabilities. If that is the way the Labor Party runs its own party, how would it run New South Wales?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen examples in other states of how the Labor Party runs a state. Generally, the word `runs', in the Labor Party sense, means `runs down'. In Western Australia, WA Inc. ran down the state to a situation where significant people&mdash;even the former Premier&mdash;were indicted, put in gaol and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, we saw what Labor running a state meant. It meant the collapse of the state's bank. There were a whole series of financial disasters resulting in the state itself becoming the poor relation of the rest of Australia. Fortunately, Mr Kennett and his Liberal government, in association with the National Party, have been able to rescue Victoria. We have seen a similar disaster in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see how much of this financial incompetence&mdash;and, one must say, regrettably in some instances evident financial dishonesty&mdash;directly relates to New South Wales. At the moment the New South Wales Labor Party owns a building which is worth only a fraction of what it paid for it. As a result, the New South Wales Labor Party is hugely in debt&mdash;some $10 million&mdash;of which more than half is owed to the Commonwealth Bank, the people's bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can wonder why on earth the Commonwealth Bank became the lender of so much money to such an incompetent crew. One wonders how it is that this bankrupt organisation, the Labor Party in New South Wales, can be financing the biggest advertising campaign that has ever been seen in a state election in New South Wales. It is outspending the Liberal Party enormously. It appears to have a dominance of television commercials of something like seven to one on my quick count last night. Whatever it is, there is no dispute about the fact that the Labor Party is massively outspending the Liberal party and it appears to be able to spend something like $4 million on advertising alone apart from all its other costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal Labor Party president, Mr Jones, let it slip that the federal body of the Labor Party was thinking of intervening in New South Wales. I understand it has already put up about $1 million to help the state out, but there is the suggestion of intervention which Mr Jones has since resiled from by saying that when he said `intervention' he did not mean intervention; he meant intervention. To what extent this means taking over the state or simply trying to bail it out is a matter that will be found out on 31 March&mdash;conveniently just after the New South Wales state election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A whole series of questions is now emerging that, quite frankly, the Labor Party must answer if it is to have any credibility at all in New South Wales. At the moment all that happens whenever this matter is raised, as it has been by the media, particularly by Mr Alan Ramsey who wrote a very interesting article in Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, is that the Labor Party says, `That is just an organisational matter. The fact that we cannot run ourselves has nothing to do with our incompetence and inability to run New South Wales.' That is the Labor Party's response. Until it answers these questions, the Labor Party in New South Wales should not be trusted with pocket money, let alone the treasury of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have to ask&mdash;and I think we have a right to ask&mdash;is: what deals have been done to stop the Commonwealth Bank foreclosing on Labor over its debt in New South Wales? I do not know what has been done. All I do know is that the Commonwealth Bank has foreclosed on many people in New South Wales who seem to have a far better debt to asset relationship than the New South Wales Labor Party, but it has not foreclosed on the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question is: how will Labor keep financing its rising debt? How is it paying the $10,000 a week interest bill on its debt&mdash;over half a million dollars a year? Where is the  money coming from? If the Labor Party will not tell you where the money is coming from to pay the interest on its own debt, you can ask: where is the money coming from to pay for its political promises? It will not tell you that either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I submit the reason the Labor Party will not tell you where the money is coming from to pay its interest bill on its huge debt is, quite frankly, that it would be very embarrassed to reveal the sources of that money. Maybe we could look at some sources of funds that have been revealed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> recently to examine that. I will deal with that if I have time on another occasion. How is the Labor Party financing this huge $10,000 a week? It will not tell you because it would be far too politically embarrassing to reveal it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the money coming from to fund Labor's election campaign which includes, as I said earlier, something like $4 million in advertising expenditure? How can the Labor Party get that sort of money? Is the Commonwealth Bank funding its overdraft even though the Labor Party is technically bankrupt?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where on earth will this kind of expenditure, only part of which will be refunded by the state for electoral funding, come from? Will it come from the union movement? Let me remind the Senate that the union movement is owed about $2 million in New South Wales in back rent by the Labor Party. Is the union movement prepared to forgo what it is owed and put even more money into this bottomless pit in New South Wales? This incompetent bunch could not run a lolly shop. I say that because, according to the way in which New South Wales Labor governments have been run in the past, they have regarded government as a sort of lolly shop where you get your lollies while you can. This is what intrigues me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Labor Party has been able to avoid foreclosure because the Commonwealth Bank says, `Look, we'll wait till after the election,' what is it that would prompt the Commonwealth Bank to think that a New South Wales Labor government would somehow significantly change the financial capacity of the New South Wales Labor Party to pay off its huge interest bill and pay off its debt? Why would this magically happen? Why would an election win mean that all of a sudden the Commonwealth Bank's losing investment in Labor could be paid off?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that there is no honest reason whatsoever why Labor coming into power in New South Wales, if such a terrible thing were to happen, would mean that it would suddenly be able to pay off its huge debt and emerge from its technical bankruptcy. I presume that the Commonwealth Bank must take the view that it expects the Carr government to be like the previous Labor governments in New South Wales&mdash;back to the good old days of graft, corruption and lolly shop mentality. The ALP will be able to make enough out of being in government to pay off the debt. Otherwise, why is the Commonwealth Bank giving the Labor Party this special benefit that it does not seem to give so many other debtors?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can also ask quite reasonably whether or not the particular style of the classic New South Wales right wing, which would dominate any Labor government if people in New South Wales were unfortunate enough to end up with one next Saturday, has already been foreshadowed. I refer to the way a Labor government `will hand over the Sydney Showground to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation for a planned film studio complex without a formal tender'&mdash;that is, if it wins Saturday's election. The New South Wales Labor Party spokesman on finance, Mr Michael Egan, said at the weekend:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Labor Party did not believe it was proper or necessary to have a formal tender. A Labor Government would negotiate directly with News Corporation to ensure the film studio complex was built on the Showground site.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that other people are interested in that site, but the traditional way that the Labor Party in New South Wales does deals is with a mate, and one way or another some benefit to the Labor Party emerges out of that deal. Is this the sort of deal that the Commonwealth Bank has in mind when it thinks that it might be able to resolve the loss that is staring it in the face if the Labor Party is to win the next election? I am overjoyed to see the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> today, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasurer and Arts Minister, Mr Peter Collins, is right to reject the private threat from Fox Filmed Entertainment (a wholly owned subsidiary of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation) that it could move its planned film studio from Sydney to Melbourne if the State Government insists on retaining the tendering process.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Collins . . . while continuing to insist on the proper tendering process, has put his finger on the necessity for such a process to be observed:</PARA>
<PARA>He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secret deals were the very thing that brought Western Australia and Victoria to its knees under the administrations of Labor Governments.</PARA>
<PARA>Exactly the same sort of deal that bankrupted those states would be imposed on New South Wales if the bankrupt state ALP were to get its hands on the lolly jar. I can understand why the Commonwealth Bank is prepared to let the New South Wales Labor Party maintain its huge indebtedness until after the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders in that context what the Labor Party would do about the Sydney casino. What sort of secret deal would it come to in that situation? We have, in fact, a clear warning to the people of New South Wales. If they want to go back to the days of those secret deals&mdash;particularly secret deals, I might say, in this instance; both of those things I have mentioned could bear some relationship with media proprietors&mdash;and I do not believe they do, then clearly to get that they would vote Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the Labor Party's subsidiary company, Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd, has not yet lodged its annual return. The latest on record is for 1993. There is no annual return for 1994. It is in breach, yet again, of Australian Securities Commission requirements. It breaks the law. It does not pay its bills. It does secret deals. That is what the Labor Party in New South Wales is all about. That is the party that, frankly, has no credibility, particularly when it is outspending the Liberal and National coalition in New South Wales in this election campaign. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today is the International Day Against Race Discrimination. In view of the tirade we had from Senator Bolkus just before 12 o'clock in which he accused honourable senators on this side of being racists and all sorts of things, I thought it might be appropriate to examine the government's credibility on the issue of race discrimination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Race discrimination is not combated by what you say so much as how you behave yourself. I want to tell the Senate today how the Labor Party tells the ethnic community of this country one thing in relation to a commitment to do away with race discrimination but then quite happily tolerates behaviour by members of its parliamentary party which is quite contrary to the standard it would have the ethnic community believe it supports. In other words, the Labor Party is hypocritical when it comes to the issue of race discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence I wish to present to the Senate is contained in a radio interview conducted on 6PR on 10 March this year in which a Labor senator alleged that there was some dark, sinister conspiracy between the Liberal and National parties, the National Civic Council, the refugee associations and the legal profession to populate northern Australia with Asians. This ludicrous nonsense&mdash;it is quite simply ludicrous nonsense&mdash;is part of a long-running saga in which this senator has shown himself incapable of examining issues of migration with an open mind. I will read to the Senate portions of this interview that demonstrate the point that the Labor Party is quite happy to tolerate less than satisfactory behaviour from its own people. The senator in question, when speaking in relation to Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4), said to the interviewer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But behind all this Rob is the hidden agenda of that very secret of organisations the National Civic Council, who want to populate the northern end of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The interviewer, Mr Broadfield, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm sorry.</PARA>
<PARA>And the Labor senator continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No accident that the NCC have infiltrated and influenced a number of refugee support groups around Australia, so much so that there are some of those groups now who do not even talk about refugees any more, they only talk about asylum seekers.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Broadfield, quite puzzled, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now the National Civil Council, Bob Santamaria's mob, as most Australians would know it, you are saying what, he's in league with the Opposition now?</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor senator said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, no, no I'm saying that the NCC have infiltrated political parties, refugee support groups and others in our community. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Broadfield interrupted and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To what end?</PARA>
<PARA>This particular senator, so full of himself, continued to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . legal profession.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Broadfield said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, but to what end, for what purpose?</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor senator said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To populate the northern end of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Broadfield questioned him and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With Asians?</PARA>
<PARA>And the Labor senator said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he was going to say `with Asians' but he changed his mind and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With, to populate the northern end of Australia, to take the pressures off countries in the Asian region which they say are over-populated. Now it's not by accident that we've got the full-time secretary of the NCC in Western Australia, Mr Richard Egan, who is also the secretary of the WA representative of the Indo-China Refugee Association.</PARA>
<PARA>This must be the most disturbing manifestation of a psychological disorder that I could possibly imagine. If it is not a disturbing manifestation of a psychological disorder, then it is quite clearly the case that what we have is a Labor Party that is doing this sort of thing for deliberate political purposes. In other words, it is trying to whip up a little bit of anti-Asian sentiment in Western Australia for its own political purposes, yet it comes to this parliament and berates the coalition and says that the coalition is not fair dinkum about race relations in this country and that the coalition does not understand the issue of race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the issue of race and my colleague in the Liberal Party Senator Abetz understands the issue of race because we live with it every day. The sanctimonious piffle with which we are bombarded is quite simply offensive, but it is something with which we have to live. But when the sanctimonious piffle from the other side of the chamber is accompanied by this sort of crass paranoid delusion, it is quite clear that the Labor Party, in attempting to get the ethnic vote in this country by spreading dishonest statements about the coalition in relation to ethnic affairs, is totally and utterly hypocritical. No honourable senator could defend the behaviour which I have just outlined to the Senate. No honourable senator could come into this chamber and say that that sort of speech was anything other than a crude attempt, the very crudest of attempts, to whip up the old fear of the yellow peril. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it not interesting that there are a lot of people who have come to this country on boats? Not all of those people who have come to this country on boats have come here from South-East Asia. Is it not interesting that some of the people who have come to this country on boats as economic refugees now love to point the finger at another group of people who come to this country on boats, simply by virtue of their race?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What honourable senators on this side of the chamber say&mdash;I know Senator Abetz shares my views entirely in relation to refugees&mdash;is that this country has a right to determine who is entitled to be a refugee and otherwise. We have real concerns that this country should not be flooded with refugees, but we also accept that there are certain people who have such real and well-founded fears of persecution&mdash;the committee on which Senator Abetz and I sat heard evidence of that&mdash;that they should not be automatically precluded from a right to at least have their case heard as to whether they are refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, people who are faced with the threat of forced sterilisation, who are faced with the threat of forced abortion and who are faced with the threat that, if they are returned to the People's Republic of China and deliver a baby it will become a victim of infanticide, have a reasonable case for their claim to be heard and properly determined. That is all Senator Abetz and I say: they should have their case properly heard and determined. But, for some reason, the Labor Party is quite happy to allow this sort of bigoted opinion to be aired on the national airwaves. For what purpose? For what good? I do not know. I cannot see any good in any honourable senator whipping up the old yellow peril argument: when you get into trouble, say that we are going to be deluged with hundreds of thousands of Asians. It always makes good copy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I am one of the Asians in this country whose family has had an association with Australia that goes back to 1888. Our family has made over 100 years of contribution to this nation. The suggestion that somehow the Asians are here to rape and pillage this country is to me, and to the entire Asian community in this country of Australia, offensive, disgusting and is designed to lower the standing of the Asian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Asian community in this country is united in one thing. There are ethnic, religious and geographical differences, but the Asian community is united in a desire to see a better future for their children as Australians than they would have had had they grown up in another place. That means a real commitment, a deep down commitment, to the betterment of Australia and to an acceptance of their role as Australians first and foremost in order to achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sort of behaviour from the Labor senator in question demeans that commitment to Australia at a time when this Labor government is spending millions of dollars to encourage people to become Australian citizens. I think a fair few people in the Asian community in this country would say, `Why bother if this is what we are going to be subjected to, if we cannot be judged on our achievements but only on the colour of our skin?' That seems to be all that matters on the other side of the chamber. If this sort of behaviour is tolerated, I say that it is time for the Labor Party to act if it is to have any sense of honour and decency in this matter. It is time for the Labor Party to abandon the mere words and to act to stamp out this intolerance and this blight&mdash;not just on its party but on this parliament&mdash;that such views are allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to reveal here and now the name of the honourable senator on the other side who gave this radio interview. The name of the honourable senator is Senator McKiernan, who happens to be the chairman of the Joint Committee on Migration. These are his balanced, reasoned and rational views. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to speak on a matter of public interest. It is Seniors Week in both New South Wales and Victoria. The week of 19 March to 26 March is the week in which we in those two states celebrate with seniors, acknowledge their contribution to our community and make a commitment to the needs of seniors in our community. As I mentioned in the notice of motion this morning, there were 2,109,109 Australians aged 65 years and over as at June 1994. That represents 11.82 per cent of the population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to address this issue because, as we will see over the next 35 years, the number of people in that age group will increase to 2.52 million or to over 20 per cent of the population&mdash;that is, one in every five people in Australia will be over 65 years of age. Many issues are of great concern to seniors today. Many seniors are pioneers who are actually paving the way for those of us who are going to be in that age group in the 21st century. They are making a mark and making it easier for those of us who will follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues that concern them are age discrimination in the work force and compulsory retirement on the basis of age; retirement incomes and superannuation; the area of social security&mdash;you only have to listen to talkback radio, as I was doing over the weekend, and hear how long people have to hang on to the telephone when they are ringing up the Department of Social Security; health, health funding, health insurance, access to health and waiting lists; community care that enables real choice for older people when they need assistance to either have care in their own homes or live in residential care; those who care for older people, many of whom are old themselves and, in particular, older women; residential accommodation and its funding; and mental health such as the increase in the number of people with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this is a week and a time when we should celebrate and take the opportunity to acknowledge the contribution seniors have made to our great nation. Many of them fought in wars. Many of those gallant young men and young women who gave up their lives and their health to fight for the security of Australia and to fight for the freedoms that we enjoy in Australia and take so much for granted are in their twilight years&mdash;the older years of their lives. It is through them that we have this freedom which we so easily and often forget about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also acknowledge the contribution that they have made through their participation in the paid work force. Many of them are working now in their 60s, 70s and 80s. In fact, I met a man the other day who said to me that he had just retired from his butcher shop at 86 and that he was missing the contact with his customers. So many of them are working and contributing to our community at what many would have considered some years ago to be a very old age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are older people in the paid work force, but also they are doing unpaid work as carers of other older people, as carers of grandchildren&mdash;and many grandparents now take enormous responsibilities in caring at home for young children whose parents are out working&mdash;and as voluntary workers in the community. We see examples over and over again of older people playing their roles in hospitals and community organisations. They also undertake work in respect of interacting in their families. I was talking to a colleague only today&mdash;and I will not obviously discuss who it is&mdash;who told me what an important role the grandparent had played in a particular issue that faced their family in the last few weeks. Often we forget the role that they play in giving guidance and assistance and sometimes being a linchpin or a conduit between the younger person and their families when communication breaks down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We find that the government has done much to undermine the certainty and lifestyle of many seniors. In the area of superannuation we have seen continual changing of the goalposts, with complicated and constantly changing sets of rules. There is increasing uncertainty with the compulsory superannuation guarantee charge that there will be adequate superannuation for the majority of Australians. For women, the situation in regard to superannuation is even more grim. It is generally acknowledged that, because of the broken work patterns of women, lower incomes and the effect of taxes and charges on superannuation accounts, many women will be severely disadvantaged in their senior years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to a poem that Joyce Grenfell once used. I do not know whether I can remember it all, but it read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have joined the old time dance band.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trouble is that there are too many women over and no gentlemen to spare.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems a shame it is not the same, but still it has to be.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some ladies have to dance together, and one of them is me.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very poignant example of the fact that a significant proportion of people who make up the older population, those over 85, are women. The government has not addressed the issue of women and their particular needs with regard to superannuation retirement incomes. It is a sad reflection on this government that it really has not done enough to address that issue, particularly in respect of the many women born during the baby boom who will come into that age group and who will be faced with inadequate incomes to live out their older lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area in which the government has failed seniors is in regard to the income and assets tests for the assessment of pensions. Time and again in this chamber we have pointed out to the government the inequities associated with the treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares as income for the purpose of assessing the pension. We might have seen a decline in the number of letters coming into our offices from pensioners on this issue because of the state of the share market, but once those shares start to increase again we will start to see a fluctuation in income for pensioners that is totally intolerable. When the value of shares was going up, my colleagues and I received letter after letter from people with a small amount of money, $20,000 or $30,000, in shares pointing out the huge effect that this was having on the flow of their income from fortnight to fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has said that in government it will rescind that unfair legislation. The government was forced into an inquiry. Although the inquiry has been undertaken, we have yet to see a proper response or any action from the government. Pensioners are still waiting, and I still get letters asking what the government is going to do about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has failed older people in another area. We have had report after report&mdash;the Gregory report and a number of others&mdash;talking about the inadequacies in the funding for nursing homes and hostels. The government has failed to address that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been a failure by the government to address the needs of older people with dementia. Various groups are coming together and saying to the government, `It is intolerable. It is impossible now to run a dementia specific unit. If you run a dementia specific unit, you can do it more cheaply than you can in a nursing home but it is more costly than a hostel.' The government fails to acknowledge that and very few, if any, organisations are now venturing into the area of caring for people with dementia in residential care because it is not financially viable to do so. The government has failed to address that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor has the government addressed the need to have flexible respite care. It is not always appropriate for older people to have respite care in a nursing home or a hostel. Many carers find that it is not worth the effort to get the people for whom they are caring into respite care in a nursing home or hostel because after two or three weeks respite care they have to settle them back into their own environment. It is more than it is worth having the two or three weeks off. Yet we do not see the government addressing creative programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give you an example. Aged Cottage Homes Inc. in South Australia runs a program which was triggered off and seeded by a donation of something like, I think, $250,000. This organisation has 600 volunteers providing respite care. That respite care is designed to meet the needs of the individual. We should not try to squeeze the individual into the program. What should happen is that the program is designed to meet the needs of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a person who has dementia used to like to go fishing at Victor Harbour, then what that organisation might do is find a volunteer or a couple who would take the person away to fish at Victor Harbour&mdash;back to where he used to go when he was younger. Some of the earlier memories of many people who have dementia are much clearer and they are not as confused if they go to somewhere they know. People do not see that they have failed by having to say, `My husband or my wife is in residential care while I go on holidays.' They can say, `I have never liked fishing. My husband has gone fishing,' so they do not perceive themselves as having failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The carers may take the couple away together. What they do is tailor the respite care to meet the needs of the individual. They are the sorts of programs that we ought to be seeing assisted and funded by the government programs. The programs should be flexible and meet the needs of individuals, not programs into which individuals are squeezed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have had report after report on the HACC program and the need for review. Some of the COAG meetings and the meetings of relevant ministers have pointed out the need to actually reduce the overlap. I think Mrs Tehan, the Victorian Minister for Health Services, told me that there are 39 various programs in the home and community care program. Because of the lack of case management, an overriding organisation and good cooperation between the state and federal governments, we find that people are falling between two stools. What we need to ensure is that the service is not there for the bureaucrats, for the service providers and for the state or federal governments, but that it is there for the individuals who need the care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, one of the things that older people face is age discrimination. We have compulsory retirement. The government has done nothing. Mr Connolly and I have introduced private members' bills into the parliament to eliminate age discrimination in the Commonwealth Public Service. Nothing has been done about it. Why should we fix the retirement age at a particular age? It makes no sense and makes no allowance for individual differences in fitness or capacity in older people. The government has been very tardy in addressing this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing the government has been tardy in addressing is the issue of age discrimination. We constantly hear how it is hot shot on women's issues, but where is it when it comes to age discrimination? When I was teaching at the Lincoln Institute I remember seeing an advertisement for furniture which showed an older lady sitting in a four-sided structure drinking a cup of tea. The bottom of the ad said, `Make a playpen for your grandma out of this modular furniture.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you go through advertising material, you can often find such age discrimination. Fortunately, it is being reduced. My students wrote quite a heated letter to the people who put in that advertisement. You can still see discrimination in the media in particular, and also in government policy, where older people are portrayed as being dependent, frail, inflexible, passive, unproductive, mentally deteriorating or even needing institutionalisation. Now that is not&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commence my comments by simply congratulating Senator Patterson on her very genuine approach to the topic that she just spoke about. In this matters of public interest debate I want to give recognition to the fact that today is the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. This international day was agreed to in 1966 pursuant to resolution No. 2142 of the 21st session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Australia voted for that resolution. It is noteworthy that at that time it was a Liberal-National government which controlled our vote at the United Nations for the purposes of designating today as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at placitum (xxvi) of section 51 of our constitution, we note that in 1967 an amendment was made deleting the words `other than the aboriginal race in any State'. In other words, the Aboriginal people were incorporated into the Commonwealth constitution&mdash;once again another initiative of the Liberal side of politics. That referendum won the overwhelming support of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the earlier debate in the Senate today, it is with a note of sadness that I feel it necessary to get up and talk on the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. In the past there has been what I consider to be a fairly bipartisan approach, as was taken with this amendment to our constitution to give Aboriginal people the same status as those of us who have a different coloured pigment in our skins or lack pigment in our skins. It is important to note that the Liberal Party has a very strong and proud tradition in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were submitted to some revisionist history earlier today by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), who suggested that it was a former Labor minister who had, in effect, got rid of the White Australia policy. It is worthy to note that the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was a great supporter of a former premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang. The current Prime Minister moved within the New South Wales division of the Labor Party to allow Jack Lang's membership to be reinstated. Indeed, the Prime Minister comments about the fact that he sat at the feet of Jack Lang and that Jack Lang had a great impact on his life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at Jack Lang's policies. They were unashamedly supportive of the then White Australia policy. Also, Mr Lang was, on any interpretation of the events, anti-semitic. He was concerned about the role that the Jewish community allegedly played in the black market. He sought to paint all Jews with a particular brush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today Senator O'Chee has highlighted another example of the departure from what I would have hoped would have been a bipartisan approach to these important issues of tolerance and elimination of racial discrimination. It saddens me greatly that the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration should say in a media release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia could become flooded with hundreds of thousands of boat people from China and . . . other Asian countries.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in relation to a bill that was once before us, but is now no longer before us. It has been withdrawn and, undoubtedly, will surface again here later on in a slightly different form. That legislation seeks to talk about the fertility control policies of countries. Another subclause says that, for the purposes of this legislation, the fertility control policy of China is considered to be one such example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did Senator McKiernan find it necessary to talk about hundreds of thousands of boat people from China and some other Asian countries? The legislation, as I understood it, was not designed to victimise Chinese and Asians; it was designed, allegedly, to be a response to a perceived problem as to what might happen with fertility control policies being used for certain purposes. Why the need to refer to Chinese and Asians? Why could he not have just said, `This is designed to stop people from using the fertility control policies in their countries'? But no, he had to pick on Chinese and other Asians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One really has to look behind the mentality that would allow a senator to make those sorts of comments. Clearly, lying behind that is a thought process which is not necessarily in tune with a concept of elimination of racial discrimination. I found that comment by Senator McKiernan, the chairman of the committee, particularly unfortunate and unhelpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs sought to impute improper motives to the opposition when we sought earlier today to delay&mdash;for only some seven days&mdash;the discussion of a bill so that we could consider it. He sought to claim that the Labor Party was the champion of abolishing racial discrimination. Given the few examples that I have just mentioned&mdash;the Prime Minister's wholesale embrace of Jack Lang with his outrageous racial policies and the Labor Party's current embrace of Senator Jim McKiernan as chairman of that important committee&mdash;I would have thought the Labor Party would be the last party to stand up and give a patronising lecture to people on the opposition side about their attitude to ethnic groups within this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee is an Australian by birth, but he has certain physical characteristics that clearly indicate he has a heritage other than Anglo-Saxon. The National Party found no hindrance in endorsing him for a safe Senate seat&mdash;indeed, a casual vacancy; a guaranteed introduction to the Senate. I was not born in Australia. By looking at me you would not necessarily be able to tell that I was not born in Australia, because I do not have the distinguishing features that Senator O'Chee does, but the `z' in my surname gives it away. Most people would say, `Well, that is a foreign name. Where's it from? What's your heritage?' A lot of people ask me that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party in my state found no difficulty in endorsing me&mdash;once again, for a casual vacancy&mdash;for straight entrance into the Senate to represent the people of Tasmania and to be a representative of the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party has had a very proud tradition of supporting the ethnic communities, working with them, endorsing them and having them sit in this chamber and in other houses all around this country. It really does ill-behove the minister and the Australian Labor Party to try to score points off the opposition by saying that somehow they are better managers of the ethnic groups within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I used an analogy once and I will repeat it here. Whilst there is a lot of talk within the community about Australia being a multicultural nation, my view is that we are drawn from a lot of different backgrounds, but it is like a good curry&mdash;that is, there are a whole lot of different herbs and spices mixed into one, but you do not give preference to one particular herb or spice. It is described as a curry and it is the full flavour of all the different components that gives the food a distinct flavour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in Australia today that Australian culture has a distinct flavour because of the Chinese contribution, the German contribution, the Dutch contribution, the Asian contribution and, above all, the English contribution which has had such a very significant impact on our country and on the formation of this parliament and the way our legal system operates. I believe that all the ethnic communities working together can achieve a result which will make Australia a standard bearer in the rest of the world in our approach to the intermingling of the different races. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is sad that on this the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination we had to suffer the sort of commentary we heard from the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I would have thought that if there was one thing a minister for immigration ought to be seeking to do, it would be to bring about harmony within the portfolio of immigration between the different ethnic communities and, above all, to get a bipartisan approach to the question of any legislation that is required to deal with migration and matters such as racial hatred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no-one on this side of the house who would in any way condone racial discrimination or racial hatred. The rally in Melbourne that we saw on our TVs over the weekend is an event that deeply disturbs every decent thinking Australian&mdash;to think that people would hold those views. However, we on this side of the house take the view that no matter how obnoxious those views are, people ought to be allowed, in general terms, to express them. Nevertheless, we will work without ceasing to ensure that there is, within the community of Australia, an acceptance of all the different racial groups as full Australians and as a part of mainstream Australia without trying to marginalise them by treating them the way the minister has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today is the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and I believe that Australia has already come a long way in achieving that as a result of the golden age of Australian politics, which was the Liberal era under Robert Menzies, John Gorton, Harold Holt and Billy McMahon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. What are the implications of the High Court decision last week for the future of the native title legislation? What is the government's reaction to the statement by the Western Australian Premier that he will continue to fight against that legislation? Will the government accept the opposition leader's proposal to make the legislation more workable?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1774" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The High Court decision on Mabo and the Native Title Act is a complete and absolute vindication of the stance the Commonwealth government has taken on the constitutionality of our legislation as well as on the principles of justice which underlie that legislation. It is now open to the Western Australian government to come on board and cooperate as other states and territories are doing in putting together a sensible and equitable regime for providing justice for the first time to Aboriginal Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is certainly concerned about the uncertainty relating to the new titles issued in Western Australia since 1993. Premier Court has deliberately ignored the processes that were set down in the Native Title Act. He has to take ultimate responsibility for the effect of his decision in Western Australia. He has to take responsibility for the waste of at least $4 million of taxpayers' money and for the uncertainty that now surrounds some thousands of titles that have been issued since 1993. The uncertainty, such as it is in Western Australia, is wholly of that state government's doing&mdash;and it is up to it to decide how best to fix the mess it has created. We are nevertheless prepared to work with the Western Australian government to ensure that issues arising from this decision can be addressed cooperatively. Preliminary talks have already been held at ministerial level with the Court government and further discussion at both official and ministerial level will obviously be needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howard tells us that the act needs to be made more workable. He has not given us any information about the respects in which it needs to be made more workable except to say that he will respond appropriately to the responsibilities and interests of the states in this respect. There was not a word about the interests of those whom the legislation is designed to assist. There was not a word about anything other than state interests. That is typical. We do not know what in detail the prescription is going to be because there was not a word said about this in the otherwise extremely lengthy statement on a whole variety of policy issues that was made by Mr Howard to the Liberal state conference over the weekend. This is not an issue on which he feels comfortable. The reason for that is perfectly obvious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no doubt that the Native Title Act is perfectly workable in its present form.

I refer to the sudden, sharp fall in the value of the Australian dollar against the United States dollar and the trade weighted index, which includes most other currencies, including the Japanese yen, against which we have now reached a record low. Has the US merchant bank Goldman Sachs compared the Australian economy with the Mexican economy and predicted a further large fall in the value of the dollar because of the blow-out of the current account deficit expected in the next six months and the government's inability to deliver on its responsible fiscal policy? Does the plummeting value in the dollar and a continuing concern about its prospects greatly increase the likelihood of further interest rate hikes and tax increases once the New South Wales election is out of the way, or will you categorically rule out these increases in interest rates and taxes? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

I am prepared to concede that the current account deficit at the moment is higher than any of us find comfortable. However, what I am also saying and what this government has been saying since day one is that the government is committed to a significant tightening of fiscal policy in the May budget in order to boost national saving and, as a result, reduce Australia's call on overseas capital.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth in the Australian economy is perfectly sustainable when you take into account the enormously strong productivity performance that this economy has accumulated. It is sustainable when you take into account the extraordinary low rates of inflation that we have managed to hang on to for three years in a row, with inflation headline rates now running at around 2 1/2 per cent.

That is a function of the Reserve Bank's decision making authority, in consultation with the government, but in its own authority and based on its own sense of monetary responsibility. To make the accusation of the kind that you continue to make and have been making over the last few days and weeks is to demonstrate an absolute contemptuous lack of respect for the credibility of those people who make up the Reserve Bank board. The point is that we have a responsible monetary policy. We are determined to put the primary weight of the necessary economic adjustments on fiscal policy for the reasons that I have explained, and we have a sustainable deficit target that will be reached as a result of that budgetary process.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position follows what has been a very protracted period of discussion between the Australian government and industry and our Saudi counterparts. Over the last few months our ambassador in Saudi has had a series of meetings with the Acting Minister for Agriculture and Water, the deputy minister and other key officials regarding the Saudi requirement for the importation of Australian live sheep. A clear understanding now exists of those requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian industry is confident that it will be able to supply live sheep in full compliance with the tight conditions that have been established.

The conditions include strict age requirements, direct shipment to Saudi and the presence of a certified veterinary officer with each shipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to reopen this trade is a further economic boost to the rural sector, which is of course still struggling with the severe impacts of the drought. The Middle East meat and livestock trade was valued at about $300 million last year, and this included, importantly, $140 million worth of chilled and frozen sheep meat products. The access to the premium Saudi live sheep market will potentially add another $20 million to the Middle East trade per year.</PARA>

The administrative procedures are subsidiary instruments and can give effect only to the object of the principal act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not proposing any amendments to the act itself. This act is one of the centrepieces of the Commonwealth's environment protection legislation. There is no way that I would put forward any proposal that would undermine the act in any way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here, I am responding to the uncertainty that was created by the Gunns decision about the application of the act to ongoing operational decisions. For example, one of the potential consequences is that each individual coal shipment from a coal mine that has been assessed under the act needs to be designated and reassessed. I think nearly everyone would accept that that is undesirable, that it is unworkable and that it is not consistent with the government's understanding and interpretation of the act. It is also contrary to plain, good old-fashioned commonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, since the Gunns decision the government has overcome these potential operational difficulties through issuing short-term individual exemptions for decisions relating to export approvals.

It was, of course, in that context that he was visiting Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major-General Panjaitan was the commander of the ninth military district in 1991 and did have overall responsibility for East Timor.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that he was held responsible in the sense that he had to assume the commander's responsibility for the acts of those subordinate to him, which responsibility he did accept. He stood down and was forced to resign from the position in the armed forces that he had previously held. But there is an important moral distinction between the nature of the behaviour and responsibility of someone who was personally involved, and was in that sense culpable, and someone who essentially is formally responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government certainly had that distinction in mind in deciding, after careful consideration, not to object to his presence in Australia. I hope that it will be seen in that context and not in any way as the government being prepared to acknowledge that somehow the events of Dili were less serious than was previously said, or that the culpability of those directly involved was any less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do make the point, finally, however, that it has always been the government's position that a distinction is to be drawn between the events in Dili and those, for example, in Tiananmen in Beijing in 1989. In the Chinese case we clearly and unequivocally had a deliberate act of state policy carried out at the direction and with the knowledge of those at the highest levels of government, as compared with the situation in Dili in 1991, which was clearly aberrant, albeit grossly aberrant, and outrageous behaviour by local military commanders.</PARA>

Can the minister inform the Senate of the  truth behind the New South Wales Premier's promise during his campaign launch to provide an extra 26,000 places under the national child care strategy?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like anyone involved in child care, I was astounded by the Premier's announcement that he would provide an extra 26,000 child care places. Mr Fahey knows full well that he has made a promise that he cannot keep. He simply cannot provide those extra child care places, and the reason comes from his own mouth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premier, Mr Fahey, said that the cost of these 26,000 places would be about $116 million in one year and the liability for the state would be about $58 million. What this means is that $60 million of that liability would be the Commonwealth's. So Premier Fahey is making a promise to the New South Wales people that is contingent on this Commonwealth finding $60 million recurrent each year for child care when he has not even signed the national child-care strategy for the last five years. It is pretty bold of the Premier to go around promising to spend Commonwealth money&mdash;$60 million of it recurrent each year&mdash;when he has not been prepared to sign the national child-care strategy for the last five years. It is very interesting indeed.</PARA>

<PARA>I heard somebody over there interject, `What's this got to do with the Commonwealth?' It has everything to do with it. Premier Fahey is not prepared to sign the Commonwealth-state child-care strategy. He has certainly not contacted me about doubling the number of child-care places from 13,000 to 26,000 in one week.

They have been duded of over 8,000 places over the last five years because the New South Wales government has refused to sign this strategy. Now, on the eve of an election, not only is the Premier promising the heavens but he is promising to spend $60 million of Commonwealth money recurrent each year. That is a promise he knows that he cannot make. He is just not serious about this issue. He has ratted on families in New South Wales, and he has certainly betrayed the women.</PARA>

This is not a government that responds irresponsibly to the needs of this country for responsible economic management. If the Reserve Bank, in consultation with the government, decides that it is not appropriate to raise interest rates at this time, that is the decision of the Reserve Bank and that is one that we will readily accept because of course we would prefer that the economy is managed without the need to go back to further interest rate rises.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am, of course, aware that the proposal to build an international film studio in Sydney&mdash;which was initiated not by the Fahey Liberal government, it did not have anything to do with starting the proposal, but by 20th Century Fox&mdash;is in some doubt and as a consequence there is a concern that millions of dollars of investment in the film industry and all that that entails in terms of creative opportunities, infrastructure opportunities and job opportunities for Australians might be lost to Sydney. Senators would be interested in the history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal was first announced by the Prime Minister in Creative Nation in October of last year. The Prime Minister said at the time that the Fox proposal would need to be discussed with the New South Wales state government&mdash;this gave us some cause for apprehension because we did not know whether it would ever go ahead; nothing goes ahead once the hand of the New South Wales government gets on it&mdash;which owns the proposed site, the Sydney showgrounds. Given the importance and significance of this proposal, the Prime Minister was quick to commit the Commonwealth government to assisting with site development preparation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to hear twice today Liberal senators from New South Wales contend that sleazy deals are involved in coming to an agreement of exactly the sort that Mr Kennett has proposed. I do not think that is a reasonable criticism of Mr Kennett or any of the other states that would love to have the opportunity to have this investment. But rather than grab this initiative which the Commonwealth made possible, the Fahey government decided not to negotiate with Fox but to invite competitive expressions of interest to implement an idea that somebody brought forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very difficult prospect for people who have been in opposition for a long time to understand. Obviously, the originators of the idea would not be encouraged to come to the state with ideas if all their ideas are going to be held up for tender and their competitors can come in and bid for their ideas. Obviously, Mr Kennett understands that this is not a proposal that would be attractive to anybody wishing to make a serious investment. He has come forward and sought to steal this project out from under the nose of New South Wales, putting at risk the possibility that Sydney and New South Wales might gain significant employment, investment and creative opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a question of this being a terrible Labor attack on the Liberals because Mr Kennett is an equally enthusiastic Liberal. He is putting forward this proposal and he wants to attract this proposal to Victoria. This is not inconsistent with the experience of every minister who has ever had to deal with a proposal that requires cooperative proposals from a state. From Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania you can get an interest, a response and some sort of initiative that leads to a venture proceeding, but if it gets into New South Wales nothing happens. Every time you get a proposal that requires a hand from the New South Wales government, the proposal stalls and stops dead.</PARA>

Is the minister aware that South Korea very sensibly levies fossil fuel sales and uses the money to subsidise the up-front capital cost of solar units? Finally, noting that the paltry $6 million provided in the 1993 budget has not resulted in a single domestic solar hot water installation in Australia, does the minister not think it is now time we followed South Korea's excellent example and provided real assistance to Australia's domestic and export solar industries rather than propping up foreign nuclear technology?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about my answer to you last week or whenever it was, Senator Coulter, is that you were suggesting that solar energy could be the answer in itself to North Korea's nuclear needs. The point of the matter was that in order to generate the kind of power that is going to be produced by the two 1,000 megawatt stations that will be supplied under this negotiation to save us all from having bombs dropped upon us, you will recall, Senator Coulter, and in order to pay for the energy equivalent of that in solar energy, you would have to spend something like $15 billion on solar heating appliances scattered around the landscape, and that is on the assumption that there is enough sunlight in North Korea to play upon these installations in order to generate the wattage that is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the point of my excursion, not to say that there is no market opportunity for solar heaters at all in that environment.

It was desperately necessary to get a negotiated solution to that security problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think in a first class feat of diplomatic endurance the United States did negotiate such an agreement with the North Koreans, the trade-off for which was that North Koreans would be assisted with their energy production needs in the future.

But we should not underestimate the significance of that. The percentage figures are small&mdash;rising from four per cent of domestic consumption in the base year period in 1995 up to eight per cent by the year 2000&mdash;but that means 380,000 tonnes of imported rice this year and 758,000 tonnes by the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>

The type of the rice, the japonica style, and its utilisation and quality were very well received. If the processes that are instituted to implement this commitment enable fair and open competition for that 380,000 tonnes this year, Australia will win a very big share of it.

Under the national HIV/AIDS strategy, the Commonwealth allocates funds to the states and territories on a matched dollar-for-dollar basis for HIV/AIDS activities. Funding is provided to the states under the MFP for education, prevention, treatment and care, training and evaluation activities conducted by state AIDS councils and other non-government groups as well as state developed and administered HIV/AIDS programs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today, the Temporary Chairman of Committees, Senator Colston, agreed to refer to me a ruling which he made concerning remarks made by Senator Bolkus about Senator Vanstone. Senator Bolkus said that Senator Vanstone had produced `something out of a brown paper envelope'. Senator Vanstone submitted that this remark raised an implication that she had improperly taken some action in return for a consideration, and that the remark was therefore a personal reflection on her within the meaning of standing order 193. Senator Colston said that he was unsure that the remark was unparliamentary and that he was not convinced that there was a personal reflection intended, but he required the minister to withdraw the reference to Senator Vanstone.</PARA></TALK.START>

The chair has regard to the context in which remarks are made and, having regard to the context of the remarks in question, it would appear that the expression `brown paper envelope' implied secrecy and lack of consultation rather than receipt of improper considerations. If a senator believes, however, that remarks constitute a personal reflection, the chair leans towards requiring a withdrawal of the remarks; and that is what Senator Colston very properly did on this occasion.</PARA>

<PARA>During the recent overseas jaunt of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), he demeaned his position and that of the Australian nation by disgracefully breaking the long accepted convention of not pursuing domestic political issues whilst representing his country overseas. I am sure no-one will ever forget his elbowing aside of the Prime Minister of Singapore on the steps of the parliament house there to mount an attack on opposition leader John Howard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister was not so paranoically and embarrassingly engaged, which was the case most of the time, he made himself look even more ridiculous by telling the Europeans how to run their economies. He told Germany of all places, with the strongest economy in the world, how to do business with Asia, how to rebuild its cities and how to reshape the global power balance. While Mr Keating was feeding his ego by strutting the world stage, sounding every decibel more like a dictator in the making, the Australian economy continued to plunge into further balance of payments deficit, the foreign debt continued to soar and the Australian dollar plummeted against virtually all other currencies, including the deutschmark, the currency of the nation whose chancellor Mr Keating had the arrogance to lecture on economic management. Unbelievable!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, when I pointed out to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) that the fall in the Australian dollar and our chronic balance of payments problem made further interest rate and tax increases inevitable unless the government acted swiftly and surely to put its budget house in order, he refused even to comprehend that situation. The simple fact is that the government is attempting to sweep this inevitability under the carpet until after the New South Wales election next Saturday. That is a quite disgraceful abrogation of the government's responsibility to manage the affairs of state at the national level. It is almost an exact repeat of what the Hawke government did in 1988, when the Prime Minister was Treasurer and when the then New South Wales Labor government under Premier Barrie Unsworth was fighting for survival&mdash;unsuccessfully as it turned out. </PARA>

In reality, it was a recession we should never have had to have if there had been one ounce of economic responsibility and acceptance of that responsibility at the federal government level. We are seeing the same thing again this year in the 1995 election for the New South Wales government. I am absolutely certain that the result will be the same as that of 1988: that is, desperate attempts by a Labor government in Canberra to save their Labor mates&mdash;and I use the word advisedly&mdash;in New South Wales will be as unsuccessful in 1995, and deservedly so, as they were in 1988. </PARA>

On education, this government boasts about the number of children who are staying at school to year 12.

That in itself is not bad, but why are they treated differently from the rest of the Australian community?

<PARA>If Senator Crowley is not aware that after extensive negotiations the New South Wales government agreed to the expanded national child-care strategy on 3 February 1995, then she is not managing her department well. She knows very well that there was in principle agreement by the federal government and the state government to the terms in the strategy at an officer level.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley has long been critical of the New South Wales government for not signing the agreement. It seems strange, now that the state has finally forced the government to make concessions&mdash;only weeks before the state election, in which Labor is not looking good&mdash;that Senator Crowley is now holding off signing the agreement. One would almost be led to the conclusion that she is more concerned with playing political games with her state counterparts than actually being concerned about child-care places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales government had not previously signed the agreement, because it was not convinced that the strategy was in the best interests of children or their parents. It was particularly concerned that the Commonwealth's emphasis on child care for children with working families did not adequately address the needs of vulnerable children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales accepted the Commonwealth's offer of additional child care places after three points were conceded: firstly, when new places were promised for disadvantaged families, which Labor was not prepared to fund under the previous guidelines; secondly, when the Commonwealth finally ensured that administrative agreements were streamlined, which reduced bureaucratic delays; and thirdly, when long day care places were added into preschools, which is surely making the best use of resources. In negotiating for those concessions, the New South Wales government was not being obstreperous. It had simply taken great pains to work out an agreement that appropriately addressed the needs of families in New South Wales and ensured a high standard of care for children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern with affordability, flexibility and  accessibility is not something that the Commonwealth government has a very good track record on. I might just refresh the government's memory of a number of problems with the Commonwealth's child care program which were chronicled in reports which came out last year. These problems included insufficient baby places, insufficient child care places in rural areas, the cost of child care, a lack of flexibility in care arrangements and so on. Parents continually complained about the lack of places, the long waiting lists and the unsuitability of the opening hours for centre based care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course Senator Crowley is going to make these comments in the run-up to the New South Wales election.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard many apologies in various guises in this place, but this is the best one I have ever heard. The opposition is apologising for the fact that New South Wales took five years to sign the national child care agreement. That means that 8,000 places in New South Wales have been wanted by families but have not been available for five years, and somebody in the opposition stands up and has to apologise. No wonder people in New South Wales are concerned about the actions of the current Fahey government when that is the sort of thing that has been going on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Troeth talked about the problems of long waiting lists. There would not be such long waiting lists in New South Wales if the New South Wales government had signed the agreement when it was first discussed and put on the table. But it took New South Wales to the eve of an election which it looks like losing before it decided it had to do something for the families with children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that Senator Troeth would be well advised to go and talk to rural families in New South Wales about the preschool needs of children and why they cannot get preschools in those areas. She wants to talk about child care and preschool needs, but what about talking to the parents who cannot get their children distance education preschool because the New South Wales government will fund them for only about 70 places? Only 70 places in distance education preschool to cover the whole of New South Wales: you have to be joking!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales has crazy rules for people in places such as Wanaaring, where there might be only one child of preschool age. Because they live in a settled area, they are not able to have access to distance education preschool, which is the same as the school of the air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales government has been discriminating against families&mdash;particularly in rural areas&mdash;for a long time on the issue of child care and children's services. What about the issue of accommodation for the disabled in New South Wales? We would have liked a discussion on that issue, but it is not related to this answer. We are talking about child care and children's services in New South Wales. What the Fahey-Murray-Armstrong government has done is totally neglect and disregard the needs of rural families, particularly the child care needs of people in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That government should talk to the occasional care centre in Broken Hill. It has been trying to get extra funding out of the state government so that an occasional care centre can continue to run. The government should go up to Wee Waa and talk to the mothers and the families there. This year a mobile preschool is being run there because of a rural women's access program grant. But next year the state government will not provide them with anything. These are the sorts of things that people in New South Wales are having to put up with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, we heard nothing on this issue from the state government for in excess of four years. For four years this went on, and it did nothing. It deprived people access to about 8,000 places. I could not live with that on my conscience. Obviously Mr Fahey is suddenly having an attack of conscience now. We started hearing things from his government when we were about five weeks away from the election, and we have had a few headlines since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Why has it taken the New South Wales government four years? It has actually taken five years, because we are now in 1995. Why has it taken that government so long? It has come up with a number of feeble excuses about wanting to get a better deal and is saying that because it waited it has got a better deal. What about the families who have been discriminated against? What about those who have been unable to find the care for their children they have needed in the past four years? They have been totally ignored and totally neglected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of thing that a coalition government would do federally. We have seen it. We know what a federal coalition government would do because we have an example of what a state coalition government has done. This is the sort of thing that people will be opposing and voting against next Saturday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that we have not heard anything on this matter from the opposition. By today's performance in the chamber, it is obvious that an election is coming up in New South Wales. The opposition is very concerned about what the result will be. It is pretty clear there will be a change of government. When the current Liberal government in New South Wales has to suddenly, after five years, decide it will sign agreements it highlights to us just how very seriously concerned it is. I think it is an abysmal shame and a disgrace that it has taken a government five years to do something and it has deprived 8,000 families or more of access to child care which they desperately need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>This report, which is the second report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title, was tabled out of session due to the pressures of business during the last sitting week. This is a report on the first annual report of the National Native Title Tribunal. It is worth noting that this report of a parliamentary committee relating to Aboriginal affairs is again a unanimous report. The committee has representatives from all parties represented in the Senate except the Australian Democrats. I would like to thank the committee members and the staff, and also acknowledge the cooperation we received from the tribunal president and its staff. As always, they conducted themselves in a very professional manner. I think they are doing an excellent job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process undertaken to complete this report was very constructive. This point is highlighted by a submission from Mick Dodson, the Social Justice Commissioner. He made some very constructive criticisms about the operation of the tribunal, but he did it in a constructive and positive way and contributed to the debate rather than use it as a point scoring exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall conclusion contained in the report is that the Native Title Tribunal is soundly established. The early teething problems about which we received evidence seem to have been addressed satisfactorily and the tribunal is playing a very good role in liaising with all the interested parties. The president has established liaison committees in each of the states and is keeping in close contact with industry and the Aboriginal interests to make sure that the tribunal is kept abreast of developments and is sensitive to the needs of both industry and Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report deals with two major issues, but I will not go into them in any great detail. Firstly, it deals with the acceptance process for applications. Secondly, it deals with the president's first suggested amendments to the act. In terms of the acceptance test, there were arguments from industry that the threshold of the test was too low and that Aboriginals were being allowed to enjoy the benefits of the right to negotiate regime without fully establishing their claim to native title. Aboriginal groups were concerned about the delays in having their claims accepted, the pre-acceptance discussions the tribunal was having, particularly with state governments, and the allegation that they were being required to go through hoops that were not envisaged by the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee in its conclusion unanimously agreed that section 63 of the act, which governs the acceptance of applications, was being applied correctly by the tribunal&mdash;that is, that it was appropriately applying the tests set down in the legislation. In essence, the committee therefore rejects the view that the threshold had been set at too low a level. However, the committee noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the Tribunal to ensure that the pre acceptance consultation is confined to questions of a factual nature and does not amount to mediation or negotiation with parties.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a recognition by the committee of the concerns and criticisms raised by the Aboriginal parties with what, on occasions, they considered to be quite long delays at the acceptance stage. We are pleased to note that the president in his submission to the inquiry has responded to those concerns and is amending the tribunal's procedures to respond to the evidence presented to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other issue of the president's proposed amendment to the act, the committee took the view that it was too early, given the formative stage of the legislation and the need for more practical experience, to make a definitive judgment on this proposed amendment. The committee concluded at the time that we ought to await the decision of the High Court. As senators would be aware, that decision has now been handed down. The decision upheld the Commonwealth legislation and struck out the Western Australian legislation as being invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In normal circumstances it would be appropriate to consider that early amendment suggested by the president. I must say, however, that the debate has now very much moved on, not only because of the High Court decision in relation to the WA legislation but also more importantly, in my view, because of the decision of the High Court in the Brandy, case which has implications for the Native Title Tribunal. The changed public stance of organisations like the WA Chamber of Mines and Energy and the comments reported in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by the head of CRA in Australia are indicative that the whole debate has moved on. I think a discussion of the president's amendment is really not very helpful at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The president has submitted to the government a range of further amendments which address the Brandy decision and the implications of that decision for the Native Title Tribunal. The government will have to seriously look at those suggestions in responding to the difficulties posed by the Brandy decision. They ought to be the focus of discussion about amendments to the native title legislation. It is still the case that it is too early to look at whether or not the principles underlying the legislation have been successfully applied. That is due to the uncertainty brought about by the WA High Court challenge and the fact that most parties have held off proceeding under the Native Title Act until a clear decision had been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also issues relating to pastoral leases about which judicial decision is awaited. Quite frankly, the states have played a negative role in a number of cases by taking technical legal points during mediation proceedings which have not allowed the tribunal processes to run as smoothly as one would have hoped. All these factors, together with the basic fact that the development of common law in relation to native title will be a long process and will evolve over time, mean that, in my view, it is too early to properly assess and review the legislation and the impact the Native Title Act is having. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge now is to respond to the Brandy case decision to ensure that the tribunal processes and procedures are altered to reflect that decision, but to allow the basic principles of the act to stay in place. Hopefully, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title will play a constructive and positive role in examining the need for those changes and making recommendations to government and to the parliament. I would hope that all the acrimony that has surrounded Aboriginal issues in this parliament since I was elected to the Senate can be overcome. There have been some good signs during the work of this committee where, despite some differences of opinion, we have managed to produce two unanimous reports. Hopefully, when we get to more contentious issues, that trend will continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994 and by our support for the previous motion we were indicating that we are anxious to have this matter passed through the parliament as expeditiously as possible. We do so on the basis that, whilst we have taken a position of principle&mdash;and, indeed, I think to a significant extent we have been vindicated by the number of amendments that the Senate managed to achieve to the legislation which the government from the outset maintained did not require any amendments&mdash;I think we have demonstrated that the time spent in this chamber has been well worth while.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having reached the deadlock position as a result of intransigence on the part of the government in relation to at least some of the balance of those amendments, it seemed clear to us, as Mr Howard spelt out in the House of Representatives on 2 March, that no point would usefully be served by further delay because it was clear the government was not proposing to go down our path and we were not proposing to go down its path. In those circumstances, the only losers would be those who are intended to be the beneficiaries of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, we therefore have made plain that we will support the land fund. Once that is in place, we will obviously monitor progress through to the next election but at that time we will again seek to introduce those amendments which we achieved successfully in this chamber and which we think do go a very significant way towards improving the lot of those who are meant to benefit from the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that this time around, as opposed to the time when the Mabo legislation was debated, a significant number of Aboriginal communities and a number of organisations, particularly the New South Wales Land Council, have made it plain that they do not agree with the government's approach or with the position outlined by ATSIC spokespeople. That does not necessarily mean that those who were criticising ATSIC were right. It also does not mean that ATSIC was right. What it does mean is that there is room for intelligent disputation in the Aboriginal community, and so there ought to be in national politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great tragedy that whenever an issue relating to Aboriginal affairs surfaces&mdash;as we all know, it is a very emotive subject&mdash;the Prime Minister takes every opportunity to imply that only he is on the side of virtue and that his critics are hard-hearted, selfish people who are seeking to deny the improvement of the Aboriginal condition. That is clearly not the case. There are a number of ways in which progress can be achieved. I would hope that, in the spirit adverted to a moment ago by Senator Chris Evans, there can be honest differences of opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, I pay tribute to the work of two of my Senate colleagues, Senators Ian Campbell and Chris Ellison. After considerable consultation, it became clear that there was a significant demand amongst members of the Aboriginal community for much more direct involvement. They did not want to have things decided by so-called official representatives and they did not want to have land simply transferred to corporations. They wanted the approach to be broadened so that individuals would be of paramount importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators Campbell and Ellison travelled around the country during January, when Senator Ray and I were at the cricket. It was clearly a very important exercise in ascertaining what it was that the Aboriginal community wanted. I do not think we came up with any single view, and nor should we. But we did discover&mdash;I hope the government will acknowledge this&mdash;that there are very many different approaches that can be taken in good faith. Therefore, the amendments which were carried by the Senate but which the government will now not pursue are ones which we will certainly seek to reintroduce as soon as the opportunity arises, and that will certainly be after the next election. When we go down that path, we will find that the approach that we are proposing will have a much more holistic impact on the Aboriginal community. It will not simply be focused entirely on land, as important as it is. It will also address other fundamental factors which are necessary for human wellbeing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know the extent to which the Aboriginal community is greatly deprived in the areas of health, housing, education, welfare and employment opportunities. Unless and until we focus on those greater criteria, it is unlikely that we will see significant improvement in the Aboriginal condition. One of the great tragedies is that, after 12 years of government and the expenditure of hundreds of millions of additional dollars, it is very difficult to demonstrate that Aboriginal health has improved. Indeed, the statistics would indicate quite to the contrary. In those circumstances, the last thing that a Prime Minister ought to be doing is running around pretending that somehow a land fund designed to assist perhaps five per cent of the Aboriginal population is really going to solve any significant problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems on the ground relate to very basic human needs which need a lot more attention. They do not just need dollars. They need a lot more experimentation in terms of involvement by the Aboriginal communities themselves. There needs to be a lot more sensitivity on the part of those who are responsible for the administration of those funds. They need to fundamentally address the needs of the local communities. They should not simply be told that land is the answer or that without land they cannot make any progress. The argument has some validity undoubtedly but to suggest that, unless and until you are able to restore to the Aboriginal community an entitlement to land that is tantamount to the freehold that is held by many non-Aboriginal Australians, is almost verging on a cruel hoax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that you have to approach these things in a number of different ways and you have to ensure that you are making progress on a number of different fronts. So we will be, in due course, in the announcement of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy, ensuring that we address all of those issues and that, at the same time, we spell out our commitment to ensuring that the land fund operates in the best interest of Aboriginal communities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill. In doing so, I apologise for getting up to speak three times in about an hour in the Senate. It is not like me, and it should not give any credence to yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> stories or that this is somehow prompted by them. I am very much the 12th man type.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for at least a couple of government senators to speak to this bill. It is a fact that we occupied a large part of the debate when we debated the previous bill and I do not really wish to traverse all that ground. I acknowledge that Senator Alston did not do that, and that is appropriate, but it is important that we say a few things about this bill because it is important to put it in context. It is the second stage of the government's legislative response to Mabo. It is part of a package of measures the government has initiated to try to respond to the dispossession of Aboriginal people from their land. It is about their relationship with land and about trying to allow them to assert their independence and to assert their relationship with the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land fund will enable indigenous people to acquire land and to manage it in a sustainable way to promote economic, social and cultural benefits. It will address the needs of those who will not benefit from Mabo and the native title legislation&mdash;that is, those dispossessed of their land who cannot meet the criteria laid down in the Mabo decision, which requires a continuing connection with the land and waters. The High Court Mabo decision and the native title legislation will always be seen as the landmark, the symbolic recognition of Aboriginal preoccupancy of the land by Australian society. In a practical sense of making land with commercial viability and ongoing benefits available to Aboriginal people, the land fund and the measures contained in the social justice package may prove to be more significant in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resounding rejection of the Western Australian government's land legislation in response to the Mabo decision and the discriminatory way that legislation  operated has obviously reinforced the Mabo judgment and the correct approach that this parliament adopted. We can now seek to have those native title laws implemented and properly applied and I think we will make significant progress in the next year or so in developing native title. But it will be a long process. It will rely on judicial judgments and the evolution of common law. There are no easy solutions or quick fixes involved in that native title route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the rhetoric of some political leaders such as the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, the amount of land that will eventually be found to be native title land and granted to Aboriginals will be quite limited in its extent, because the tests applied by the Mabo judgment and reflected in the native title legislation are quite stringent. It will not be a boon to a large number of Aboriginals in terms of granting them land. Nevertheless, it is a highly significant and symbolic decision and it will result in real benefit to a whole range of Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice French, of the Native Title Tribunal, in his ruling on the Waanyi application recently, highlighted some of the problems that Aboriginal groups will have in establishing native title. Because of these problems, it is imperative that the land fund as proposed by the government be implemented and that we start to address the dispossession issue for those Aboriginal people who will not have any opportunity to prove native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These developments will also generally assist in reconciliation within the Australian community as people come to terms with recognising Aboriginal people as people with rights. By recognising Aboriginal dispossession, by acknowledging their right to the land and by purchasing land to be held by Aboriginal communities, Aboriginal people can help regain their self-respect and force non-Aboriginal people to deal with Aboriginals as people with rights. That is a very important development in Australian society. By recognising Aboriginal rights and by people having to deal with Aboriginal people as people who possess rights, a whole new understanding can be developed in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the risk of repeating remarks I made earlier today in a previous contribution, it is very heartening to hear the chief of CRA, one of Australia's largest mining companies, hailing the Mabo legislation as an opportunity for partnership between mining companies and Aboriginal people, expressing the view that he was satisfied with the central tenet of the Native Title Act and generally being quite positive about the role that mining companies can play in dealing with Aboriginal people as people with rights over land. That is a very encouraging development and represents real change in the climate in Australian society. I have also been heartened by some comments by the Western Australia Chamber of Mines recently, which indicate that it too is beginning to come to terms with native title as a fact in Australian common law, especially now that the Western Australian government's challenge to the native title legislation has been ruled out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been sensible in accepting some of the amendments that were passed in the Senate. A number of them improve the bill, and I am pleased that we have accepted a range of those amendments. It is now a very strong bill and one which will deliver to Aboriginal people in an appropriate way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to traverse the ground that the opposition has covered in this debate in the last year or so through the various positions adopted by Dr Hewson, Alexander Downer and John Howard. Needless to say, it has been a convoluted and quite confusing path that they have trodden to reach their current position. It is pleasing, nonetheless, to see that we will now get the legislation passed. The government's intention has always been to have the legislation passed rather than to have it provide a double dissolution trigger. I am very hopeful that we will soon pass this legislation and start to see the benefits of the legislation realised by Aboriginal people in the form of land that they can purchase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some brief comments about one set of amendments which really troubled me&mdash;amendments supported by the Liberal Party and the Greens in the discussion of the earlier bill. These amendments sought to have the ILC allow individuals and trusts to own property acquired through the land fund and allow grantees of land fund acquisitions to dispose of that land at any time without the consent of the ILC. I was particularly troubled by those amendments, and I am very glad that the government has held firm in opposing those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that, in developing their arguments in support of that proposition, the opposition parties and the Greens have seen it as a way of rejecting paternalism being applied to Aboriginal people and that somehow it will make Aboriginal people more self-reliant and recognise their  management of their own affairs. I am sure that has some appeal to those with an interest in rugged individualism, as the Liberal Party has always had, although I am not quite sure what the appeal to the Greens is&mdash;but I will have to ask them about that privately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My major concern there is that that clearly militates against the central aim of building up an indigenous land base and maintaining it for future generations. The government has continued to maintain its position&mdash;a position which the the parliament has previously always adopted&mdash;that holdings by indigenous corporations best reflect traditional forms of land ownership and provide more reliable guarantees of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot begin to imagine what would occur the first time an individual Aboriginal sold land granted under the land fund and used those funds for personal consumption purposes. I have listened to Senators Panizza and Crane over the years making repeated attacks on what they see as wasteful spending in ATSIC programs. They have continued to highlight what they say are real concerns about accountability and the expenditure of money in Aboriginal affairs. Senator Kernot referred to this problem in one of her earlier contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Liberal Party to seriously suggest that it would support granting land to individual Aboriginals, land which they could then on-sell and use the proceeds for personal consumption, and that the Liberals would not be the first to be screaming blue murder in this chamber, alleging misuse of funds and carrying on a treat, is unbelievable in my view. I cannot believe that the Liberal Party, given its previous positions, could seriously suggest that we should support amendments that go to that objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the government has accepted the general view of ATSIC and Aboriginal groups to whom I have spoken that we ought to maintain the grants to corporations rather than individuals and that we look to maintaining the land base and extending it over time for the benefit of all Aboriginals. I would like to acknowledge that the land fund will not be the last step or the last word in this process. The native title legislation represented the first step and the land fund represents the second. The third step is the social justice measures. Some of the ideas coming out of the debate regarding the social justice initiatives may be the most challenging and innovative in dealing with the problem of dispossession of Aboriginal people from their land and taking measures to help Aboriginal people regain their connection with traditional lands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of suggestions about making available other crown land, about regional land management agreements and about a range of other initiatives that involve a lot of lateral thinking. That lateral thinking has been possible only because of the way the native title legislation, the Mabo decision, and the land fund debate have pushed forward the debate about these issues and the recognition generally that land is very important to Aboriginal people. The cultural and spiritual relationship with the land that Aboriginal people enjoy is a much stronger one than that which Europeans have. It is a very special relationship that we have to recognise in responding to Aboriginal needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that the Liberal Party has quite come to terms with that. Contributions by Senator Hill earlier today and Senator Alston in this debate leave me in some doubt as to whether they have yet come to terms with that special relationship with the land and the need for the parliament to recognise that. We always come back to the debate about what this means for education, health and so on. I do not think the Liberals necessarily grasp the central nature of that Aboriginal connection with the land and the fact that, while those other issues are very important, the relationship of Aboriginal people with their land is, in itself, a very central and important issue. I welcome this second bill and hope the Senate supports it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is wonderful to have the opportunity finally to assist the passage of the Land Fund and Indigenous  Land  Corporation  (ATSIC Amendment) Bill in its amended form. On behalf of the Australian Democrats I signal again our support for the concept of this land fund and our vigorous resistance to some of the core amendments from the opposition and the Greens which, in our view, have the cumulative result of undermining the purpose of the land fund and, in so doing, eroding the land stock.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard Senator Alston's contribution and I am a little disappointed to hear the opposition mentioning what I regard as citizenship rights&mdash;rights to basic health standards, education and housing&mdash;and the way in which most Australians have access to those rights. The opposition is still tying those to the notion of land; still seeing land as some sort of commodity, which primarily is there to be bought and sold in a reasonably materialistic way. It is still seeking to measure, in the buying and selling of land, some tangible improvement in what I regard as citizenship rights of indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say to the coalition, given what Senator Alston said about seeking to move the opposition's amendments should the opposition form government, that I have not heard anything in the debate that would persuade me to change my view on those three core issues: attaching conditions to land acquisition and maintenance, making grants to individuals and seeking to give priority to the most disadvantaged. I signal to the opposition that, if it really means to put these amendments back before the Senate, should it win government, the Democrats would have to vote against them at that stage as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Native Title Bill and the land fund bill have benefited us by focusing public attention on wider issues associated with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in this country. It has been important to canvass views with respect to self-determination&mdash;the role of land, the spiritual attachment Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have to the land and the sea, and the place of customary law and cultural practice, particularly now with the Hindmarsh Bridge episode. We have talked widely about what constitutes consultation and dispossession. Those have been important discussions to have had in this place. Equally, it has been important to talk to Aboriginal people in this building and at various consultation points around the country&mdash;and for us to have gone to them in various ways as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Chris Evans: the land fund is phase 2. A great deal of consultation so far has gone into what should be in the social justice package. The issues that Senator Alston raises with respect to citizenship rights will be clearly addressed in the social justice package. I welcome the public comments we have seen so far from ATSIC and the council of reconciliation on what should be in the social justice package. Phase 3 of this government's response to indigenous issues in this country could well turn out to be, in practical terms, the most important element. I reiterate the Democrats support for this land corporation and land fund bill and look forward to some constructive debate on the social justice package. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the extensive hearings conducted by the Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill, a body of evidence was of the view that, should the coalition and the Greens not be able to get the amendments through, in any event there be a land fund of some sort. Mr Griffiths, who gave evidence at Dubbo, is the coordinator for the Red Chief Local Aboriginal Land Council in Gunnedah, New South Wales. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be totally honest with you, I agree with the concept that Lois O'Donoghue has put that we have to have something in place. I could not disagree with that. But, prior to that happening, I would hope that any house of parliament would have a look at the wording between the lines. If someone is saying that there has been full consultation with Aboriginal people then that is not right. It has not happened.</PARA>
<PARA>That really sums it up. Some 244 witnesses appeared before that committee, and there was an overwhelming view that there was insufficient consultation. For that, the government stands condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the coalition had a difficult decision to make. When it became apparent that the land fund bill might not succeed if we stuck it out with our amendments, the question was whether to pass a bill which provides a land fund of some sort or whether to oppose it and thereby thwart the process completely. Mr Griffiths believes that something has to be in place. He was in favour of the New South Wales Land Council amendments, which the coalition has adopted. Rather than lose out on the whole lot, he was saying that he would prefer a land fund in any event&mdash;if it has to be that way. That was the decision the coalition had to make. I believe that, in the end, it was an unavoidable decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the government had to make a decision as to what it did with the 67 amendments and the one request which were put forward in this chamber. The government decided to adopt 28 of those amendments. It would seem that the process of debate and inquiry by the committee concerned was of value. It was of value because the government accepted that there were amendments worth taking on board. I caution those who are somewhat overoptimistic about the working of this land fund. Having heard the evidence, I think it would still have been desirable to have had those amendments as proposed by the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a great body of opinion in favour of having the land vested in individuals, Aboriginal trusts and the like. It was regarded as patronising to have said to Aboriginal people, `You can only have it in the form of a corporation because we don't trust what you might do with the land.' It was put to the committee that in the wider community individuals were able to hold land and dispose of land, but in this case we had ties imposed upon the recipients, ties being that the Indigenous Land Corporation has some sort of control over the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Most importantly, I believe the question of regional strategies verses national strategies will prove to be one of the most troublesome aspects of this bill. I believe that in a year's time we will again be debating this bill. I believe that we will then have seen 12 months of activity which will show that we cannot place more emphasis on the national strategy than the regional strategy. I fully agree with those witnesses, numerous as they were, who said to our committee that we had to start from the grassroots and work our way up. I say as some sort of prophecy that we will be looking at this aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title, I look forward to monitoring the progress of this legislation to ensure that it does what the government says it is going to do, to ensure that it provides for the grassroots for whom this bill was intended, to ensure that vesting land in corporations only does not result in groups of Aboriginal people missing out, to ensure that the ILC remains accountable for its decisions and to ensure that it makes the most appropriate decisions where there is a conflict of interests. After all, there is a limited fund and there will be competing interests. We will have Aboriginal groups vying with each other for land grants and grants for land maintenance. It will be interesting to see how the Indigenous Land Corporation applies its decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I make those comments for the record because I believe this bill proceeded without sufficient consultation and that the select committee which travelled around this country demonstrated that quite vividly. I say to the government that, if it is going to tackle any further bill of this sort, if it is going to embark on any further social legislation, it must consult and consult widely. That was not the case with this bill or the Native Title Bill. The government seems hell-bent on achieving a political agenda; that is, getting this bill through before the next election so that it can go to the Australian people and say, `We did this, that and everything for those in need and for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.' The real question is whether the government did what it did effectively. Did it really provide an instrument whereby those who are dispossessed will be adequately recompensed? That has to be the question at the end of the day. It is not a question of whether the government consulted with some major entities or main role players in the Aboriginal industry, went away and then came up with a political solution. The question is whether it really addressed the needs of those who have been dispossessed over the course of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There has been some comment that this bill is for those who have lost their traditional ties with the land. That is so because the Native Title Act provided in the preamble that there should be a provision for those who could not claim native title. I say to the government that it would be totally unfair if there were a biased view that this land fund bill should be used only for the more remote areas of this country. This land fund is available for all Aboriginal people, including those who happen to live in suburbs in densely populated cities, not just for those who are living in the more remote areas. It seems to me that there is some misconception about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of our committee's travels to built-up areas, there were Aboriginal people living in such areas who had long since been dispossessed of any land but who are just as entitled to be considered under this legislation as any other member of their race. I will be monitoring that aspect very carefully to make sure there is an even-handed approach; that those in the city are catered for, those in the country are catered for and those in the remote areas are catered for. This is not just an instrument to be used for favourites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I support the bill. However, there is one flaw, and it is something that the government might take on board. As stated in annexure A and in the second reading speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), amendments 36 to 40 as proposed by the coalition and the Greens were to be adopted. There seems to be some problem because in the bill amendment 39 relates to clause 192D(3), which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister may grant the Indigenous Land Corporation Chairperson leave of absence, other than recreation leave, on such terms and conditions as to remuneration or otherwise as the Minister determines in writing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I recall&mdash;and I am referring to the list of amendments as contained in the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill&mdash;amendment 39 was in fact put forward by the Greens to omit the word `Minister' and substitute `Indigenous Land Corporation Board'. This bill was supposed to be a replica of the original bill and was supposed to have adopted word for word those amendments which have been set out in annexure A to the Prime Minister's second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am telling the Senate that there is a mistake because, when you read that amendment and its brief description, it states that the ILC board, rather than the minister, is to approve certain terms and conditions for ILC directors. The bill that I have been provided with via the chamber certainly has that flaw in section 192D(3). If the government does intend to adopt that amendment, it is going to have to change the wording. If it had intended this to act as a trigger for a double dissolution, it would have been in trouble because this does not incorporate the amendment word for word that was put by this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You could have used this bill only if it was an accurate replica of the original bill with those amendments that you chose to adopt, but you have chosen to adopt an amendment which has not been faithfully reproduced. It is not the amendment word for word; therefore, I submit, with respect, we would have been considering a different bill. So you could not say this could have provided you with a trigger. If you thought you were being smart, you were not. In fact, I would advise you strongly to have a look at that amendment, because you have adopted all the other amendments which replaced the word `Minister' with `ILC Board', and I see no reason why that should not be followed through in this case. That is just another piece of advice for the government in my submission today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This most important piece of legislation is part of a package, as indicated by the government. As Senator Kernot and Senator Chris Evans have said, it is phase 2 of a package of three. I ask the government to try to handle the next phase a lot better than it handled the previous two. It would help if it consulted with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community at large. It does not take that much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The select committee did a very good job over the two weeks that it consulted with the community at large and covered a good deal of ground.

The Native Title Act has demonstrated to a large degree a lack of efficacy. In fact, there is one view in the west that it is totally unworkable. My view tends to that view.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly on this new Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill to support my colleague Senator Ellison and to try to answer some of the smirks or points Senator Chris Evans made on the other side. This bill is for indigenous people who have been dispossessed of land in the last 207-odd years since European settlement in Australia. The bill enables the same people to purchase land, acquire land&mdash;whatever you like to call it&mdash;where they cannot make a claim under the Mabo legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amount of $45 million will be set aside in a perpetual fund for the Indigenous Land Corporation to make these purchases. The allocated $45 million is not a very big sum, but it is rather symbolic. I will certainly be waiting to see what will be done with it. That money is there for Aborigines to acquire land, to manage that land and to provide economic, environmental, social and cultural benefits. We have been told that in this case the Indigenous Land Corporation will be setting up a national strategy to carry out the tasks ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can go over each of the points I have made, firstly, acquiring land is quite easy if you have the necessary finance and, of course, if the land is available. Secondly, to manage that land is a bit harder. As one who has been on the land&mdash;managing land, acquiring land but not selling it very often in my time in business&mdash;I can tell you that managing land is slightly different from acquiring it, and Senator Chamarette is nodding in assent. You manage land to provide economic benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those corporations might have a few surprises coming. I do not know what type of land they have in mind, but I presume it is mostly pastoral land, the sort of land that Aborigines prefer to wander over and carry out their cultural activities. If anyone looks today at the pastoral industry in Australia and the difficulties it has been having, they might think twice as to whether it is such a good idea to buy these big pieces of land. Pastoral stations are especially quite cheap to buy, and there are quite a few willing sellers these days, but when you acquire land that is when the work starts, that is when the thinking starts and that is where the extra finance has to start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to say that there is a pastoral station on the market down the road in the Kimberleys, the Pilbara or the eastern goldfields of Western Australia. Excuse me for using the Western Australian regions, but they are the ones I know best. When buying a pastoral lease for $1 million&mdash;that is, one forty-fifth of the amount available&mdash;you have to look at ongoing costs and at paying the wages bill. I presume that if Aborigines are going to run a lease themselves&mdash;and there are not too many pastoral leases that they have bought that really run themselves&mdash;they will still have to pay themselves, so there will be a real wages bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paying that million dollars to pick up a pastoral property with a few head of cattle or sheep on it is only the beginning. There is a lot of ongoing cost. You have to buy fodder if you need it. You have to buy fencing and pay for its upkeep. Then there is the upkeep on windmills. These things do not look after themselves; you have to attend to them if you want a viable operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if you only want to live on the place, you have to keep up the windmills and the power generators. You have to do all those sorts of things and a lot of these people will have a lot to learn. After a few years they might wish they had stayed where they were rather than taking on such a venture. But I wish them well in their endeavours. </PARA>

I want the government to listen to that. It may be an economic lesson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that this legislation will provide environmental benefits. I want to look at that proposition. A pastoral station, a farm, or whatever, has a lot of environmental responsibility. You cannot overstock it but it is not much good understocking it either because then the weeds come up and start to gallop away. Even worse, after that you have to control them by use of chemicals. I am sure that Senator Chamarette's hair would stand on end if she even thought about that&mdash;but we should all think about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Environmental upkeep on a station is fairly high. You need fencing to keep stock out of some places and in other places. All those sorts of things have to be considered in farm management. Then there is flood damage and the damage caused by cyclones which has to be repaired. So it not all plain sailing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of social benefits, I am sure there will be some as a result of Aborigines being able to live in areas where their forefathers lived and with which they have cultural associations. But on the social side things might not be so rosy. Most Aboriginal people these days live in urban areas. Plenty of ordinary Australians would not trade the easy life of urbanised areas, especially in places like Canberra and Sydney and in the south-west of Western Australia, to go to the stations and outback life. Our pastoral industry is kept going by a dedicated few. But that is something we will see in due course. </PARA>

If someone could guarantee me that pastoral leases extinguished native title, as we were told in this chamber time and time again, I would not be so worried about last week's decision.

About 10,000 per year are processed by the mines department of Western Australia and its tribunals.

You tell me where Western Australia can send those 10,000 applications every year. You tell me where there is a tribunal. How many applications has the federal tribunal dealt with? You can count on your hand the ones it has dealt with in two years. What will you do with the 10,000 applications in Western Australia every year? And of those 10,000 that are held up every year, who will recompense the investors in mining and the people that are employed in mining?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A lot of words have been said but I want to put my words on the public record to indicate the Greens' view of this new presentation of the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill. I acknowledge that the legislation is part of the government's three-stage package in response to the High Court's decision on native title, the first stage being the Native Title Bill. It has been said that approximately five per cent of Aboriginal people may stand to gain from that native title legislation. At this point, 12 months or more down the track, we have not had any Aboriginal people gain, so the number of people who do gain by that provision may be much smaller than five per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the three-stage package concerns the land fund and the bill that we are looking at at the moment. The government said on this fund that it would deal with the land needs of the remaining 95 per cent of Aboriginal people who do not stand to gain from the native title legislation. Of course, we are yet to see a full response to the social justice package that has been proposed in recent days by the reconciliation council to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Greens have expressed repeatedly our disappointment with the proposal and its total failure to meet its aim to address the dispossession of 95 per cent of Aboriginal people over the last 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land fund is so small and its operation so constricted that only a small number of people will benefit from it. I am delighted to see that in the presentation of the bill and the second reading speech the language was far more restrained than in earlier times. We did not have the obnoxious reference to the $1.4 billion land fund. I wish the media could recognise the same inaccuracy and restrict their language about it too. The reality of this land fund is that at the very most it will provide $240 million in the next 10 years and extra on what is already available. There will be a draw down of $45 million a year indefinitely as a result of the amount put aside in the consolidated revenue, but that will be largely eaten up, as the debate earlier has showed, not only in management costs but also in administration of the fund itself. So we see a small amount developing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has developed a strategy that has been looking at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as three groups. One is those who have been least damaged by the impact of colonisation, seizure of lands and extinguishment of native title. That is the group of people who are fortunate enough to still be on their land and be able to disprove any claims by governments that their native title has been extinguished over the last 200 years. The second group is those who may be able to gain assistance from this land fund and gain access to this fund to buy back some country, and presumably pastoral leases will be the main target of these, as we can see from the comments of Senator Panizza: a pastoral lease could be expected to be gained for maybe $1 million, but we know that land in the city and in places where urban Aboriginal people live would scarcely be available. That means that the amount that is available will primarily be used in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am indebted to Senator Panizza for having far greater experience on this matter than me. He pointed out the total inadequacy of the amount, the way in which it will be eaten into by management requirements and the way in which the environmental concerns and the capacity to support numbers of Aboriginal people will be severely impeded by the lack of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third group are those who have been totally removed from their country and sometimes not even able to acknowledge what part of the country they were taken from. This is because, over the last 200 years, a lot of them were taken in childhood. Those who have been most damaged by colonisation will be last in the queue for this land fund. It is highly unlikely that they will ever gain anything from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we basically have is a land fund that will meet the needs of a very small number of people. Obviously there have been different views across Australia amongst Aboriginal people, and they revolve around the same dilemma that the Greens have expressed: do we put in place legislation that satisfies a small number&mdash;it may be a key number, but it is a small number&mdash;who stand to gain, and leave the large percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people dispossessed and, with their dispossession, unaddressed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accepting the land fund means accepting the fact that we will fail to a large degree to address those Aboriginal people who stand to gain nothing from this land fund. In fact, the existence of the land fund penalises them, because it allows the government to pretend that it has redressed the injustice of that dispossession. Senator Gareth Evans referred to this bill as a bill which establishes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a very substantial perpetual fund, and an Indigenous Land Corporation to use and administer that fund.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the key test of the amount of the fund is how much impact it has on the budget deficit this year. Because if it is a $1.4 billion fund&mdash;which, fortunately, most people realise it is not&mdash;it would presumably have a $1.4 billion impact on the deficit. If it is one-tenth of that amount, it is a similar amount. The reality is that the budget will increase by $24 million this year and each year after, and the budget deficit will diminish by $24 million for the next X number of years beyond the 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the symbol of what this government is prepared to do to redress the dispossession of Aboriginal people. That is why I feel a great disappointment with the opposition for its unwillingness to hold out a bit longer on this government and support the amendments that were raised and supported right around the country during the process of the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill. I think it is a disappointment. I can only assume that the opposition believes that tying Aboriginal people down to a pittance is better than nothing. I will quote from a statement by the Jandu Yawuru Women's Group, because I believe it sums it up very adequately. The women said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this piece of legislation Aboriginal people find themselves "caught between a rock and a hard place". It's tempting to grab whatever it is that is offered, especially when nothing was being offered to begin with. Country must be protected now, and land acquisition may be the best way to do this. Culture and tradition associated with that land must be protected and maintained now.</PARA>
<PARA>The women in that delegation went on to make some very cogent points. They stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst supporting the intent of the amendment bill, several of the amendments need to be reviewed. The point must be made that organisations such as ATSIC have the most to gain from both the original and amendment bill, and have the resources to lobby Aboriginal people in this matter. What other alternatives to the Indigenous Land Corporation have been put to Aboriginal people that reflects less centralised and more regional control, and that are true to Aboriginal self-determination?</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very valid point. If this bill is passed as it is, it will be a great disappointment to all those people who appeared before the committee and urged us to assert the inadequacy of the amount. In fact, that point was unanimous. I do not think there was anyone who did not refer to the inadequacy of the amount in the land fund and want more. Several submissions stated this; I cannot actually count them. One submission which was put at the Dubbo hearing of the Senate select committee urged us to reject the bill as proposed. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Senate amendments improve what would otherwise be very paternalistic and regressive legislation, the funding is far too inadequate for the Bill to be treated seriously. The original Bill undermines all the struggles of Aboriginal peoples in the last forty years to end Government paternalism and to demonstrate that they are capable of making their own decisions and that they should be allowed to do so.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The funding currently proposed for the Fund is completely inadequate. It represents an increase of only $25 million per year on what is already provided. The inadequacy of funding is likely to create conflict between Aboriginal communities and may see a disproportionate amount of the funding spent on management rather than on acquisition. This will disadvantage people who have no land.</PARA>
<PARA>We think the amount of the fund, because of the agreement between the opposition and the government, will not be addressed. Nevertheless, while Senator Evans has expressed the view that he would like this bill to pass unanimously in the chamber, the Greens cannot allow it to go by in that way. We will flag amendments that relate to the size of the land fund, the restrictiveness caused by it being held only by corporations, the disposal of surplus land, the fact that there is no statement which says that this is not to be regarded as compensation for dispossession and the revival of native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A final point was also raised by the Jandu Yawuru Women's Group relating to the gender balance on the ILC board. I will discuss that now because it has not been raised before. While the Jandu Yawuru Women's Group was making its statement to the Senate select committee, it presented something that had not been presented before. Certainly a question had been asked about gender representation, but basically the group recommended that there should be three Aboriginal women selected amongst the Aboriginal members of the board in order to ensure that those who stand to gain from this land fund are able to reflect on women's concerns, contact and connection with the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that is a further amendment that will be introduced into this bill for the very good reason that Aboriginal women took the trouble to come to the committee. Two delegations of women appeared before the committee: one in Darwin and the other in Broome. I believe that it does them justice to at least flag that point; whether or not it gains support is a moot point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I repeat the fact that the amendments that the Greens will move are largely designed to place on the public record our disappointment with this bill, the land fund and the government's response to the land needs of Aboriginal people. In his speech on this matter, Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original bill, with all the Senate's amendments, has been laid aside in the House of Representatives, and will expire when that house is prorogued for an election. So, the decks have finally been cleared for the parliament to approve this great measure of social justice.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why the Greens will be presenting just a small number of the amendments that it presented earlier. In the main they are not the ones that had support, although some are. We will be doing so because in the future there will be no other record of the concerns about that bill and we would like them on the record for this particular bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated before, the Greens are disappointed. But we feel that the opposition's bipartisan support with the government does two beneficial things: firstly, it reassures at least some Aboriginal people that a token attempt has been made to look at their land needs and that this may augur well for bipartisan approaches that should not be used as political footballs in election processes; and, secondly, it prevents the government from taking, quite unjustifiably, a high moral stand on this particular land fund. Government senators cannot complain that they are the only ones who want to see the land needs of Aboriginal people addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately for the Greens, the opposition is willing to tolerate the low level of funding available for Aboriginal people through this land fund, but at least it means that it is bipartisan and will not be used as a political football. I put on record that I heard the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) make his first election promise, which was that, should the coalition be elected, it will support the amendments as passed in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this is worth while, but I am extremely disappointed on behalf of all Aboriginal people who have not been adequately consulted before the design of this fund and who would have liked to have seen something far better produced if it were really to achieve the high words that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) spoke when he announced the fund during the debate on the Native Title Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition will, as is known in the chamber, not be opposing the passage of the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill, but I place on the record that National Party senators have reservations about the format of the government's legislation. We stand side by side our Liberal Party colleagues in believing that exemplary work was done when the predecessor of this bill was first presented and in the work that was done by Senator Ian Campbell and by Senator Chris Ellison. I think their work has been first class in terms of seeking to achieve a better result in the legislation. It is to the government's shame that it ignored the recommendations of the Senate&mdash;the Senate's amendments. It is to the government's eternal shame that it saw base political advantages being more important and therefore sought to bring in this other bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it very clear that, as far as the National Party is concerned, there are manifest defects in legislation which says that Aboriginal people are not to be trusted with freehold title to land. Earlier in the second reading debate, Senator Chris Evans from the other side of the chamber said that this legislation was important because it was the first time there was a recognition that Aboriginal people had rights. Leaving aside the mammoth political hyperbole in that, I doubt the extent of a right we give to people if we do not trust them to exercise judgment in relation to their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My friend on the other side of the chamber Senator Cooney may wish to think about how valuable a right is if it is a right which is curtailed. Senator Cooney and I could get into an interesting philosophical discussion here. A right which is limited in a fashion such that it is less than a right that somebody else may have in similar situations is not much of a right at all. That is my concern. This government legislation says that Aboriginal people are not to be given freehold title to the land in question which is purchased&mdash;it is to be under the control of a corporation&mdash;and they are to be precluded from enjoying the benefits of a freeholder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here there is a problem in the government's arguments because the only defence for that is saying that we do not trust Aboriginal people not to sell the land. If one argues that we do not trust Aboriginal people not to sell the land, it becomes very difficult to continue sustaining the argument that there is a particular special significance. Surely if there is a special significance for Aboriginals in holding land, it is appropriate that we trust them to preserve that special significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government wishes to have its cake and eat it too on this issue, because it wishes to say, `There is a special significance to Aboriginal people in the land but, having said that, we're not going to trust them that they will not sell it.' There is the conundrum. Ultimately, the government is condemned forever and a day to a paternalistic attitude that says, `We don't believe Aboriginal people are capable of exercising proper judgment in relation to these issues.' There is a yawning gulf between the Labor Party, the government, on that side and the coalition, the opposition, on this side because we believe it is time that we ended the era of paternalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation seeks to perpetuate paternalism for political motives. If one accepts the argument that we should search for a form of land-holding which is, in as close a sense as possible, consistent with the land tenure that Aboriginal groups had prior to white settlement, the way to do it is not to put the land in a corporation but to entrust the land on trust to elders. Surely that is more consistent with traditional Aboriginal concepts of the holding of land. Yet, we have this argument that we have to have a corporate structure. A corporate structure is entirely alien to traditional Aboriginal concepts of holding land, but a corporate structure is very useful for the government because it lets it utilise corporations for political advantage. Make no bones about it: that is exactly what will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we wish to be as bipartisan as we can on these issues, we have a moral obligation to the people of Australia to point out where the government will use this legislation for its political benefit and not for the benefit of Aboriginal people generally. That is undoubtedly the case. By denying Aborigines freehold title to land, this government denies individuals an opportunity to better their lot. It denies individuals the opportunity to have control of their own destiny. That is what the government will do with the passage of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying on behalf of the National Party is that we have grave reservations about many of the provisions of this legislation. Our point of view is that there should be no special laws for people on the basis of the colour of their skin. The government cannot say that this is a special law for people on the basis of the colour of their skin because, after all, the government has said that this is to rectify wrongs which occurred in the past. So there is no argument&mdash;no moral argument, no political argument, no argument based even on utility&mdash;which can justify the government then saying that it will make things special. Special laws really advantage the people at whom they are aimed. Special laws&mdash;this is an experience around the world&mdash;marginalise. Special laws condemn groups of people to the periphery of mainstream society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe very firmly that we have an obligation to ensure that the Australian community is as integrated and as equal as possible. I think it should be on the record that government senators who support these provisions and support the denial of freehold title are in their own way perpetuating the inequality about which the government complains. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other issues which we have reservations about. Those issues will be dealt with after the next election when the coalition government has the opportunity to right the wrongs to Aboriginal people which will be created by this legislation. I do not wish to delay the further passage of this legislation through the Senate, but I put the Labor Party on notice by saying that after the next election things will change and the Aboriginal people of Australia will soon realise that the government has sold them a pup and in many ways it has not taken a real and genuine interest in their needs. This legislation is proof of that and we will rectify that situation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we took Senator Chamarette's argument to its logical conclusion, we would find that she would say that we should give the land back to the Aboriginal people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is gratifying to the government that the coalition has finally seen the sense of the situation and agreed to pass the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994 in a form which will be efficient in practice and defensible in principle. It is a matter of regret that the same still cannot be said of the Greens. One would have wished that the opposition's motives in this matter had been a bit more exalted than simply the fear of fighting a double dissolution election in a policy area in which they continue to feel profoundly embarrassed&mdash;or if they do not, they should.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would have been preferable if the opposition had approached this issue with a real sense of understanding of the significance of the issues involved and a sense of grace about the great changes that are involved, with the enactment of both the native title legislation itself and this companion piece of legislation, the second stage of the government's response to the historic Mabo decision, establishing the land fund and recognising and making provision for recompense for the dispossession which has been suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would have been nice if the opposition had shown the same sort of grace and acknowledgment of the issues of principle involved as was shown in the speech yesterday by the new chief executive of CRA, Leon Davis, who did say&mdash;in what was clearly a groundbreaking change of position for his organisation and one which I hope will signal a similar change of direction for the whole mining industry&mdash;that he was `satisfied with the central tenet' of the act. He said further that the Native Title Act:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "laid the basis for better exploration access and thus increased the probability that the next decade will see a series of CRA operations developed in active partnership with the Aboriginal people".</PARA>
<PARA>That particular statement, which has been referred to by a couple of other speakers today, was appropriately responded to by Noel Pearson, the director of the Cape York Land Council, when he described those comments by the CRA chief as an `absolute milestone' in the relationship between Aborigines and the mining industry in Australia. He said further that the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . showed a "culture change" more tolerant of Aborigines was about to sweep across the mining sector&mdash;a change that would have been inconceivable just two years ago.</PARA>
<PARA>It is worth recording for posterity the cartoonist Nicholson's response to all this in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today when, under the heading `The sensitive new-age miner', we have a depiction of a miner standing on a rock with his arm around an Aboriginal Australian, with the Aboriginal saying to himself, `Well, bugger me. Next it'll be John Howard.' One hopes that it would be John Howard next. So far, unhappily, there has been no sign of that in terms of the basic response of this opposition to the Native Title Act, which it is still talking about fundamentally amending when it gets the chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no fundamental change of heart, it seems, in what those opposite are saying about the proposed land fund act, because they are talking about making further amendments to that, if and when they get a chance. There has not been a change of heart in the attitude to Aboriginal cultural sensitivities, as is revealed by the extraordinary saga over the Hindmarsh documents affair over the last week, where Mr Howard continues to stand behind his former front bench spokesman, Mr McLachlan, after Mr McLachlan engaged in what must be the most tawdry and unpalatable little exercise in recent Australian politics in distributing and photocopying sensitive documents, as he did, for crude political advantage in circumstances of the utmost sensitivity for the Aboriginal people involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I say all that because, although we are obviously pleased that there has been a sufficient change of heart on the part of the opposition to enable us to get this land fund legislation through, it unhappily does not seem to presage the kind of change of heart, change of mind and change of attitude that really would mean something for the Aboriginal people in this country. One can only hope that that will eventually occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are pleased that the coalition has not insisted on those of its amendments which would have made the ILC a statutory body excessively bound by legislative prescription. We simply hope that the coalition's threats to amend the bill, when and if it ever attains government, will fade away once the ILC is given the opportunity to prove itself under the flexible and autonomous approach that the bill provides for. In the end, a good piece of legislation does seem to have triumphed. The ILC will be able to get on with the job of acquiring and managing land on behalf of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be moving quickly to ensure that the ILC is set up by the end of the financial year.

I am not excluding those organisations which disagreed with some aspects of the bill. Differences of opinion are to be expected in relation to any piece of legislation, particularly a complex piece of legislation. They are hardly surprising in this situation here, given the diversity of circumstances of Australia's indigenous peoples. </PARA>

I do not think there is any question of gilding the lily in that respect. That is simply the case. ATSIC has been a very strong and effective supporter of this legislation from the outset. Of course we gave very significant weight to the views of ATSIC, the only organisation capable of representing indigenous opinion nationally and the government's adviser on indigenous matters, but we also took into account, and adopted wherever it was possible to do so, the views of other indigenous organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Might I close by repeating Senator Cooney's very gracious tribute to the public servants who have been involved in this very difficult exercise&mdash;Sandra Ellims and the rest of the team.

I take it that I will be a further beneficiary of their advice in the committee stage now about to dawn upon us.

<PARA>As I said, the first amendments relate to the size of the land fund. Just very briefly, for the public record, I will go through the reasons for them. Under the legislation, the government will contribute around $1.28 billion to a trust account in the Commonwealth public account called the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund over the next 10 years. The Greens (WA) are concerned that the fund will not be sufficient to meet the land ownership needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and that the fund will not be self-sustaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens also believe that the fund is unlikely to provide any degree of historical justice for the 95 per cent of Aboriginal people who will not gain anything from the recognition of native title. So our amendment proposes that the House of Representatives amend the bill so that one per cent of total Commonwealth government revenues will be placed in the land fund per annum for 10 years. This would see the government contribution exceed $11 billion at the end of 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why have we stipulated the one per cent? There are two reasons that I will briefly put here. The first reason is that it is a substantial sum. It really is the kind of substantial perpetual fund that Senator Evans referred to in his speech. However, it is not substantiated by the amount in the bill we are considering. Therefore, $1 billion a year is a substantial sum which would more satisfactorily address the land needs of Australia's indigenous people. One per cent of total revenue would see a government contribute about $1.12 billion per annum&mdash;a genuine billion dollar fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason for the one per cent is a historical one. In 1890 when the British handed self-government to Western Australia there was a clause placed in the constitution to ensure that the new government of Western Australia fulfilled its obligations to protect Aboriginal people. Under the clause, one per cent of total government revenue had to be spent on Western Australian indigenous people. The clause disappeared in 1904 and early this year a group of Aboriginal people began a challenge on this issue in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to us that if we are addressing historic injustice we ought to look at the historical attempts to redress that injustice that unfortunately have not operated in any way, shape or form within this country. So we felt that one per cent of total government revenue was a really good amount to be put in a land fund when we consider that that government revenue is derived from Australia and from the land of its original indigenous owners. That is all I wish to say about the size of the fund. The amendments come in the form of amendments and requests for amendments. I just leave it to the minister or anyone else to comment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Needless to say the government rejects these particular amendments, as we did last time around, and their companion volumes. The government will be allocating a very sizeable sum of $1.463 billion to the land fund over a 10-year period. Two hundred million dollars has been allocated this year to give the fund a significant base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual draw downs from the fund from 1995-96 will be $45 million per annum. This is more than double the $21 million spent by ATSIC on land acquisition and management annually. The ILC will also have the capacity to borrow from commercial sources or to facilitate land-holders borrowing from commercial sources. That will allow significant capital injections into indigenous land based enterprises over and above existing sources of capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really do believe that these amounts represent a significant commitment of Commonwealth moneys consistent with responsible economic management. The Greens' proposal, which is aimed at providing a fund of around $15 billion after 10 years, is completely unrealistic and fiscally irresponsible. The land corporation will be simply unable to handle the sum of about $450 million a year it would have available to spend on land acquisition and management. The availability of such an amount would artificially drive up land prices to the detriment of indigenous interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth currently provides around $1.5 billion annually to ATSIC and other agencies to address the needs of indigenous people. If the Commonwealth were to place one per cent of Commonwealth revenues in the land fund, this would amount to around another $1.5 billion annually. While we cannot be certain of Commonwealth revenues collected far into the future if the land fund were outside the public account, this amendment would contribute about $1.5 billion annually to the deficit and that would represent an addition of over 10 per cent to the budget deficit this year, rising to more than half the projected deficit in 1997-98. If the land fund were to remain in the public account, this amendment would add up to $270 million annually to the deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the orders of magnitude that we are talking about there, whichever way you approach this, simply put it beyond the pale in terms of our reasonable economic management strategies at the moment. The government has agreed to a Democrats amendment, it will be recalled, which will guarantee a four per cent return after inflation on investments over 10 years. The guarantee of that return is an addition to what is already a pretty sizeable allocation by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are committed to the reconciliation process. Mabo itself, the decision, the native title legislation and this fund have all advanced that process, but it has to be acknowledged that reconciliation is in its early stages. If we were to irresponsibly allocate around $15 billion to the land fund with no regard to the effects on the broader economy, there is a strong possibility that the reconciliation process itself would be put in jeopardy. I think that adds another dimension to our response to this. I think that point has been made clear enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to amendment No. 2, which goes to the method of investment of land fund moneys and the percentage to be  invested, it does appear to us inconsistent to repeal section 193A, as you are proposing, while retaining subsection 192W(3) which provides that land fund moneys have to be invested in accordance with section 62B of the Audit Act. Proposed new subsection (1) adds forms of investment permitted under state and territory laws to those permitted under section 62B of the Commonwealth Audit Act. It really appears that this would provide the lowest common denominator for prudential investments; it would not improve the bill. It is likely to create confusion rather than assist the fund to operate efficiently. In particular, it will never be clear which legislative authority is the basis for fund investments. In the event that the states amend their legislation, the legislative basis for long-term strategies could be undermined conceivably resulting in losses to the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are similar difficulties with proposed new subsection (2). It would, under the funding arrangements currently contained in the bill, provide a total annual draw down of only $36 million instead of $45 million, that is to say 25 per cent of $121 million. However, the new subsection is no doubt predicated on the bill being amended to provide for the massive funding sought by the Greens in their proposed amendment to section 193A, which the government cannot agree to. It might make sense in the context of such an increase but in the absence of that increase it just makes the bill go backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed new subsection (2) also seems to involve a drafting loophole. As drafted it would allow the ILC to spend the previous year's allocation since the 75 per cent limit here proposed only applies to the year the allocation was credited to the fund. So there are a whole variety of substantial reasons why the government opposes that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 3 and its companion piece No. 4 are also unacceptable. They, in our judgment, will result in a quite unworkable scheme and the government opposes them on that basis. In removing sections 193B to 193H, as is proposed, this amendment removes from the bill provisions for payments out of the fund to the ILC and ATSIC. It would appear that this would leave no legislative basis for the making of payments out of the fund. The assumption appears to be that the ILC will control the fund and not need some legislative basis. That is an inadequate assumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments would remove the requirement for the accounts and financial statements of the fund to be in a form determined by the Minister for Finance, which is presently provided for in section 193H. That again, in our judgment, is an unattractive proposition that further contributes to making the bill unworkable in this form. For all those complex reasons&mdash;at least it should show the Greens that we are taking them seriously&mdash;the government opposes these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments relate to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations. Under the bill, the ILC can carry out its land acquisition functions only for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations. The Greens believe that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be able to own land as they see fit and that the bill is far too restrictive on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This topic was raised with the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill. Many people felt that Aboriginal people should determine the capacity in which they held the land. While some felt that the corporations model, which has worked in other areas through ATSIC, has been a workable one for them, they felt that there was a legitimacy to other means being available and for the communities to be able to make that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that acquired interests in land&mdash;that is the purpose of these amendments&mdash;may be granted to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations, or Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders, or trustees of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander trusts. We have moved these amendments because we believe that Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders should be treated like any other citizens and be allowed to hold their land as they see fit. It is an act of paternalism  to do otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only outstanding issue would be the definition of `trust'. The Greens WA have adopted a definition which ensures that each person who benefits or is capable of benefiting is an Aboriginal person, a Torres Strait Islander or an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporation. It is our view that the reason why the government has been so restrictive in allowing only corporations to have it is, in a way, imposing a bureaucratic structure upon Aboriginal communities that makes it easier for corporations to be administratively handled. Presumably, if they fold, it makes it easier for the government to reacquire anything that the corporations have had in the time that they have been established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many committee hearings noted that Aboriginal people feel that corporations have in some ways done them an injustice. They have forced people to adopt this white bureaucratic convention of a legal entity. Those who are better able to understand those mechanisms have been able to benefit from them, sometimes to the detriment of some Aboriginal families and people within communities, when the corporation has perhaps folded through mismanagement or other problems. It is for that reason the flexibility of these amendments was proposed to be included in this bill&mdash;not, as has been publicised, to allow the land to be given to individuals but to prevent the bill from being so restrictive as to allow it only to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations and to allow Aboriginal communities to make their own determination of the entity which wants to hold any land that may be acquired through this fund. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this group of amendments the government's position remains implacably hostile because grants to individuals and trustees threaten to undermine the bill's fundamental purpose, as we see it. This group of amendments was moved by the opposition in both the House of Representatives and the Senate last year. We opposed the amendment then for the same reasons as we do now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill failed to find any consensus among indigenous peoples about this amendment, although a number of witnesses did explicitly endorse the government's original approach to the issue. The coalition's stated rationale for this amendment, and that again now by the Greens, is that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be treated like other Australians and should not be required to incorporate in order to have title to land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, other Australians do not have access to the land fund. This is a special case of unashamed positive discrimination designed to redress a past injustice. The land fund provides for indigenous people an avenue in addition to that available to all Australians to purchase land. Indigenous people will still be free to pursue the ordinary means of acquiring land if they do not wish to be bound by the restrictions on title to land acquired through this fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It all really goes back to the fundamental purpose of this whole exercise, which is to give indigenous people back their land and to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can enjoy the benefits of their land&mdash;land granted to them on this basis&mdash;for generations to come. Vestment of ownership incorporations will ensure that the land remains part of the Aboriginal land base for the use of future generations of indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal people did invariably hold in the past a communal form of title which was inalienable. They are familiar with operating on a collective basis. The Senate select committee purported to establish that individual ownership was traditionally accepted in some indigenous communities and based its argument on the testimony of one Torres Strait islander witness, yet it is abundantly clear from that gentleman's evidence that even he was in no way talking about individual ownership. He was referring to former familial ownership in which the structure of the owning family clearly extended well beyond what we would call a nuclear family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Grants to individuals run the risk of potentially excluding the rightful traditional owners&mdash;I am using the word `traditional' here in a loose sense because we are not talking in this context about people with native title claim as such&mdash;who are likely to be communities or groups. Besides being consistent with the fundamental purposes of the land fund bill, ownership by corporations does have some practical advantages. Corporate ownership does strengthen accountability through the statutory requirements which are placed on such bodies, including the need for them to report publicly on their activities. Allowing grants to trustees would mean that non-indigenous individuals and corporations could acquire legal ownership of land under the bill. Even though beneficial ownership would be with indigenous interests, there would not necessarily be a full indigenous ownership contemplated by the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a miscellany of points, but they all move in the same direction, which is that of the non-acceptability not so much this time in terms of workability but basic principle&mdash;the basic principle being that we want the land base to be maintained and retained for future generations. We see that corporate ownership is not only consistent with known Aboriginal tradition but also by far and away the best way to ensure that that in fact will be the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that this legislation is primarily designed for those who have been dispossessed and who are unable to recreate a claim in relation to some particular piece of land with which they have maintained traditional attachment. Of course, we have had this discussion often enough. That does not mean, however, that it is inappropriate to think in terms of the closest thing we can get to communal title as being the way to go when we are vesting land in these people. It is not a matter of white bureaucracy; it is the best that white bureaucracy can do to get close to what we are trying to do&mdash;that is, to recreate some kind of land base for those people who cannot establish a land base in any other way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just hung on that particular notion. It is also to do with the business of preserving that base as intact as possible intergenerationally for the future. It is linked with the question of alienability, which we are dealing with separately.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the reasons I supported the previous amendments&mdash;and these are similar to those&mdash;is that they give flexibility. I have a very great concern, shared by a lot of Aboriginal people, about the decline of job opportunities for Aboriginal people. I think it is fair to say that a greater percentage of Aboriginal people were working during the Great Depression than are working now. That is a very real concern. Admittedly, some of the Aboriginal people working at that time were working in very substandard conditions. That would absolutely not be tolerated and should not have been tolerated then. Nevertheless, in 1995 a great percentage of Aboriginal people are unable to find employment but want it. They want to be able to be creative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I supported the proposals that Senator Chamarette is giving another run to precisely because they would give flexibility to the management of the fund to ensure employment opportunities would be created in its administration. Thus, I believed it was necessary to have a more flexible arrangement than the inflexible one that appears to be in the legislation at this time. I apologise to the committee for raising this matter again but it worries me very much that a number of Aboriginal people who want to be employed and engaged in creative and income generating work do not have the opportunity. Could the government now, or at some stage, give the Senate its views about that very important issue?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the aspirations we have is that property will be able to be vested for income earning and job generating purposes, for enterprise development purposes. I take very seriously the point Senator Harradine makes. I hope the ILC will bear that objective in mind in disposing of its funds. That said, I do not think the requirement that it be vested in corporate structures rather than individuals would necessarily inhibit flexibility in pursuing that enterprise objective to quite the extent Senator Harradine suggests. It is an interesting point he raises and one that can certainly be kept under review when we look at the way the legislation operates. If there is any unnecessary inhibition of the objectives he is pointing to, we might usefully debate that at some future time in the light of any accumulated data.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think Senator Harradine is astray at all in suggesting that that should be a legitimate aspiration for the use of the fund. If employment opportunities can be generated, so much the better. It is not the only objective. The use and enjoyment of land for purposes approximating traditional purposes is a very legitimate usage as well, giving people a sense of space and access to land which urban, dispossessed Aboriginal people might well be craving. It does not necessarily have to have an economic component but there is certainly no reason why it should not and every reason why, at least in part, some funds should be directed to that objective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point that I was trying to make&mdash;and I think it has been borne out by Senator Harradine's comment&mdash;is that by restricting the fund to corporations the bill could penalise or disadvantage some Aboriginal people in urban areas for whom a corporation is a very artificial entity&mdash;an excessive administrative hoop. They may have natural entities that are more amenable to allowing them that independence.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ILC should have the flexibility to make grants of land to individuals, groups and families, as well as corporations. Whilst acknowledging the long-held principle of indigenous community ownership, we must be conscious of the changing place, role and contribution of Aboriginal people in contemporary Australia, particularly urban localities . . . We have fought long and hard for equal rights; let us not be constrained by traditional ownership practices that are foreign to many in contemporary indigenous communities in the south-east of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The other comment was from the Ballarat and District Aboriginal Cooperative Ltd which maintained:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . land [should] be owned by the indigenous people with no conditions or restrictions of their right to make all decisions in respect to the land including the right to sell even after a short period of time . . . Although traditional Aboriginal culture has been for community control/care of the land, we assert that the Aboriginal people should have the same rights as other Australians . . . be it as corporations, individuals, groups of individuals or trustees . . . The argument of Corporations being answerable [to the ILC] is further evidence of government desiring to keep control of and take decision making away from Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the point of these amendments. I concede that the government is not going to move on them but I want it on the public record that it is a paternalistic measure, intended to restrict Aboriginal people from being able to have a real say on how they will own and manage their land. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments relate to the disposal of surplus land by the ILC. The bill as it stands permits the ILC or its subsidiaries to dispose of land that it no longer needs to hold. As in the case where the ILC should own or acquire land for the purposes of making a grant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the Greens WA believe that it is appropriate that relevant people and bodies be consulted before the ILC disposes of any land. </PARA>

So it is really a mechanism to permit the efficient passing over of the land to the people for whom it has been acquired. It removes the capacity of the ILC to hold on to it or to dispose of it without consulting those people. </PARA>

A second situation which could easily arise as a matter of routine is where land which was originally purchased by the ILC is surrendered to the ILC for disposal on behalf of the land-holders. Another situation could arise where the ILC is unable to find an appropriate body to hold title to land which it has purchased. In the event that there were people affected by the disposal, we would certainly expect the ILC to consult them as a matter of good administration.

<PARA>I think these amendments are the most exciting amendments because they have not been seen before in the debate. I move them on principle, not that I am unduly unrealistic about the outcome. They relate to the gender balance on the ILC board, and they arise from the views of Aboriginal women in Broome who appeared before the Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill. I believe a reference was also made by Aboriginal women who appeared in Darwin. They wanted to make sure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women were equally represented on the ILC board. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to increase in the bill the minimum number of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders from five to six. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am putting these amendments on the record for the Jandu Yawuru women's group. It was one of the best moments in the debate and in the committee's consultations when they asked some questions and made this suggestion regarding representation on the board. They were followed by a group, whose name I cannot immediately recall, I believe from Kununurra. Its members stated that they felt it only just to have three Aboriginal women on the board, but they wanted the male representation not to be penalised by the constriction of up to five Aboriginal representatives on the board of seven. They wanted the number increased to six so there could be three men and three women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having placed that on the record and having urged honourable senators to think about what that means before they pass or reject it, I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) for an update on the process by which the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) will appoint the board. Is it at all possible for the consideration of this amendment, or is that process so far advanced that it would not be possible to include it? I urge him to do that because right throughout the committee proceedings we heard people saying that they did not mind the minister appointing persons provided he received nominations perhaps one from each state or from various regions of Australia. The idea that he might arbitrarily appoint a number of people was not contemplated by or did not impress many. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will certainly bear those comments in mind, but we do not feel we ought to be constrained by a formal rule of the kind that is proposed. As to the need for gender balance, for a start we certainly favour boards balanced on gender grounds wherever possible. However, there will be circumstances where there will simply be insufficient men or insufficient women with the particular skills or experience required for membership of a board who, in turn, are available to serve on it. In such cases,  we certainly would  not  want  to have the options to appoint a suitably qualified board limited by a prescription of this kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the proposal of at least six indigenous members, the bill allows for a board that could be entirely indigenous but it does not make that a requirement. It is likely that the board will be all indigenous when there are indigenous men and women with the appropriate level of expertise available to be part of it. But it is important that the ILC is able to use the skills and experiences of non-indigenous experts when it happens to be the case that there are no indigenous people available or when there is an insufficient number to play that role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is based on the indigenous commercial development corporation model, which provides that five out of the nine board members must be indigenous. I think it is worth stopping for half a second to note that a number of quite vital contributions have been made to that corporation by some of its non-indigenous members who have been appointed because of their expertise in financial and business matters. I do not think in this context it is invidious to name some names. I am thinking of people like Brian Wright of the Commonwealth Bank, Sir Lawrie Willett, who is head of the Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd, and Professor Bob Walker, who I think is widely regarded as Australia's pre-eminent independent expert in public sector accounting. As it stands, we think the bill provides the correct balance between the need for indigenous direction and self-determination and the need to ensure that there is appropriate expertise on the board. For that reason, we will not support the amendments. But I recognise the aspiration. We are not unsympathetic to that, and in practice we will try to get there. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment inserts at the end of clause 3 a new division concerning dispossession. Currently, the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1995 does not make clear whether compensation is intended for dispossession. The Greens believe this bill should not be seen in any way as compensation, and nothing in it should prevent claims for compensation being made in the future. The Greens are concerned that the associated rhetoric from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) might lead people to understand that this is the major act of compensation for dispossession. It has been repeatedly stated that this is the major financial component following from the High Court decision on native title. It may then lead to the land fund being taken as compensation for the dispossession of the last 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compensation for dispossession does not come at $45 million a year, or $24 million a year more than is currently available. Compensation for dispossession would be incalculable. The Greens see it as important that the legislation leaves the option open for compensation to be sought at another time. Thus, the legislation should include a clause which specifically states that this is not compensation for dispossession and that nothing in this bill prevents claims for compensation being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already talked about how many people are going to benefit from this fund. The reality is that those who already know that they will never get access to that minute amount want some kind of guarantee that they will not be regarded as having gained some kind of compensation at a governmental level for which they have not received anything. It is for that reason that they want it stated within the bill as a disclaimer that prevents them from being disadvantaged in any way by taking that stand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment here creates a new division at the end of part 4 of the ATSIC Act which deals with the extinguishment of native title on indigenous held land. This amendment statutorily sets aside any extinguishment of native title on any land which has been acquired, set aside or dedicated for the benefit of Aboriginal people or Torres Strait Islanders. In doing so, it provides for the revival of native title similar to the revival of native title on mining leases under the Native Title Act 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the object of this bill is to restore land to Australia's indigenous people, it is important that the land be restored to them in terms which are appropriate to them. If this land is to be treated as indigenous held land, as the government keeps arguing, it should be treated as other indigenous held land, as land where native title rights remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an earlier discussion, Senator Evans used the words `communal, inalienable title' in order to justify corporations having the land as being the closest equivalent to the `communal, inalienable title' of Aboriginal culture. We are proposing that the revival of native title allows that inalienable aspect of land that is acquired under the land fund to be made available to Aboriginal people. It would offset the concerns, which I have not agreed with, which have been referred to by Senator Evans as wanting to keep control of the Aboriginal estate by using corporations as the means by which the land is held rather than actually giving it to Aboriginal people in whatever form their community feels is most appropriate and then allowing them to revive native title in such a way that that communal, inalienable title is really reflected. That is the purpose of that final amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is not much prospect of a change of heart, I am afraid. I do not want to disappoint you, but that's the breaks. As to amendment 19, it is wrong to claim that nothing in the bill is intended as compensation for the dispossession indigenous people have suffered. The provision of $1 1/2 billion for the acquisition of land is intended as one step in the process of recognition of indigenous possession and some compensation for that dispossession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens are mistaken in their view that the government considers this as the totality of a final settlement. It has been stated over and over that this bill is only part of the government's broad response to the Mabo decision. There is nothing in the bill which states that this is the government's final position or action, and I can assure Senator Chamarette it is the government's view that a good deal more should and will be done to address the issue of dispossession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to prior extinguishment being disregarded, can I say&mdash;it is a little complicated but I need to put the government's position clearly on the record&mdash;that this proposal means that, if any land is acquired or set aside for the benefit of indigenous people for any purpose, any previous extinguishment of native title over that land will be disregarded and presumably native title re-established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This section would apply to any acquisition or dedication of land under any Commonwealth law whether related to this act or not. It is at least arguable that the provision would apply to state laws. This section would provide for the non-extinguishment of native title even over land which has been freehold title for over 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment shows a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of native title which exists only where indigenous people have maintained their connection with the land. There will also be major difficulties in determining who the native title holders are, if any, when the extinguishment occurred a long time ago. That again raises further potential for significant dispute and conflict among indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed section differs from section 47 of the Native Title Act in the following ways: section 47 only applies to pastoral lease land, not to all land; section 47 builds in the requirement of continuing attachment to the land; and section 47 also provides for pastoral leases to remain in place and coexist with native title. There is nothing in this proposal to provide for the situation where the revived native title and the acquired interests are not in the hands of the same indigenous people. This is another potential source of conflict and division between Aboriginal groups: for example, where the corporation attempts to assist a group of Aboriginal people by granting it land to which it had no prior connection and the native title to that land, as re-established, is held by a different group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can imagine a number of examples where this provision will create extraordinary difficulties. For example, if the Commonwealth funds the purchase of land to set up a health centre in the middle of Sydney for the benefit of the Aboriginal communities there, the native title to the land on which that centre is situated may continue to be held by the so-called traditional owners. If the ILC purchased an office block in a CBD for investment purposes similar to the New South Wales land funds purchase in Parramatta and then later wished to realise that investment, it could not do so. If the ILC wished to rationalise a number of purchases through swaps of land, linked sales or acquisitions, similarly there would be difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, complex compensation issues may arise for the ILC and other Commonwealth agencies especially where land acquired for the benefit of indigenous people is subsequently used for some other purpose or disposed of. The ILC and other bodies may be precluded from granting land or using it for the purpose for which it was acquired because the possible existence of native title makes that act an impermissible future act for the purposes of the Native Title Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment is completely at odds with the Greens' previous support for the removal of controls on the disposal of land in section 191S because native title land is, by its nature, inalienable. There are a number of strikes there which Senator Chamarette might conceivably be prepared to acknowledge. I think I have covered the terrain in more than adequate detail to indicate why it is that the government cannot accept that amendment either.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to place on the record the reasons the Greens cannot and will not be supporting this land fund.

It is one that recognises that the Senate is about to pass this legislation, making some small concession in giving access to a land fund to a small number of Aboriginal people across the country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr John Fahey and Mr Bob Carr are fighting the New South Wales election due to be determined next Saturday on the proposition that society wants to lock away for ever those it would be rid of. Both leaders are intent on that strategy. They would imprison men and women for decades in close to arbitrary fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The abuse of arbitrary power corrodes the quality of any community. Criminals misuse such power when they murder, rape, maim, steal and blackmail. Monopolies do so when they ply their trade in defiance of consumer rights. Contractors follow that course when they oppress their workers. So do parents when they violate their children. Partners do likewise when they excoriate each other on parting. Governments abuse arbitrary power when they jail a class of people indifferent to the particular circumstances of each of its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens to law enforcement in New South Wales may in the future spread to other states and the Commonwealth. A statute made in Macquarie Street taking away a court's capacity to judge people on their merits may come to taint criminal justice throughout Australia. We need all address the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three questions face a judge about to sentence a convict: firstly, what has this criminal done; secondly, who is he or she; thirdly, what ought be done with him or her? From what Mr Fahey and Mr Carr have proposed, the courts will be allowed to answer the first question only. Parliament is to take the other two away from them. This usurps the proper role of judges. To attach a maximum penalty to a crime is a function of parliament. To impose an appropriate sentence on a particular individual for a specific wrong he or she has perpetrated is a duty of the judiciary. Were the legislature to invade the proper province of the courts as advocated in the current election, the right balance between them would be grossly disturbed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A long sentence is not necessarily a wrong one but a judge ought not award it automatically. A judge ought to take into account a number of matters when sentencing convicts. These include their role in the crime, the harm they have done, what efforts they have made to redress it, their character, their social and cultural history, their age and the quality of their remorse. When parliament fixes a mandatory rather than a maximum term of imprisonment for a crime, it puts at risk the free, democratic and liberal society most Australians want. It countermands the imperatives arising from the uniqueness of each individual and those of fairness, compassion and propriety. People subject to the criminal justice system are treated as little more than automatons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How society treats those at its margin is a key test of its worth. A community which embraces the rich, the powerful, the beautiful and the healthy, while spurning the poor, the weak, the ugly and the sick, is grievously flawed. Where it treats the criminal as no more than refuse to be cast into a garbage bin and buried for a generation, it perverts the humanity of all of its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are times when the public is unfairly critical of political leaders. During their careers, both Mr Fahey and Mr Carr have done many good things and deserve much praise. But on this issue, where each commits himself to outdoing the other in locking away law breakers in New South Wales, indifferent to the demands of justice and morality, they both fail miserably as men of principle.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a very serious matter in the adjournment debate tonight; that is, the conduct of senior executive officers within the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The matter in question relates to issues first aired by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, Senator David Brownhill, and myself in the estimates committee immediately following the last federal election. We had details of financial impropriety which was alleged to have been committed by a number of senior executive officers within the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To cut a long story short, extracting the information on these improprieties was a bit like pulling teeth: getting the officers to acknowledge that there was even reason for concern was a very difficult process. As a consequence of that, the estimates hearings relating to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service were particularly protracted sessions, and they did not bring a lot of satisfaction to any of the people who were involved in the whole process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May last year, charges were brought under the Public Service Act against one officer&mdash;an officer by the name of Phillip Corrigan. As at November last year, the official inquiry under section 61 of the Public Service Act into those charges had only just commenced, and the inquiry officer had not been able to do anything in the interim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Brownhill and I were not told on 29 November was that that officer in question had obtained permission from the secretary to the department to have extended leave of absence so that he could take up a high paying job in the United Kingdom. That high paying job in the United Kingdom was to head the operations executive of the new meat hygiene division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our understanding from information provided to us that Mr Corrigan may have been aided in obtaining that position by references provided by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service itself, and not by individual officers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service personally writing references. We understand that there may have been the belief in the United Kingdom that Mr Corrigan went with an official reference from AQIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the officer was under investigation on six charges of impropriety under the Public Service Act which carry penalties of up to dismissal, it is particularly disturbing that that possibility may even arise. The estimates committee was not told on 29 November that this was the case. Nobody even attempted to tell senators attending the estimates committee that Mr Corrigan had already obtained approval for his extended leave of absence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Corrigan is now the subject of questions in the House of Commons because word has travelled over there about the charges against him. Members of parliament in the United Kingdom take a different view about financial propriety to that which was expressed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins). He seemed to think at the estimates hearing on 15 February that it was all well and good that Mr Corrigan should have obtained this job in the UK and that it was a great feather in our cap. Parliamentarians in the United Kingdom have a different view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is turning into a scandal in the UK. The view over there is that it is entirely improper that this officer should have obtained references from his colleagues at AQIS and been fixed up with a job in the UK with their assistance. They got him out of the country and unloaded him onto the United Kingdom. That is exactly what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is unsatisfactory, because I believe that this sort of going on blemishes the good name and integrity of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. For Mr Corrigan to be able to obtain these references and be fitted up with a job in the United Kingdom is quite simply a slur on the integrity of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. It should never have happened. It happened only because there was a failure of proper management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also my understanding that findings have been made in relation to those six charges. I am waiting for the official advice from the minister as to exactly what the situation is. I understand that Mr Corrigan has been advised. I also understand from journalists that Mr Corrigan does not want to answer any questions about the results of the findings on those six charges. I can only surmise why Mr Corrigan does not want to answer any questions. I can only assume that, if Mr Corrigan had been found innocent on all six charges, he would have been very happy to answer questions from journalists. I understand from a journalist who contacted Mr Corrigan that he was not particularly keen to talk about the issue at all, which suggested to me that Mr Corrigan has not had the benefit of six verdicts of innocent. I am concerned that these matters, which I was told were finalised on 15 February&mdash;</PARA>

It is now becoming an embarrassment to this nation and an embarrassment to our primary producers. That is the simple fact about it. Senator Crowley, on the other side of the chamber, shows the Labor Party's attitude to these matters: do not talk about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of record that these charges were finalised on 15 February. The Labor Party's contempt for the estimates process has meant that there is still no official advice from the minister as to the outcome of the charges, notwithstanding an undertaking on 15 February that they would be provided forthwith. So much for the Labor Party's view of accountability. That is disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister must immediately make available the findings and details of each of the six charges so that we can assess exactly what has happened in AQIS. The idea that the secretary to the department would allow this officer to have extended leave of absence so that he could go over to the United Kingdom and take a high paying job whilst he is still facing charges here&mdash;and knowing that if that officer is found guilty of the charges it will be an embarrassment to AQIS and the Australian government&mdash;is in itself very disturbing, notwithstanding the fact that this officer may have knowledge of other financial impropriety which was committed by other members of the senior executive service of AQIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has not been a pleasing task to be involved with, but it is something that has to be done to protect the financial interests of producers whose livestock is ultimately inspected by AQIS and who rely for their overseas earnings on the good work of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Growth will halt refugees, says NCC", went some way towards explaining the puzzling support that the National Civic Council has been giving over the years to the boat people. That support has been overt and covert. They have used their WA State Secretary, Richard Egan, sometimes on behalf of fringe organisations, but their covert operations are less easy to delineate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NCC have infiltrated political parties, service organisations and refugee support groups. Their influence in some refugee support groups has had such effect that some of these groups work exclusively for boat people, ignoring the 13,000 refugees who are settled in Australia each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The article states that the NCC want to populate and develop Northern Australia&mdash;"Clearly the only way is to seek to inhabit and exploit the area". The NCC weekly bulletin "News Weekly", says that it is naive to say that Australia cannot be allowed to be overpopulated because of our poor soils and shortage of water. The article suggests that there is plenty of water, and that this can be used to expand the economic potential of the area. They cite the Ord River Scheme to prove their point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hidden agenda may now be obvious. The encouragement they have given to some groups of refugees can possibly be explained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They want to populate Northern Australia with wealthy (those who can afford passage on a boat) Asians who are "fleeing Communist regimes".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By giving encouragement and support to boat people, they ensure that the flow will continue. When the flood becomes too big, Australia will be forced to accept and settle these people.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the future for Australia if the NCC's sinister plot comes to fruition?</PARA>
<PARA>I end the letter there with my salutations and signature. I make the point that this letter was circulated on 3 March 1995. I did not seek in putting forward those strong words to use the privilege that is extended to me as a senator representing the people of Western Australia to make remarks that I could not substantiate in another place&mdash;be it in this place or out there in the broader community. I have never sought to abuse or misuse the privilege of this place. That letter is on the record and has been sent to some hundreds of people in my constituency of Western Australia. I have also used the text in different contexts in various interviews that I have done again back in my home state of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 March this year, 6PR radio station interviewer Rob Broadfield interviewed both Senator O'Chee and me in regard to the general matter relating to boat people but in particular the legislation that is before this chamber, which I do not seek to canvass during the adjournment debate because that would be wrong and in contravention of the standing orders of this place. From my point of view, there was a very lively debate between Senator O'Chee and me, with Mr Broadfield having to act on some rare occasions as a moderator to keep both of us in check. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was quite happy with the comments that I had made according to the printed record of the interview that was given to me at a later time. I was surprised to find today that, while I was out of the building&mdash;I am trying to look after my health for a change&mdash;Senator O'Chee again used the chamber to get up and make some suggestions about my comments on the radio. He concluded that I was not here. The information that I have from other people in the building who were here was that his language was strong. I understand it was much stronger than the words that were recently challenged in the chamber about being outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand from what I have been told&mdash;and I do not know this for certain myself&mdash;that, if those comments had not been made under the privilege of the parliament, I might now be talking to my lawyers instead of making a contribution to the adjournment debate. I do not know that for certain because I do not have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record of Senator O'Chee's comments. I will not get that until tomorrow, but when I do get it we will see whether or not the same principles that I adhere to in terms of the privilege of the parliament have been respected by my opponent on the other side. I do not know. The record will prove it at a later time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been told, however, that during the course of Senator O'Chee's comments today he misquoted me. I am not making any assertions or allegations. I have been told that, and I will hold my counsel until that is proven by the record tomorrow. I was told that it was in the context of an interchange between Mr Broadfield and me that a certain thing was said. I am doing this from second-hand information, but from my point of view it is important to put the record straight. That is why I am seeking to do this. If I am wrong, I will most graciously stand up in this place tomorrow and apologise. I have been told that the part I have been misquoted in relation to was the following extract from my record of the interview:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ROB&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which was the presenter or the moderator&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, the National Civic Council, Bob Santamaria's mob as most Australians would know it, you are saying, is in league with the opposition now?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SENATOR MCKIERNAN: No, no, no. I am saying that the NCC have infiltrated political parties, refugee support groups and others in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ROB: To what end?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ROB: With Asians?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SENATOR MCKIERNAN: To populate the northern end of Australia. To keep the pressures off countries in the Asian region which they say are over populated.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ROB: Okay.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the record will show this tomorrow but I am told that it was at the time the reference to Asians came in that Senator O'Chee added some additional words to the comments in the record that I have and also went on to say that I was going to say something else but did not say it&mdash;which, if what I have been told is true, will completely and utterly distort the record in a most unfair way. I have not had the opportunity because of other events, such as the transcript reaching me only recently and our adjourning early, to show it to the opposition. But it is available. I am more than happy to supply it. I will not try to subvert the practices of this place by seeking to table it because I have not had the opportunity to show it to the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by making the comment that I stand by everything I put in the letter to my constituents on 3 March, I stand by my comments that I made on 10 March, and if I have upset some people with those comments I have done so on behalf of the people of Western Australia, my constituents in Western Australia, and those long-suffering taxpayers who have been exploited to the hilt by a small number of people who are acting sometimes in a not too professional manner in support of illegal entrants to this country. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP> (7.19 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add some remarks to those already made by my colleague Senator O'Chee about AQIS. The Senate estimates process is designed to obtain information from an assessed performance of the commonwealth Public Service. Over the years it has been used in various ways by various senators from various political persuasions. During my period in the Senate the officers who have come before Senate estimates committees have become increasingly adept at avoiding issues and so skilled at providing information that has so little substance that it renders the estimates process rather difficult.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1993, a series of questions were asked of officers from AQIS and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. It was a simple line of questioning based on information conveyed to the Queensland parliament about travel irregularities involving senior officers within AQIS. The concern of senators at the time, including Senator O'Chee, was that this department was in the process of moving to full cost recovery and was, in this case, predominantly in the rural sector and there were allegations and evidence to suggest that certain officers were abusing the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not waste the time of the Senate by outlining the exhaustive process that followed, suffice it to say that my office and Senator O'Chee's office pursued the issue largely as a result of the stonewalling we received in the first estimates hearing and subsequent hearings in September and November 1993. We learnt through our investigations that several officers had breached Public Service guidelines. We uncovered a range of inappropriate activities, a series of cover-ups and a total lack of cooperation by officers both within AQIS and the wider the department for the estimates process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During our inquiries and as a result of the mismanagement that we exposed, the head of AQIS was transferred and an officer from another department was brought in as the head of AQIS. Obviously, the department was hopeful that the matter would be dropped. I am afraid it was not. As Senator O'Chee has advised, one officer involved in that original line of questioning was purportedly found to be in dereliction of his duty resulting from issues we raised nearly two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite coincidentally that officer is no longer in Australia. It is of some concern to me and other senators that this officer is now in a senior position in the United Kingdom Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. How he obtained that position and on whose recommendations he was sent from Australia is yet to be determined. Obviously, the ability and the willingness of the Australian authorities to pursue those charges, of which I understand he has found to be in error, also needs to be examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I wish to raise is that when changes were made to the organisation in November and December 1993 we were given to understand that a new regime and a commitment to service had been adopted. During the rural and regional affairs committee hearings into the legislation relating to domestic meat charges there were calls from inside and outside the parliament for an inquiry into AQIS. That should have happened. It was generally agreed that it would be more appropriate to wait to allow the new management to establish itself and to allow time for the promised reform regime to commence, so we waited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry was finally established late in 1994 and the first hearings were held earlier this month. I must say that we have not had a very auspicious start. Our first witness, Mr Don Ford, refused to provide details of the allegations he had mentioned in the media. He claimed that he had passed his concerns on to the minister and was awaiting the minister's response before proceeding further. The minister has told the Senate that inquiries are proceeding. I think it interesting for us to note that fact. I think that that may be contempt of a Senate inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second hearing of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee provided the opportunity for AQIS senior officers to demonstrate a new cooperation with the parliament. They too refused to comment on Mr Ford's allegations claiming, as we have seen happen with the minister, that they did not have the details. I believe that that also put us in a rather difficult position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the allegations Mr Ford has made relate to incidents which Mr Ford has already said publicly were subject to incident reports to the appropriate AQIS officers. In other words, I know and AQIS knows that the incidents Mr Ford refers to are already on the AQIS files. For the AQIS officers to suggest that they are not aware of the substance of the allegations implies that AQIS either is not coming clean or is incompetent or hiding something. That saddens me because I believe that that matter should have been cleared up a couple of years ago so that AQIS retained a good name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the situation where a former AQIS officer, a key witness to the whole issue of the integrity of AQIS, has left Australia. He still has charges hanging over his head which emanate from the estimates inquiries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an article which says that inquiries were made in the usual way about Mr Corrigan before his appointment, including from his previous employer, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. Basically, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has given Mr Corrigan a recommendation for the position that he is now in. Mr Corrigan is now in a senior position in the United Kingdom government as a result of that recommendation from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process has taken two years. I think this says nothing for public accountability and says little for the consultative process and the expressed desire by departmental officers to cooperate with the Senate. I include the minister when I say that because I think he should have given us the information that Mr Ford had given him that did not pertain to Mr Corrigan or others earlier so the allegations surrounding Mr Ford could have been cleared up. </PARA>

I will continue to pursue the issue of accountability and integrity. I think the Senate should ensure through you, Mr President, or others that parliamentary committees are not held in contempt.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today I raised in passing the fact that the bankruptcy of the Labor Party in New South Wales, financial as well as moral and political, was evident from the fact that Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd has assets amounting to, at the most, $1.8 million and appears to have liabilities of about $10 million. It is hard to tell which element of the Labor Party owes who what.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I made in passing was that it is very hard to tell exactly how disastrous the situation is in financial terms for the Labor Party in New South Wales and how bankrupt it really is because Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd has not lodged its annual return. In fact, the 1993 annual return is not complete. That is the case with a lot of shonky organisations. I note that its annual returns for 1991, 1992 and 1993 were all lodged in one lump on 10 March 1994. In  other words, there has been a blatant breach of the requirements of the Australian Securities Commission by this subsidiary of the Labor Party&mdash;a subsidiary which is a bottomless pit, which cannot work out its accounts and which has not provided any key financial data because it does not have it. It appears to be in continuing breach of a whole range of matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a letter which Mr John Della Bosca, the company secretary of Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd and also secretary of the New South Wales Labor Party, wrote when he filed the 1993 annual return, which has not been regarded as a proper return by the Australian Securities Commission. That letter was signed on 2 March 1994, a year ago. In it he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key financial data has been excluded from this return due to circumstances beyond the control of the Company Secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is him. `It is not my fault,' he says. It must be Stephen Loosley's, I guess. He then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial data has been prepared, but as the ultimate control of this company rests with voluntary officials, a commitment for the Directors to sign the accounts has not been given.</PARA>
<PARA>I guess that if I were one of the directors of this company, I would be very reluctant to put my name to this shonky organisation. He further states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Company Secretary endeavours to provide the key financial data on Form 902, supplementary document before 30/6/1994.</PARA>
<PARA>That, as the Senate can tell, was nine months ago and there is still no key financial data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) put out a press release today because, as I understand it, the gallery was being misinformed by the Labor Party&mdash;in particular by Mr Della Bosca's wife, who happens to be a Labor senator for New South Wales&mdash;that it did not have to put out the key financial data, that there was no need to. She has made a basic error because on the form that Mr Della Bosca signed and sent to the Australian Securities Commission, there is a question, `Were the company accounts for the financial year audited?' and that box is ticked `No'. The accounts were not audited. The Labor Party cannot get away with the shonky trick of saying, `We do have an auditor and therefore we don't have to provide accounts.' But the auditor has not audited the accounts, presumably because the accounts are not in a state capable of being audited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would certainly get that impression because the ASC has threatened on a previous occasion to deregister this company for not complying. The subsidiary in New South Wales of the Australian Labor Party has been threatened twice by the ASC with deregistration for not complying. The previous time&mdash;1994 was the latest time&mdash;was back in December 1992. I will read a letter dated 9 December 1992 from Mr John Della Bosca to the Australian Securities Commission:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We refer to your letter dated 30 November 1992 and wish to advise you that the above company is in operation.</PARA>
<PARA>The ASC could not have told whether it was in operation because the company had not provided any annual returns. By the way, I do hope that the directors of this company have received penalties for failing to meet the requirements of the Australian Securities Commission. It is pretty ordinary, is it not, when officials of the Labor Party&mdash;which claims it has the capacity to run the state of New South Wales&mdash;cannot even abide by the Australian Securities Commission requirements and, presumably, receive penalties? Unless, of course, they had some mate fix it up for them. Mr Della Bosca goes on to state in the letter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are currently experiencing administrative difficulties affecting the company's accounting and secretarial functions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The simple answer is that they cannot add up&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are addressing these issues but we believe it will take 6 months to be in a position to lodge annual returns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would appreciate your confirmation that you will grant a 6 months moratorium in complying with the Corporations Law requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, it was not just six months. That letter was dated 9 December 1992 and it took them until March 1994 to get around to filing the annual returns. Once again, they were inadequate because the financial matters were inadequate. All these returns were filed in one hit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say this to the Labor Party: just by putting down the name of an auditor who has not audited the books&mdash;because the books are not in a state to be audited&mdash;and admitting that the books were not audited, it cannot get away with dodging the requirements, sneaking around the rules and breaching the law that the ASC administers by that kind of shonky device. Sure, when Labor was last in government in New South Wales it did all those shonky things; it did get around everything; it did have corruption&mdash;yes, that is the way Labor runs because you cannot trust Labor with money. That is evident, once again, from these accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting that one of the things Mr John Della Bosca had to swear was this: that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the company will be able to pay its debts when they fall due. That must be one of the greatest jokes of all time. It would be interesting to see whether Mr John Della Bosca&mdash;let alone the directors who do not want to contribute their names&mdash;would be prepared to swear that when he files, if he ever gets around to filing, the 1994 annual return. This is yet another example of how the Labor Party cannot be trusted with money, how it has continually breached the ASC requirements and the Corporations Law and how this branch of the ALP has not just shown bad judgment in losing a fortune in the Sydney property market; it has shown a total disregard for the law. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Better, in fact, than at many other conferences I have been at. I am aware of the statements that Mr Richardson has made, and I can say to the Senate, through you, Mr Deputy President, that they are groundless. I think they are mischievous statements. They are certainly statements that, I believe, are out of step with many of his union colleagues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did publicly announce in a speech I made in Hobart at the ALP national conference that I am currently looking at how plantations can play a role in relieving pressure on native forests while, at the same time, offering significant expansion of the industry's resource base. To this end, I have recently agreed to fund a national plantation study. The study is fully consistent with the national forest policy statement and will involve state and territory conservation councils. I believe it will be significant in progressing the NFPS goals of the full utilisation and expansion of Australia's plantation resource and the NFPS objectives in relation to the development of plantation based industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study will develop an aggregate national overview of the plantation estate, involving the identification of the extent of hardwood and softwood plantations in each state, opportunities for processing this resource, industry expansion opportunities, employment potential and also Commonwealth actions to stimulate an increased emphasis on plantation resource utilisation. It is designed to provide a picture of the extent of the plantation resource nationwide and will identify specific development opportunities which could enjoy the support of both industry and conservation groups. It will also provide the Commonwealth with information on the potential for the ecologically sustainable expansion of industry and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study does differ substantially from the National Plantations Advisory Committee work, which primarily focused on the development and establishment of new plantations on cleared agricultural land. It also differs from the work of the Resource Assessment Commission, which undertook financial feasibility assessments for possible expansion of the plantation estate and studies that detailed the area of land suitable for new plantation development. This study, by contrast, will focus on the extent of existing plantation estate and will examine means to fully utilise that resource. The consultant who is coordinating the study has already had very positive feedback about the study from industry sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study proposal from Environment Victoria entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Plantations: Environment, Industry Development and Employment</EMPHASIS> was first submitted to my department in June of last year. A revised proposal, which was redrafted to fit more directly within the funding guidelines of the environment portfolio, was submitted in February 1994. On 1 April I received that revised study proposal with the recommendation from my department that funding should be granted for the study. I did, however, withhold further action until July, pending receipt of Environment Victoria's audited financial statement for the grants to voluntary conservation organisations program for 1993-94 and until questions raised by Mr Barry Cunningham on the extent of departmental funding to the organisation were answered. I believe this study will provide a basis for greater dialogue on plantation issues between industry, union and conservation interests. I think this is very important to the environment debate in this country.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) As all three tenderers were assessed as being technically competitive and capable of performing the work, cost became a significant determining factor.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also looks to Australian industry to produce major items of equipment for Defence.

Australian and New Zealand firms are treated equally when tendering for Australian defence work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, as clearly stated in the Defence White Paper, a strong Australian defence industry is important in sustaining the operational effectiveness of the Australian Defence Force, and ensuring that the Force is able to adapt to changing circumstances. Industry's contribution to our defence effort will become more important as our strategic environment becomes more demanding. Australia's defence industry capacity is supplemented by New Zealand's. Under the terms of the ANZAC Ship Treaty and in accordance with closer economic and defence relations, New Zealand industry together with Australian industry are considered as a single defence industrial base. Australian and New Zealand firms are therefore treated equally in our Defence industry policies, except in regard to a small number of high-security or third country collaborative projects.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) With one exception, military police have no powers over civilians by virtue of their status as military police. The exception relates to the Defence Force Discipline Act. That Act provides for persons other than members of the Defence Force to be declared to be `Defence civilians', when they accompany a part of the Defence Force outside Australia or on operations against the enemy and have consented in writing to be subject to the Act. A military police officer has certain specific powers in relation to investigation of offences under the Act, meaning that a police officer might have powers exercisable in relation to Defence civilians. There are presently no persons who are `Defence civilians' for the purposes of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In limited circumstances specified in legislation, members of the Defence Force, including military police, do have powers over civilians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, under section 82 of the Defence Act, a member of the Defence Force may arrest a person who is believed on reasonable grounds to have committed an offence against the section, namely trespassing on Defence establishments or photographing or sketching Defence equipment. Under the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act, a `Commonwealth officer' (which term includes a member of the Defence Force) may apprehend a person in the vicinity of a `prohibited area' (an area declared to be prohibited under the Act) and suspected of having committed an offence against the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Although disaster relief is the responsibility of the states and territories, in circumstances where their resources are inadequate to deal with a particular emergency, or they are unable to react with sufficient speed, the Defence Force may assist. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, assistance of this nature may be provided where immediate action is necessary to prevent loss of life or widespread property damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coordination of Defence assistance would normally be facilitated through Defence liaison officers in each capital city and regional commanders in other localities. These officers maintain close contact with state emergency relief authorities and often participate in state emergency exercises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of state disaster preparedness plans would not normally involve Defence directly. However, Defence liaison officers do interact with state coordinators in planning once Defence assistance has been sought. This interaction occurs at both the state and local level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Law enforcement tasks such as dealing with civil unrest are the province of state and territory law enforcement authorities. It is not envisaged that the Defence Force would be used to assist with such tasks except in the most extreme circumstances, and then only after all other alternative means of dealing with the problem had been exhausted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under section 51 of the Defence Act, State Governors may proclaim that domestic violence exists, and may request the Governor-General to call out the Defence Force for the protection of the State against domestic violence. If this has occurred, the Minister may authorise a part of the Defence Force to move to the vicinity of the incident, following which the appropriate civil authority may request a part of the Defence Force to assist in the law enforcement role. In such a case, Defence Force policy requires that those members involved use the minimum force necessary to achieve the purpose. They remain subject to military command, but are also subject to the normal civil law, which is not suspended by reason of the involvement of the Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has no intention to change this policy so as to expand the circumstances in which the Defence Force becomes involved in civil law enforcement tasks.</PARA>
