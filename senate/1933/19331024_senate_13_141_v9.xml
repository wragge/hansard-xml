                        <para>- I rise to a personal explanation. In last night's issue of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> appeared a statement that, as the result of a count of heads by the whips of various parties, a certain result is likely to be obtained when votes are taken in this Senate on the proposal for the restoration of portion of the salary which members of Parliament voluntarily surrendered two years ago in order to help the country through its financial difficulties. As the ministerial whip in the Senate, I am the only person on this side of the chamber to whom the paragraph Call apply. I have not discussed this matter with members of my party, or with the representative of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun,</inline> or any newspaper. I have disclosed no information upon which the newspapers could base a forecast of the result of any vote that may be taken in this chamber. Therefore, the reference to a tally by party whips can be founded only on surmise. It is very unfair on the part of the 'Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun,</inline> or any other journal, to suggest that such a tally has been made. I make this explanation in order that there may be no misunderstanding regarding the votes of honorable senators on this matter. I have not the slightest idea what the voting will be. </para>

                            <para>- In both of the flights referred to by the honorable senator, the pilots were seeking to establish records for the EnglandAustralia passage, which is determined on the time that elapses between departure from any point in England and the arrival at any point in Australia. The selection of either Wyndham or Derby instead of Darwin reduces the total distance, and so favours faster times. In selecting the route for the regular England-Australia air service, however, several important factors other than route distance and flying time between English and Australianshores had to be considered. The selection of Darwin as the port of entry for this service was made only after very careful investigation of the subject, and the Government does not intend to vary the advertised conditions of contract in the manner suggested by the honorable senator. </para>

                        <para>.- This bill, which is designed to give legislative authority to some of the main proposals in the financial policy announced in the Treasurer's budget speech, is almost as objectionable as is the budget itself. No honorable senator will complain that the finances of the country are in such a satisfactory state as a result of the policy followed by the Scullin Administration, that the Government is now able to restore to some sections of the people a proportion of the amounts taken from them two years ago in order to maintain the solvency of the nation, and also to make substantial remissions of taxes to other sections. But there are not wanting those who rightly complain that the Government proposes to make the remissions of taxes to those sections which received, a somewhat similar benefit last year. The remissions authorized last year and those now proposed in this measure, represent a relief from the burden of taxation of approximately £9,500,000 in two years, and show how complete has been the financial rehabilitation of Australia as the outcome of the sound administration of the Scullin Government. The present Government would do well to follow the policy of its predecessor in regard to the rehabilitation of not only" the Commonwealth's finances, but also industry generally, by increasing production and reducing unemployment. In those directions the bill before us fails hopelessly. No assistance is provided in this bill for some sections of the people who are more entitled to such consideration than are many of those to whom it has been extended. Take the wheat farmers, for example. If the Treasury is overflowing with money, surely it is the paramount duty of the Government to give what assistance is necessary to the agricultural and other primary industries upon which the economic welfare of the country so largely depends. Figures have recently been published in the press and elsewhere, showing that those engaged in wheat-growing are in a worse position to-day than ever before in the history of Australia. Last year, the Government made a grant of £2,000,000 to assist them, but this year, although repeated requests have been made for the inclusion of some such provision in this measure, the Government has not yet announced its decision. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Government has been equally remiss in its duty to the unemployed. Who are more entitled to receive consideration at the moment, those who are in a position to pay taxes, and consequently can benefit from the remissions which are to be given, or those who, as a result of being unemployed for perhaps four or five years, have no income, and, consequently, are unable to pay taxes? It is obvious that the Government's first duty is to the unemployed, and, before remitting taxation, it should have devoted a part, at any rate, of the surplus to relieving those now out of work. </para>
                    <para>I also object to the manner in which it is proposed to distribute benefits as between the various States. We, in this Senate, are supposed to be the guardians of State interests, and it i3 our responsibility to see that the burdens and benefits of federation are equally shared. It is distressing, therefore, to observe that little consideration has been shown by the Government to those States, including South Australia, which have been hard hit by drought and depression. Moreover, the Government committed a breach of faith, in spirit at least, in not consulting the States regarding the distribution of the surplus. Had the States not faithfully carried out their obligations under the Premiers plan, the Commonwealth would have had no surplus; therefore when the surplus is to be distributed, they are entitled to be consulted. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed in this bill to make still another remission of federal land tax, bringing the total for two years up to £1,100,000. Last year, approximately £700,000 was remitted, and this year a further £400,000 is to be taken off. It has been claimed by the Prime Minister and other Ministers that these remissions will benefit the primary producers. One would think that the farmers were the only ones who paid federal land tax, and, moreover, that every land-holder in Australia, large or small, came within the scope of the tax. This belief is very widely held, ' due to newspaper propaganda and the statements of Ministers, and I feel that it is my duty to correct that impression. No land-holder with a property of an unimproved value of k-ss than £5,000 will benefit from the remission of this tax. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator's interjection opens up a very wide subject. In the discussion of the tariff, when honorable senators on this side were urging the necessity for building up secondary industries, thus creating a wider home market for Australian primary products, the honorable senator was not so sure of the indirect benefits that would accrue to farmers from the adequate protection of Australian secondary industries. In this case, I repeat that it is doubtful that indirect benefits from this tax remission will be felt by the smaller land-holders and primary producers, though there can be no doubt that the larger land-holders will benefit substantially from this concession, coming, at it does, on top of a remission of £700,000 under legislation passed last year. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>The latest official figures show that 67 per cent, of the land assessed for federal taxation purposes is classified as town lands and 33 per cent, as country lands, so that £67 out of every £100* of this £400,000 remission of land tax will benefit people who own city properties. It is doubtful that the benefit from this concession will be passed on to the people generally. Let us see further how individual land taxpayers will benefit, and also expose the shocking inequality of the Government's propos.il. An individual land-owner with a taxable estate of £500, which means that the unimproved value of his land is £5,500, will have his land tax reduced from £1 5s. Sd. to 19s. 3d. In other words, he will benefit to the extent of 6s. 5d. A land-owner with a taxable property of £1,000, which means, of course, that the unimproved value of his land is £6,000, will have his tax reduced from £2 12s. Sd. to £1 19s. 6d., thus benefiting to the amount of 13s. 2d. When we get up among the larger aggregations of land values, the remissions are much more substantial. For instance, an owner liable to taxation on land valued at £60,000 will have his tax reduced from £195 per annum to £146 5s., a reduction of £48 15s. ; the holder of land valued at £75,000 will have his tax reduced from £937 10s. to £703 2s. 6d., a reduction of £234 7s. 6d.; and the owner of an estate having an unimproved value of £100,000 will have his tax reduced from £1,500 to £1,125, a reduction of £375. Compare these concessions with those conferred on the small land-holder, who, as I have shown, will benefit to the amount of only 6s. 5d. Can we pretend that these remissions of federal land tax will apply equitably to all sections of landholders. Is this legislation which the Senate can pass without amendment? When we further examine the Government's policy in this regard, we find its inequalities even more startling. Last year, as I have already pointed out, it remitted land tax to the amount of £700,000. The present proposal is to reduce by 50 per cent, the rates operating before the reductions made last year. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is entitled to his opinion. I submit that, in view of the state of Commonwealth finances, we cannot afford to abandon this source of revenue. The benefit derived by land-holders from land tax reductions during the last two years totalled £1,100,000 a year. Let us see how the respective land-holders will benefit. A man with taxable estate of a gross unimproved value of £6,000 will benefit to the amount of £1 6s. 4d. from the two remissions made by this Government, and a man with a taxable estate of £55,000 will benefit to the amount of £229 3s. 4d. whereas a man with land having a taxable unimproved value of £100,000 will benefit to the amount of £950. </para>

                            <para>- Of course they do. The Minister's interjection brings me to the point which I was about to make, namely, that the vast sums of money spent by all governments, and particularly by State Governments, in the improvement of the public domain by the building of railways, the carrying out of water conservation schemes, and other public works, is ample justification for the imposition of this tax in order to ensure a return to the community of at least some portion of the heavy expenditure incurred. These various public works have been carried ' out with borrowed money, the bulk of which is still owing, and the interest burden is, as State Auditors-General have pointed out, the principal cause of the difficulties in which State Governments find themselves. The Auditor-General for South Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rogers)</inline> has emphasized this phase of State finance in successive annual reports. Consequently, it follows that there is an. obligation on laud-owners, especially those possessing the larger estates, upon which, obviously, a much greater sum of the unearned  increment has accrued as a result &lt; : this expenditure, to bear some po. lion of the interest burden cast upon the taxpayers of this country. I know that some honorable senators will say that land-owners of a class, and particularly wheat-growers, are in a difficult position, and should be given relief; but I point out that this bill will not relieve small farmers to any appreciable extent, and that even those with comparatively large holdings are amply covered by the hardship sections of the Land Tax Assessment Act, which was liberalized last year. Regarded from every stand-point, the Government's proposal to remit a further sum of £400,000 to land-holders who own the larger estates in this country, is unwarranted. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>Another proposal, the justification for which I am unable to discover, is that to reduce the percentage rate of tax on the gross earnings of overseas shipping companies. This remission will represent about £25,000 per annum. What explanation has been offered for this concession ? In his second-reading speech the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> gave no explanation. He may bc able to furnish in committee some reason for the Government's action, but I doubt this very much. The only possible justification is that it would make possible a reduction of shipping freights on our. surplus exportable products, but having regard to the huge volume of Australian production which is exported, it will be difficult to ensure benefits for individual primary producers by the reduction of shipping freights. I. feel sure that the bulk of the benefits from this reduction of taxation will go into the pockets of shareholders of the companies affected. </para>
                    <para>Another proposal, which, I venture to say, will not benefit the community to any material extent, is the reduction of the rate of the sales tax by 1 per cent., although this will mean a loss of revenue of £1,350,000. Retailers throughout the country have emphasized the difficulty of passing on any benefits from this tax reduction to the  ordinary small shopper, who, because of his or her limited means, is forced to buy,  in very small quantities, commodities which are taxable. It may benefit those who can afford to buy in large quantities, but the small purchaser, who is the most deserving member of the community, can hope for little or no reduction of the cost of living as the result of the sacrifice of this comparatively large amount of revenue. The Government might better have devoted the amount to be remitted to the relief of the wheat-growers and the unemployed. </para>
                    <para>I draw a comparison between the circumstances of those who are to be relieved of taxation under the bill, and those public servants who are to have restored to them a small proportion of the amount which they wore called upon, a couple of years ago, to sacrifice in the interests of national solvency. The land tax was not increased as the result of the financial emergency legislation, but land-owners are to receive a straight-out remission of a tax that was imposed many years ago. When the Financial Emergency Act was passed, a definite statement was made by the Leader of the Government of the day, supported by the Opposition, that as soon as the finances permitted, the wage and pensions cuts would be restored in full. Despite the fact that we have ample justification for that restoration, as is indicated by the Government's proposals for remissions of taxes, the public servant will get only a 2J per cent. restoration, together with the sum of £8 a year which the present Government took from him last year without justification. The invalid and bid-age pensioner will not be given back one penny of the 2s. 6d. a week originally taken from him, but those pensioners who suffered the further cut of 2s. 6d. a week as the result of legislation introduced by the present Government last year are to have that 2s. 6d. restored to them. The Government also imposed very unjust conditions upon the pensioners by introducing legislation under which a. charge was. levied on their properties, so that upon their death, the Commonwealth might recoup itself the amounts paid in pension. So far as I am aware, a similar provision has not been enacted in any other part of the world. It is a direct blow at those  who  have been thrifty, and who, for many years, had denied themselves many comforts so that in- their declining years they might have a home of their own. Old folk are often assisted by members  of  their families to secure a residence; and just as the old homes of the aristocracy in Great Britain were handed down from one generation to another, these old folks are anxious that their homes shall pass into the possession of their children. They are deeply attached to their homes, and many of them have cancelled their pensions, and decided to fend for themselves, rather than encumber their properties. This iniquitous provision should have been repealed by the present 'bill. It will encourage persons to dispose of their property long before reaching the age at which they will be entitled to the pension. </para>

Since we are dealing with a financial measure, I submit that the amendment should take the form of a request to the House of Representatives that certain action be taken. One objection to the amendment is that it violates the Constitution. It would add a burden on the taxpayers which it is not competent for this Senate to  impose. Discussionhas arisen in this chamber on many occasions as to the form which amendments to financial measures shall take, and I submit that the amendment should comply with the practice adopted in the Senate in the past. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall not cast a silent vote on this measure because of the controversy which has taken place in the press over the week-end. I propose to vote to allow the bill to pass its second reading; but in committee I shall assist the Opposition to amend it. I believe that the action taken in another place was in order, and that in any restoration scheme members of Parliament, in common with other sections of the community, are entitled to have restored to them a portion of the amount which previously they sacrificed. It is all very well for persons with no experience of parliamentary life to question parliamentary expenditure. Their point of view is largely the result of the actions and statements of some members of Parliament, who, in private conversation, admit that they cannot pay their way on their allowance, but will not vote to restore a portion of the amount by which it was re-  duced.  One member of another place admitted to me this morning that he had voted against the proposal to increase the present allowance to members, although he himself could not live on it. If he could not balance his own budget, was it not right, provided the expenditure had been legitimate, to let Parliament know exactly the difficulty in which. he was placed ? As a matter of fact, this member has a private income, and is able to make up the deficiency in his parliamentary allowance out of his own private means. I know of no member of this Parliament who can live in affluence on the present parliamentary allowance. I admit that there are men on the bank of the Torrens River, in South Australia, and in the capital cities of all the States, who are existing below the bread line. I admit that they are making a great sacrifice, of which we should like to relieve them, but that is not a reason why we should fill this and another chamber with poorly-fed .and poorly-clothed men. It is no reason why we should offer as an inducement to men to control the destinies of a nation in a time of crisis, a salary very much lower than that which was offered to them during normal times. When a business is passing through a time of crisis, the chief concern of its directors should be to secure a maximum of efficiency in all departments. Certain honorable members - most of them, I think, with their tongues in their cheeks - tell us that the best way in which we can get through our present  difficulties  is to make a gesture to the people: "Do not let them think, " they say, " that we are moving in the direction of increasing our salaries while things are so bad. " Unfortunately, that way of looking at things has recently found favour with those in control of some political movements, among them the movement to which1 1 owed my election to this Senate. It is the same movement as drove me out of the Labour party when I supported the Scullin Government in making the cuts a few years ago, and now it threatens to drive out of the movement those who take. any step to restore the cuts which were then made. Could there possibly be any stronger indictment of the principle of control of politicians by party movements ? We believe, as Labour representatives, that there should never have been any cut, but on that issue the party was rent asunder. The first section to break away was that which is now led in this chamber to-day by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn.</inline> Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> and I were excluded from the movement because we supported the cut. Presumably, if I were now back where I was then, I should be turned out of the movement for proposing to restore the cut. </para>

                    <para>I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> that better provision should have been made in this bill for the pensioners.. While I deplore the fact that the Commonwealth ignored the States when deciding how to distribute the surplus, now that the task is before us, I believe that the pensioners should receive greater consideration. The full restoration of pensions would have been a decent gesture on the part of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. If we are to make gestures, let us make those that mean something to the people; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran's</inline> amendment has been lost, and a wonderful opportunity for making an honest gesture has been allowed to pass. The same thing applies to Public Service salaries. I regret that we are perpetuating a system which is entirely inconsistent with the policy which nearly every member of the Commonwealth Parliament professes to support, namely, the policy of arbitration. At a time of emergency, we justified our decision to make arbitrary cuts of wages, and to ignore arbitration, by saying that the state of the country demanded it. To-day, we are told that the nation has turned the corner. The Treasurer has £7,000,000 at his disposal ; yet we propose still to ignore the principle of industrial arbitration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran's</inline> amendment should have been carried, and the Government should have so recast this legislation as to restore to the workers the protection of arbitration. I shall vote for the second reading of the bill, and I hope that in committee we shall be able to increase the old-age and invalid pensions* I hope that better counsels will eventually prevail, and that more generous treatment will be given to those sections of the community which really need it. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran's</inline> amendment to provide for the restoration of pensions and salary cuts has been defeated. I was amused to note the vacillating attitude of certain honorable members who, after supporting the meagre restoration of salaries and pensions provided for in this bill, went squealing to the Sydney press during the week-end regarding the grievances of pensioners and public servants. Some honorable members seem to be inordinately fond of publicity. All politicians, we know, are richly endowed with egotism, and this, perhaps, accounts for their desire to see their statements in print. In the whole course of British parliamentary history I know of, only one man who had anything to do with Parliament of whom this could not be said, and that man was Guy Fawkes, who wanted to blow up the whole outfit. It is evident that there are a few modern prototypes of Guy Fawkes in Canberra, men who rush to the newspapers to put their own side of the case, even at the expense of their colleagues. </para>

                    <para>Much has been said in this chamber, and in another place, regarding the economic rehabilitation. of Australia. In 1931, when the emergency legislation was introduced by the Scullin Government, the public were asked to make sacrifices to the amount of £11,000,000. Now, some of the responsible persons associated with the Government which brought in that legislation, are expressing voluble dissent from the recent reduction of the basic wage in New South Wales. Not only were the public servants in that State made to bear a salary reduction of 12-A per cent., but workers outside the Service were, on the motion of the employers in the Arbitration Court, made to suffer a reduction of their wages by 10 per cent. Now, honorable members in the Federal Parliament have restored £75 a ye:'r of their own allowances, so that I presume the employers will approach the  court-  since the precedent has been established - with a proposal to restore to the workers that which was previously taken from them. It is only three years ago since the Associated Press of New South Wales forced its employees to accept a 10 per cent, reduction of their salaries. When the executive of the Australian Journalists Association showed signs of fighting against the threatened cut, the directors of Associated Newspapers told their wage plugs and press slaves that if, through their organization, they sought to prevent the reduction  from being made, they would cease the publication of a number of subsidiary newspapers in Sydney, thus throwing out of employment a large number of journalists, as well as employees in other departments of the newspaper business. </para>

                            <para>- I contend that my criticism of Associated Newspapers ia definitely in order, because, within the last few days, there have appeared in the newspapers controlled by it strong criticisms of the proposed increase of ministerial and parliamentary allowances, and I am endeavouring to show that the directorate of that company, at all events, is not above criticism. Being a politician, I am not thin-skinned. The press of this country can " belt " me as much as it likes. I have nothing to be ashamed of, either as a politician or as a private citizen. As a member of this Parliament I am on the grid-iron of public opinion for practically 24 hours daily. Recently I was under fire by the press of New South Wales in regard to another matter. I wonder if some of the directors of Associated Newspapers could come out of a similar ordeal with such a satisfactory record, especially <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Fordyce  Wheeler, a director of Associated Newspapers and a wife snatcher. He is the last man who should criticize any politician of this country or say anything about raiding the Treasury during the midnight hours of a parliamentary session in Canberra. Such criticism as this comes well from a wife snatcher - a man who has smashed a home and ruined the prospects of four children. </para>

                            <para>- I am replying to attacks that were made on all members of Parliament by. the " dingo " directors of Associated Newspapers of Sydney. Is that clear enough? This recent criticism is, of course, intended to cover up their propaganda of the last two years for the purpose of making possible further cuts in the basic wage. Not so long ago workmen on the basic wage had their pay cut to the amount of 14s. 6d. a week by the State Government, which owed its accession to power to the associated press of that State. Of course, these men, the greatest crowd of commercial " gogetters " and press prostitutes seen in the history of this country, can do no wrong! </para>

                            <para>- I have the greatest contempt for these men who water their stool's and rob people right and left. The daily newspaper is a unit in the everyday life of the community, but in the course of its development the Sydney press, as represented by Associated Newspapers, has not been a paragon of purity or a monument of integrity. It- can ill -afford to point the finger of scorn at members of this Parliament and make veiled references to "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves," who, according to the story, were to be destroyed by pouring hot oil into the jars in which they were concealed. Nothing less powerful than dynamite would dislodge all the thieves connected with Associated Newspapers, and drive them out of their " funk " hole, stink hole, and rat hole under the golden ball in Elizabeth-street. Comrade <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hugh</inline> Denison, this Knight of the British Empire, this man. who, once every twelve months, swings his belly in the breeze in Martin-place and talks about his patriotism, suggests that all connected with the party to which I belong are Communists or near Communists. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> would have been well-advised to reply to questions which I put to him this afternoon, with reference to the desirability of appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamb,</inline> K.C., who <inline font-style="italic">ii</inline> making inquiries into petrol prices in Australia,, a royal commissioner to inquire into the activities of the Associated Newspapers of New .South Wales. If this were done, we should, perhaps, obtain some interesting information as to the ramifications of these interests and learn something of the condition of many hundreds of persons who, formerly, were engaged in the newspaper industry in Sydney, but to-day are living on the dole in that city, or walking the roads of New South Wales. I suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wheeler</inline> and his girl friend will have a very nice little dinner to-night. But what about the wives and children of these unemployed press people ? They will not be in that happy position. Comrade Denison has attacked the politicians in this Parliament. I am ready at all times to defend anything which I may do here. I think I have said all that I had set out to say with regard to Comrade Wheeler and Comrade Denison, the Mutt and Jeff of the Elizabeth-street " funk " hole. They talk about politicians diving into the public purse! They are not above accepting the remissions of land  tax, sales tax and primage duty, -which this Government is making to them. Nor have they said anything about the " rakeoff " which they got when they increased the price of their newspapers from Id. to l|d. Of course, they did not consult Parliament, the people, or the Sydney Trades Hall before they made that move. All they did was to meet in that little secret room in Elizabeth-street under the golden ball, and resolve that, in future, if the wage plugs of New South Wales wanted a newspaper, they would have to pay l£d. for it. Thus, at one stroke, they increased by 50 per cent, the price of newspapers to the people in that State. There was no one to check their actions or to ask for the publication of the official minutes or to inquire into this midnight plot, so that the people would know who moved and who supported the resolution to cut clown their employees' wages by 10 per cent. These newspaper directors are concerned only with profits. They have no regard for the welfare of the kiddies who sell their newspapers in the streets, and who, sometimes, in the rush to earn ,a few pence in commission on sales, get crushed beneath the wheels of Sydney  tramcars.  Their one concern is to sell newspapers. </para>

Nevertheless, we have fought constantly in the interests of the pensioners and the public servants. I notice that a big squeal has come from some of the public servants in Canberra on the ground that they are not receiving justice from the present Government. It is true that hundreds of public servants in Canberra should have fully restored to them the cuts in their wages and salaries as was proposed in the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> ; but I cannot overlook the fact that a number of them became members of a government " basher " gang when the Lang administration was in power in New South Wales, and an SOS was sent out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> intended to despatch an army to Canberra. Those public servants rushed forward to form themselves into a basher gang, and batons were issued to them. I suppose that they will have to receive an increase of their salaries, if the lower-paid public servants in Canberra benefit under this measure. A precedent has been set in the House of Representatives for a general restoration of public servants' wages and salaries throughout Australia, and the sooner action is taken in that direction the better it will be for everybody. Yet, when the Lang Government was in power, the associated press of New South Wales preached day in and day out that that Ministry should be smashed. That press is still. squealing under the golden ball in Castlereagh Street, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and I will continue to fight for full restoration to the pensioners and the public servants, and for decent conditions for industrial workers and farmers. Although farmers in New South Wales and in other States "have their crops and holdings heavily encumbered, they got no measure of assistance from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Badman</inline> when I took action on their behalf in this chamber a few days ago. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Badman</inline> is not present to hear what I have to say regarding him. Like every other citizen, he is entitled to express his opinions, and when he was interviewed last Saturday by the associated newspapers, he had a good deal to say in criticism of the Government because of the proposed increase of the parliamentary allowances. Also, he condemned the Government freely on my motion for the adjournment of the Senate as an instruction to the Ministry to arrange for 3s. a bushel to be paid to the wheat-growers; but, when the bells were rung, and the Government could have been defeated, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Badman</inline> voted with the Ministry. I like the  Chairman  of Committees, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays personally, but I dislike him politically. He went to Sydney on Saturday, and, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Badman,</inline> stretched his tonsils by condemning the action taken in the House of Representatives to increase the parliamentary allowance; but why was he not fair enough to tell the people of New South Wales that he was receiving an extra £500 a year as  Chairman  of Committees in this chamber? The honorable senator is an honest man, no doubt, but if his criticism was sincere, he should have brought out the skeleton, and allowed the bones to rattle properly, so that all might hear them. </para><para>

I tried to communicate with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy,</inline> in order to enlist his assistance in the interests of the wheat farmers, but I was disappointed. I made a trunk telephone call to Wagga for the purpose of speaking to the " Cromwell of the Riverina ", and was informed by a member of his office staff that he had left for Tocumwal to speak that night at a meeting. I then rang up Tocumwal, and through a stock and station agent named Tuck, I sent an appeal to Comrade Hardy to hasten back to Canberra to give a vote which would assist, in defeating the Government on the issue that I had raised regarding wheat. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> did not reply; but he could go to the press am i talk about the Tammany methods followed in the other branch of this legislature. I should say that the honorable senator was elected to this chamber, not by Tammany, but by Rafferty rules. When it was decided by the Country party in New South Wales to run a candidate for the Senate, " Cromwell " Hardy was put in the team with Senators Cox and Massy-Greene, and those who now talk about Tammany methods " ditched " cx-Senator Walter Duncan in the process.

                        <para>. -  It is not easy to discuss this bill without first having had a general discussion on the budget, because the measure before us seeks to give legislative effect to important features of the Government's financial policy. It is impossible to deal properly with this bill without taking into consideration a great many factors which do not appear in it at all. For instance, there is no provision in the hill to give effect to the Government's proposals in relation to remissions of income taxation, and there is no mention of primage and exchange. It contains no reference to any alterations of indirect taxation, or, indeed, to finance generally. I have no desire to open up a general discussion of the budget - indeed if I were to attempt to do so, I should probably be ruled out of order - but in considering the principles of this important measure, the general position of Australia, and of the world at large, must be taken into account. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I draw special attention to the absence of any provision, first, for any payment in respect of Australia's war debt to Great Britain, and secondly, for any payment to the States apart from the amounts promised to them at the conference of Premiers held in Melbourne some months ago. The Commonwealth Grants Commission will, I presume, submit a report during the current financial year, yet the budget contains no provision for the  policy that may be recommended although a considerable sum may be involved. Thirdly, I draw attention to the absence of any provision for payment to the wheat-farmers. He would be a bold man who, in view of the present position of the wheat industry, would declare that the growers of Australia will be able to carry on throughout the year without any assistance from the Commonwealth. These are important omissions from the budget speech. </para>
                    <para>Important though the restoration of pensions, and of allowances to members of Parliament may be, the bill does not deal with those subjects alone. Speaking in the briefest and the most general terms, I assume that the Government's objectives in the shaping of its policy were the revival of trade and the employment of the people. With those objects all will cordially agree, but we must be careful not to go too fast when making reductions. </para>

                        correctly said that two thirds of the amount represented by the reduction of land tax would go to the holders of city properties, and the remaining one-third to the man on the land. Apparently, ho is of the opinion that the Government's object is to assist certain wealthy individuals in the community.

                            <para>- Some of these supposedly wealthy individuals are not particularly well off at present. It may be that the Government has decided to remit land tax because it realizes that this tax is a capital levy, which has to be paid whether or not the land-owner is making any profits. Honorable senators will agree that it is grossly unfair to continue to tax heavily, a man who is making a loss every year. I do not like the " hardship " provisions of the Land Tax Act, because their effect, is that while the effective and the efficient are taxed the ineffective and the inefficient are allowed to escape. The Government's main purpose was not, I imagine, the abolition of an unfair capital levy, but rather the easing of the burden of taxation so that men could trade more, produce more, and offer more employment. From whatever point of view we regard it, the decision to remit land tax is a wise one. </para>

                    <para>I pass from these general remarks to deal with a number of proposed increases of expenditure. In their order of merit, as I view them, they are: First, war pensions; secondly, Public Service salaries and wages; thirdly, parliamentary allowances; and 'fourthly, old-age pensions. T am particularly pleased that war pensions to 57,698 widows are to be increased slightly. The total cost of the concession is estimated at ?1.36,000 per annum, or about ?2 each, which is not a large additional sum to pay to the widow of a soldier. </para>
                    <para>In South Australia,- there has been, a good deal of criticism recently regarding the proposal to increase the wages and salaries of 'Commonwealth public servants when the remuneration of State employees is being reduced. As a matter of fact, in my own State at the present time the vote for education is even being still further reduced. In the official report of the last conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held in Melbourne in June, particulars are given on page 28 of reductions of salaries and wages during the period 1932-33. It gives the percentage reduction compared with the rates in force in 1929-30, and covers Public Services proper, and also police and school teachers. If we are to consider what restorations are proper, it is only right that we  should  take into account what reductions have been made. The average reduction in the Commonwealth Service since 1929-30 is 21.9 per cent. In New South Wales the reduction is even greater, namely, 23.4 per cent. Reductions in the other States are: - Victoria, 17 per cent.; Queensland, 15.2 per cent.; South Australia, 19 per cent.; Western Australia, 19.2 per cent., and Tasmania, 20 per cent. A study of the figures given here, together with those relating to taxation, show pretty clearly that Queensland has in part been getting out of its difficulties, not by reducing its expenditure, but by increasing its taxation. In Queensland, taxation has been higher than in any other State of the Commonwealth, with the exception of New South Wales, and this year even that exception has 'been removed. Queensland has not cut down its expenditure adequately, but has increased its taxation, and I do not regard that as a proper fulfilment of the Premiers plan. </para>

                            <para>- I have introduced this aside in order to draw a few interjections from my Queensland friends. I shall be pleased if they can refute what I have said, and can show that Queensland really has carried out its undertaking. It appears to me that since salaries have been reduced to a greater extent in the Commonwealth Service than in any other, except that of New South Wales, it is only reasonable that Commonwealth public servants should have their salaries restored to a parity with those in the States. AVe all admit that the public servants perform a valuable work,' the quality of which, of coui-.se, varies, and that the Commonwealth owes some consideration to them. I. hope, however, that the Common wealth public servants will not press their claims - their rights, if you like - too far. I imagine that the Government has tried to keep as many of its servants employed as possible during these difficult times, probably more than are really needed to do the work. If the public servants insist on getting back 100 per cent, of the cut, the inevitable result must be that the services of many of them will be dispensed with. I hope that this will not occur, because I believe that the Government during a time of such great depression should employ as many as possible at a lower wage, rather than a smaller number at a high wage. </para>

                    <para>I now come to parliamentary allowances, the proposed increase of which will involve approximately £10,000. It is interesting to note what is paid to parliamentary representatives in other parts of the world. In Great Britain members of the House of Lords receive no payment at all, and never have received, any. It may be useful, even in a thoroughgoing democracy like ours, to know that England has never lacked public men to do its public work without fee or reward. Members of the House of Commons are paid £400 a year, and I do not think that they are over-paid. I suppose it might be argued that the ordinary members of the House of Commons are as much in need of an increase as are we in this Parliament, our allowance being double theirs. In the United States of America, senators and members of Congress receive 10,000 dollars a year, which is equivalent to between £2,000 and £2,500 a year, according to the rate of exchange. They also receive certain travelling allowances. Therefore, whilst members in Great Britain receive only half what we do, congressmen in the United States of America receive more than twice as much. My attitude in regard to. the increase of parliamentary allowances is governed, first, by the promise I made to my constituents. I shall vote against the clauses providing for the increase, because I promised my constituents that I should do so. Beyond that, 1. do not consider that the general economic and political state of the world, at this time, justifies us in increasing our allowances, and I am doubtful whether we are justified in granting even, some other forms of relief which it is proposed to grant. I am certain that we are not justified in increasing old-age and invalid pensions at this time. We have only to look around us to see that the condition of the United States of America, at any rate, is one of extreme doubt, and that of Europe is hardly any better. No on-' can say that our own situation, in regard to the wheat industry, is a happy  oneWith  all the distress around us due !o unemployment and reduced incomes, we are not warranted, in my judgment, in raising parliamentary salaries. I agree that members of Parliament have many calls upon them, but we must remember that we are still in receipt of considerable allowances. I do not believe, as some honorable members do, in lopping the tall poppies, but neither do I believe that, at the present time, we are justified in giving ourselves a greater increase than we aro able to give those persons in our service who are much worse off than we are. I do not speak so much about unemployment as do some honorable members, -but can we fairly vote to ourselves, as a body, £10,000, when multitudes of people in Australia are out of work and in actual distress? I cannot see that this proposed action is on any account permissible; I am certain that it is not judicious. This proposal is not really a Government matter. It was not mentioned in the budget and was only inserted in this bill at the eleventh hour. It is at least arguable that its presence in the bill now is due as much to the action of private members as to the desire of the Government. It is perfectly obvious that this move will bring parliamentary institution into disrepute, whether deservedly or not. It is being attacked by every newspaper of any standing throughout the Commonwealth. I do not, say that newspaper opinion is necessarily right, but, insofar as it reflects public opinion, it is deserving of consideration. Organizations of taxpayers and graziers, as well as trade union secretaries and others prominent in the commercial and industrial world, have expressed the view that this move is not justified, particularly in view of the fact that it was made almost at the very last moment of the dis- cussion of this bill in the House of Representatives. I therefore urge that, as it was not a Government proposal, Ministers should not seek to have it carried in the Senate with the assistance of Labour senators, and against the votes of its own supporters, as was the case so frequently during the debate on the tariff. I ask the Government to consider whether the clauses dealing with the ministerial and parliamentary allowances should not be postponed until a more suitable occasion, so that in the meantime the whole proposal can be fully discussed and the  public  mind educated to the financial needs of members of this Parliament. There is distrust of this move. This distrust, whether or not it is deserved, will recoil, not only on those who vote for this new provision, but on the entire parliamentary system, at a time when it is most desirable that the system should be strengthened, and not weakened. The Government could now quite well withdraw the clauses dealing with this matter. </para>

                    <para class="block">A pension of 17s. 6d. has now the purchasing power of 23s. 9d. in 1925. The real value of the pension is, I suppose, higher than it has ever been. This, surely, is conclusive evidence that an increased payment to a section of the people to which the Government is not committed in the way that it is to the recipients of war pensions, and its employees, is not warranted. The country, as the Prime Minister said last year, simply cannot afford to pay this amount. Two years ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin,</inline> the leader of a Labour Government, declared that unless he had agreed to the Premiers plan, he would not have been able to pay pensioners more than 12s. out of the Treasury. Yet this Government, by the latest increase, is giving to pensioners the equivalent of 23s. 9d., or nearly double the amount mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin.</inline> Its real value is higher  than pensions paid in any part of the world, and I submit that it is more than this country can afford, while hundreds of thousands of people find it impossible to balance their individual budgets. A fair thing is a fair thing. What I am saying will, I know, be taken up by other honorable senators, but I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> who will, perhaps, not give me a fair answer, what is the limit for a pension? Is it 17s. 6d. ? Or would he make it £2 10s. ? Whenever I have been discussing this subject at public meetings, I have sometimes addressed a similar question to those of my hearers, who, obviously, were advocates of higher and still higher pension .payments, and, as a rule, I have had to be satisfied with replies couched in general terms. The real test of whether our pension system is fair is the measure of assistance given in other countries in substantially the same position as Australia. I hope that what I have said on this subject will at least promote a certain amount of discussion and, therefore, serve a useful purpose. </para>

                        <para>. - I rise with apologies to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll,</inline> who, in a statement made some days ago, expressed a great deal of personal discomfort at having to be a member of a chamber which contained <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> who, he said, was the human equivalent of the American aloe, which blossoms once in a hundred years. I regret that he should be distressed at having to live temporarily, at all events, alongside such an unusual and exotic product. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> put a question to me, and then was ungentlemanly enough to suggest that I would not answer it fairly. That was unworthy of the honorable senator. I intend to ask a question of him, but I shall not suggest that he will not answer it fairly because he supplied the answer in his speech a few minutes ago. My question to him is: - "Would he like his aged father or mother to be living on the miserable pittance which to-day constitutes the old-age pension?" Let him answer that ! I answer the question which he put to me by saying that there is no limit to the wealth which we can jointly create, and there is no part of the world where wealth can be created so inimitably as in Australia. There is no difficulty whatever in providing an unending surplus for foreign exchange. There is at our disposal ample power over nature to gratify fully every need, for the complete training and education of every faculty, and for the most exquisite enjoyment of every artistic delight. What competitive individualism and capitalist anarchy have been wholly unable to accomplish, is easily possible under a well ordered system of democratic collectivism. </para>

                    <para>I say in answer to the question put to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes,</inline> that if I had my way, and I believe Australia could easily accomplish it, the Commonwealth Government would bring in a national insurance scheme to provide complete insurance for all the people of the Commonwealth against old age, invalidity, accident, disease, and loss of ability, and in every way ensure that all persons in the Commonwealth, who had borne their full responsibility as citizens in the production and distribution of the wealth of this country, would be insured for all time against any form of disability. I am grieved and astounded to notice the ease and calm with which honorable senators opposite, and particularly the honorable senator who has just resumed his seat, and who is well-known to be financially independent, say that it would be unwise to improve the lot of the old-age pensioners. Those honorable senators, however, must bear the responsibility' for their opinions ; I am exceedingly grateful that I do not have to bear it. I regret that the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> was not agreed to ; it did not receive even a semblance of intelligent consideration from the Government and its supporters. I shall vote for the bill, because I accept the assurance of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> that the finances are.,in such a condition that the Government can afford to distribute largess, but I shall take serious objection later to the proposed method of distribution. I have always considered that a government is guilty of an immoral act if it has a surplus, because a surplus shows that the Government has taken from the pockets of the people taxes that it should not have collected, or that it has underpaid its servants or starved its services. A private commercial undertaking is conducted for the express purpose of making profits, but the object of a government should be not to make profits but to render service to the people. A ministry is simply an executive for the purpose of carrying on the affairs of the public, and its budget is merely an account of its stewardship during the year. It should give so much service to the people that profit is impossible. I strongly object to any remission of land tax- </para>

                            <para>- I cannot agree to the remission of this tax to any landholder, irrespective of the size of his holding. Land, air and water should not be privately owned, because they are gifts of the Creator to all mankind, and not to any particular section. . A sane policy would be to obtain all necessary revenue by means of a tax on land. Useful land is limited in area, and once the people are prevented from access to it, they are deprived of the means by which they live. The Government has certainly not taken, by way of taxation, so much money as it should from the owners of land. Only a few individuals contribute the greater part of the money collected in land tax, and they certainly are not the small farmers. Practically the only land-owners who pay this tax, in Queensland at any rate, are big companies. The objection to it comes mostly from the press and other vested interests. No matter how biased an honorable senator may be, it must be obvious to him that the land in Australia was of no value in it's virgin state, except to the aborigines, who derived their living from it. It acquired a value as man began to wrest from nature her wonderful products, and to apply to industry the results of scientific investigation. As the population grew, and the needs of the people increased, the land assumed a value which it otherwise would not have had. The community needed railways, water-ways and other services, and it was found necessary to impose land and other taxes to raise the money required to pay for them. The whole community provided the facilities which increased the value of the public estate, and, therefore, that estate should have been retained for the benefit of the public. Not one foot of it should have been alienated in feesimple thereby enabling private individuals to gain the unearned increment. There cannot, in any circumstances, be a clear title to land, because no legal title can be given to that which has been stolen, no matter how many times it changes hands. </para>

                            <para>- It would be difficult to discover the rightful owner. In my youth I read a story concerning a man who, when crossing a field belonging to a lord, was accosted by the lord's gamekeeper and asked if he knew on whose property he was trespassing. The man replied that, although the land was supposed to belong to Lord so-and-so, he was not its rightful owner, because, on the gamekeeper's own showing, it had passed through many hands and the first alleged owner had claimed that he had fought "William the Conqueror for it. He concluded, " and I intend to fight your boss for it". There is no rightful owner of any land as against the community. </para>

                    <para>The proposed remissions of land tax have been cunningly and scientifically devised with a view to handing out largess to the already wealthy friends of the Government. A man who holds land of an unimproved taxable value of £500 will, under the Government's proposal, benefit only to the amount of 19s. 3d. a year. Another, with land of an unimproved value of £1,000, will gain £1 19s. 6d. a year - sufficient to buy a Christmas present. But a man with property of an unimproved value of £20,000, will receive from this beneficent Government £77 10s. a year - sufficient to provide a second-class return fare to the Old Country. The Jowetts of the community, the unimproved value of whose property is £100,000 or more, will be better off to the amoun't of about £400 a year. These people, having provided the election funds, of the party now in office, naturally call the tune to which the Government dances. Instead of granting these remissions to its wealthy friends, the Government should have distributed among the old-age pensioners any funds available for disbursement. </para>

                        said that Australia cannot afford to restore the old-age pension to the amount at which it stood before it was reduced under the pressure of a great emergency. He doubts whether Australia can carry on, even with the pension limited to the amount at which it stands to-day. Yet the latest figures supplied by the secretariat of the League of Nations show that the nations of the world spend on armaments at least £900,000,000 per annum, on the basis of the value of the £1 sterling before Great Britain departed from the gold standard. The world can spend more than £2,000,000 a day on armaments, yet this National Parliament of Australia hesitates to restore to £1 a week the pension payable to the aged and infirm in our midst.

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> seems determined not to let me forget that a Labour Government was the first to reduce the old-age pension. But the honorable senator fails to tell the Senate, or those to whom he looks for votes, that the Scullin Government reduced the pension to 17s. 6d. a week only because the banks had said that if that were not done the Government would not be able to pay more than 12s. in the £1 after the 1st July next ensuing. Rather than reduce the old-age pension to 12s. the Scullin Government decided to make it 17s. Gd. a week, and to call on the rest of the community to make up the difference. That Government believed in equality of sacrifice, so far as it was possible to obtain it. So long as I am in this chamber, and in full possession of my voice, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will not get away with such statements. Indeed, I shall follow him and his colleagues  through the country, particularly in Queensland, and denounce them for the political frauds and impostors that they are. For the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> I quote a passage I have read - " There is the patriot who waves a flag, hut' a greater patriot is he who blushes every time he sees a neglected child." We on this side of the chamber say that the Government should not, have handed out largess to its friends, while there was a neglected child, a necessitous pensioner, or an underpaid and over-worked public servant in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I now pass on to another matter which seems to have greatly disturbed honorable senators, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes.</inline> This is the proposal to restore to members of Parliament part of the reduction in their parliamentary allowances which was made during the financial emergency, when conditions were very different from what they are to-day. I have no compunction whatever in declaring myself to be entirely opposed at all times to the reduction of wages and salaries, and, therefore, by parity of reasoning, to be at all times in favour of increasing them. When I first entered this Senate, I expressed my opinion quite clearly on the reduction of parliamentary allowances which had then recently been made. When the Labour party in Queensland called for nominations from those willing to contest a seat in the Senate, the salary was ?1,000 a year, little enough in all conscience for those called upon to make and administer the laws of the Commonwealth. A considerable time elapsed between the calling of nominations and the election, and, in the interval, parliamentary ' allowances were cut fro:n ?1,000 to ?800 a year. I was elected when the allowance stood at ?S00, and for two months I was paid at that rate. Then, without any reference to me, or to my party, the allowance was reduced by ?50. Speaking in the Senate mi the 28th September, 1.932, I said - </para>

                        <para>T intend to oppose the reduction in parliamentary allowances with all the energy that I can command. Of course, the axe is going to fall; I a.ni not worrying about that.

During the short time I have been a member of this chamber, I have realized that it is becoming less and less a place in which the working class will be able to secure representation ; it is becoming more and more a social club, the members of which will consist largely of those who are able to retire, and to whom their parliamentary allowance is of little moment. Membership of this chamber suits those who attach special value to social prestige, but it is becoming increasingly difficult for the representatives of the working class to become members of this Parliament, and to maintain themselves in Canberra solely on their parliamentary allowance. I protest against the reduction of that allowance, because 1 contend that the highest chamber in the National Parliament of the Commonwealth should be open to the poorest individual in the community, and that the allowance should be sufficient to enable men to remain here and do their job even if they have no other source of remuneration. I believe that the most sacred work individuals in this enlightened democracy can be called upon to undertake is to make laws under which people have to live. </para>

                    <para class="block">What is the difficulty which honorable members experience in accepting this slight restoration of what they have given up? The trouble is that the press of Australia has seized on this proposal to raise a. scare. I have never been under any misapprehension, since I have been able to think at all, regarding the troubles which afflict humanity, regarding the vicious influence exercised by the newspaper press of the Commonwealth. Almost without exception, every journal is prostituted to the service of Mammon. It is impossible for the newspapers to deal impartially with any man who attacks the citadel of wealth and vested interests. I have never had any illusions on this subject. As honorable senators know, it is usual for a man elected to Parliament to return thanks to the electors, and to those who have assisted him. On the occasion of my election, I said that, to the press and those who had tried to prevent my election, I had no thanks to offer, and that if ever the time came when the Nationalist press of Australia had a kind word to say of me as a politician or a citizen, I should feel it necessary to examine my conscience in order to see what had gone wrong with me. I am not concerned with the opinion of the press on this matter except to say this: the press of Australia cannot at any time be accepted as the mouthpiece of real public opinion. Those who control the press sell their journalistic souls in the worship of the golden calf, and never by any chance do they depart from the course laid down for them. Yet these people are receiving charity from this and every other Government in the Commonwealth. They are receiving concessions from the Commonwealth alone estimated at £500,000 a year. It is they who will benefit as much as any one else from the remission of the land tax, because they own city land valued at thousands of pounds a foot. They have also been granted remissions of income tax, while the sales tax on the products they use has been reduced. These are the people who, during the war, in the nation's hour of crisis, raised the price of newspapers by 50 per cent., and have since declined to reduce that price, even though the country has been passing through a terrible economic depression. These are the people who receive concessions in the shape of special newspaper trains and low freight rates, besides the remission of duty on newsprint. They receive the use of the telephone service at reduced rates, and have special dictaphone services provided for their benefit. Yet they have the effrontery to talk about Tammany methods, and to heap ridicule and opprobrium on members of this Parliament when they seek to restore part of what they gave up during "the country's time of stress. This is not a party matter; no one can say that it is the proposal of the Labour party, or the Lang party, or the Country party, or the Government party. As a national policy, 1 believe it is right to increase wages and salaries to a proper level. I believe that we are conferring "a benefit on the community by moving now for this partial restoration of the cut. It is this action which has given the lead to the Government of New South Wales in questioning the recent infamous, cruel and cowardly cut of the basic wage in that State, and which has encouraged the captains of industry, and the big emporiums in Sydney, to refuse to give effect to that cut. Henry Ford said at the beginning of the crisis in the United States of America that there was no way out of the difficulties with which they were surrounded but by increasing wages and reducing the number of working hours. The same is true of Australia, and we should set a good example. The hands of honorable senators on this side are clean, because we have asked that, before this largess is distributed, the salaries of public servants be restored to their old level, and that pensions be increased. It is an iniquitous thing that we 'who have to legislate for the Commonwealth should receive allowances which are only one-fifth of the salaries paid to some public servants whom we ourselves appoint. I told .(the people.in my State that I was opposed to the ' reduction of parliamentary allowances, because I knew that they had been reduced only that the pensioners and the lower-paid public servants might the more easily be reconciled to the cuts to which they had been subjected. Of course, I know how much more than the basic wage is the salary I am now receiving; but members of the Labour party stand not for more people on lower wages, but for more people on higher wages. We have proved our bona fides by asking the Government not to make any remissions of any kind whatever until the pensioners and public servants have had restored to them what they lost. Before entering this Parliament, I was paid £600 a year, and, if away from my home, £1 a day travelling allowance, as the State organizer for the Australian Labour party. After I entered Parliament, my parliamentary allowance of £800 was cut to £750, and I receive no travelling allowance. If a man is prepared to loaf on the job, I suppose the allowance is worth having, but if he is prepared to work at it as he should, if he is' prepared to make it a full-time job as he should, if he accepts the position at all, then the salary is not commensurate with the work and the responsibility. In addition to performing our parliamentary duties here, for which we are ridiculously underpaid, we are carrying the propaganda of our party into all parts of the country. Recently I conducted a tour of the south-western portion of Queensland, the expenses of which I gladly paid out of my own pocket. Honorable senators, and particularly those who intend, to oppose an increase of the allowance of members of parliament, know that the calls upon their income are exceptionally heavy. I refuse to be told that I, as a legislator for the Commonwealth, when travelling on public business, am not entitled to a travelling allowance similar to that paid to public servants. The paltry restoration of £75 to our parliamentary allowances would, if agreed to, assist to some degree to meet the expenditure which Ave must necessarily incur in doing the nation's work. Some honorable members of the House of Representatives who supported an increase of the allowance mentioned the area of the electorates they represent, and gave the distance which they have to travel in order to interview some of their constituents. It is true that some of the electorates, particularly in Western Australia and in Queensland, are large, but each honorable senator represents a whole State, and the expenditure involved in keeping in touch with his constituents is necessarily larger. A public servant receiving up to £312 a year is entitled to a travelling allowance of 12s. a day ; between £313 and £480 "the rate is 14s.' 6d. ; from £4S0 to £780 it is 17s. and from £780 to £999 it is 20s. a day. Those rates are paid even to officers who have not reached the maximum salaries of their classifications. From £1,000 and over they are paid such travelling allowances as may be determined from time to time by the Public Service Board. </para>

This afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> endeavoured to discredit the Government of Queensland, because it is attempting to balance its budget by increasing taxation instead of by reducing expenditure. I remind the honorable senator that the. Government of that State does not believe that the wealth of the nation can be increased by impoverishing the people. It does not believe in entering into a poverty competition with other countries in which the lowest only can win. We do not believe in the rice and loin cloth policy, but in maintaining a decent standard for the people. It is true that taxation in that State is higher than in the other States, and also higher than the average of the Commonwealth, but in Queensland the burden of taxation is placed upon the shoulders of those best able to bear it. </para>

                    <para>I detest the nationalist press of this country, and deplore its utter incapacity to- act as free agents. J do not include those servants of the press who do such splendid work in the press gallery of this and other parliaments. I do not belong to the political party responsible for the policy sponsored by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Murdoch, which, when put into operation in Brisbane, resulted in 120 employees being thrown on the industrial scrap heap. We know that the men who sit in the press galleries are the innocent victims of a vicious system. Our position is perfectly clear. We regard pressmen as fellow workers and we deplore the fact that they have to sell their journalistic abilities for a mess of pottage. We decline to put ourselves or the class that we represent in that position. The banquet table is groaning under the weight of everything calculated to make happy the heart of man, but the acts of this and similar governments make this plenty available only to the class which they represent, while those who do the real work of this country scramble for the crumbs.- The party of which I am a member does not oppose the remissions of sales tax or of income tax, but our complaint is that in remitting this taxation no attempt has been made to hold the scales evenly between the well-to-do in this community and those who have to struggle for an existence. It is clear from the bill that the Government is anxious to confer the utmost possible benefit upon those engaged in private enterprise including land-owners. In the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> of the 11th October, there is an article entitled " The Budget and Lower Interest." That paper cannot be accused of supporting the political party to which I belong, but it asks the Government in most definite terms when it proposes to show some earnestness in the matter of interest charged by the banks and other financial institutions which, by their iniquitous demands, are bleeding the workers of Australia white. We are quite logical when we support those restorations which the workers are entitled to expect low that prosperity is supposed to have returned. We welcome the fact that a surplus of from £7,000,000 to £9,000,000 is available, and as money is being distributed by remissions of taxes the Government should see that all sections of the community receive a just share. If I had my way I would see that the nation and this Parliament were protected from the onslaughts of the capitalistic press. I would see that it did not receive any privileges, and that for the services it receives it paid exactly the same as others do. I would deny its representatives access to the press galleries while their principals continue to bring this great national Parliament into contempt. Why should the press of Australia be permitted to continue a policy of misrepresentation and lying, and by vicious slander to ridicule a great parliamentary institution in this democratic country? Does it desire that the democratic system of government under which we are privileged to live shall some day be withdrawn, and that we may have in its place some form of Fascist dictatorship? I do npt know who will be the dictator. He may bo <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eric</inline> Campbell, one of the most incapable men I have ever met, and who, although unable to make a success of his own business, was financed to go to the other side of the world to consult with the Fascist dictators in at least three European countries. Perhaps the dictator will be <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Murdoch! </para>
                    <para>The members of the party to which I belong will support the bill. We know that we cannot alter its incidence, but we trust that even those honorable senators who, being themselves economically independent, have said that they will oppose any increase of parliamentary allowances, will show some semblance of intelligence and dignity by deciding to support the proposal embodied in the bill. </para>

For years past there has been a universal cry that the Commonwealth has invaded fields of taxation which- it should not have entered, and if, as is now proposed, certain fields of taxation are to be vacated, the States will have a better opportunity to collect revenue to assist them in developing the territories under their control. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> I disapprove the remissions of land tax, but only because I consider that the Commonwealth should completely evacuate this field, leaving it entirely to the States. Since under the Constitution, State Governments are responsible for all laws relating to land development, they should have complete control of laud taxation. </para>

                            <para>- As we shall be discussing that subject a little later, I do not intend now to occupy the time of the Senate with my views on it. Surely no one will deny that the remissions of taxes proposed in this bill will have a beneficial effect upon the people, and will, to some extent at least, lower the cost of living. It has been said that tea merchants do not intend to pass on benefits which will accrue to them from the reduction of the customs duty, and the removal of. the primage duty on tea  - concessions estimated to benefit the industry to the amount of £320,000. Although I have always been a strong advocate of tariff reduction, I wish to make it clear that, if the tea merchants regard the concessions being made by the Government as too insignificant to pass on to their customers, I shall heartily support a proposal to reimpose the duties. </para>

                    <para>As regards the proposals contained in this bill I remind honorable senators that in this debate the lesser seems to be obscuring the greater, as so often happens in other circumstances. The Government is giving remissions of taxation and other concessions to the people amounting to about £8,000,000. These concessions include a percentage restoration of cuts made in salaries and social services, and in the aggregate represent a considerable sum. But, strange as it may seem, they have been overlooked in the present discussion. I suppose that scarcely a soul in Australia could say, off-hand, by what amount the Government proposes to reduce taxation. Yet the whole country knows all about the enormity of the proposal to restore to Ministers and members of Parliament a portion of the cuts made in their allowances, at a cost to the country of about £10,000. Viewed in the light of the general budget proposals this is not a large amount, and if the Government had included it in the bill I am confident that it would have been passed without comment. As, it is, there lias been a universal howl - I cannot call it anything else - in the press about the baseness of the whole business. Let me review what really happened : According to newspaper reports, when an announcement was made in the House of Representatives that an amendment dealing with the property qualification of pen; si oners would be moved by the Leader of the Country party, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> declared that if the budget proposals were not accepted as presented, there would be an appeal- to the country. Of course, that may have been merely one of those magnificent gestures which wehear occasionally. The newspapers further stated that, on his return to Canberra about a fortnight ago, the Prime Minister sent for the chief electoral officer to question him as to how soon the rolls could be got ready for a general election. Whether or not the Prime Minister had that interview I am not able to say; I am merely quoting from press reports that the Prime Minister intended to appeal to the country if the budget were interfered with. Then, at almost the last moment in the discussion of this bill in the House of Representatives, a proposal was made for an increase of the ministerial and parliamentary allowances. I repeat that, if that had been part and parcel of the general financial proposals, I would not have opposed it. Owing to the manner in which the proposal has been introduced, I regret that T cannot support it. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable senator remarked that he had as much sympathy as have members on this side, with the unemployed. I have not the slightest doubt as to the extent of his sympathy, but the unemployed need practical relief. I am reminded of the story of a tramp who, in order to win the sympathy of a householder, knelt on the front lawn and ate the grass. The lady of the house sympathetically exclaimed, "My good man, come round to the back of the house, where the grass is much longer " ! Honorable senators on the tory side readily extend their sympathy to those in need, but the Opposition desires to do something tangible to improve the standard of living of workers, public servants, invalid and old-age pensioners, and even politicians. Honorable senators opposite are pleased to inform us that prosperity has been brought back. Personally, I do not care who brings back prosperity, so long as it is brought back alive. Twelve months ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Massy-Greene</inline> told a doleful story of the position of Australia. In his second-reading speech on the Financial Emergency Bill, he said that the position of Australia was fairly serious, and he impressed upon everybody the necessity for the utmost economy. Members of the Opposition, both in this chamber and in the other branch of the legislature, declared then that the Government knew that the position was not so bad as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Massy-Greene.</inline> He estimated a deficitof £7,681,000, but within a year the Government is proposing to remit taxes to the amount of £7,350,000. Certainly we may agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> that the days of miracles are not yet past. Has the passage of twelve months made so much difference? The Government is most fortunate in being able to remit taxes; but, in my opinion, relief is to be given in the wrong quarter. The remission of taxes will not necessarily result in an increase of employment, and the placing of Australia on the highroad to prosperity. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> stated in the budget speech that the objectives of the Government in remitting taxes were as follow: - </para>

                    <para class="block">I fail to see that the return of public money rather than the spending of it will result in an increase of employment. It seems reasonable to believe that, if a government that has been spending millions of pounds, suddenly reduces its expenditure, unemployment will increase. The community has a certain aggregate  purchasing power, and, if that power is not increased, how can more employment be given? Does the remission of taxes increase purchasing power? Much depends upon what is done with the money that is saved by remissions of taxes. If taxpayers who benefit from the remissions merely reduce their debts to the banks, employment will not be increased. </para>

                            <para>- If all debts were paid the present economic system would collapse, as any student of economics knows. As the indebtedness of a community is increased, more employment is found. During the last few years, the purchasing power of the community has fallen, because the bank deposits have exceeded the advances. In a period of deflation the banks demand from their customers the repayment of overdrafts. They limit credit, and thus reduce the amount of purchasing power ; the result is widespread unemployment. Therefore, the great need of ' the community to-day is increased purchasing power. How do honorable senators explain that during the last few years, the people of Australia have not been able to buy what they themselves have' produced? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> said that Australia cannot afford to give some of the old-age pensioners another 2s. 6d. a week. Surely this country, with all its natural wealth, can provide these unfortunate people with sufficient food, clothing and shelter to enable them to live decently. </para>

                            <para>- Already Australia is producing more sugar than its people need. Some people reading newspaper reports that sugar farms are being bought and sold, immediately jump to the con-, elusion that our wealth is increasing, whereas there has merely been a change in the ownership of certain lands.  If the  Government has a surplus which it wants to return to the people, the best plan would be to return it to those who would use it to increase their purchasing power. For that reason I am pleased that the public servants and the pensioners are to get something; I wish that they were to get more. I am glad, too, that members of Parliament are to receive a few pounds more. </para>

                            <para>- No; but I agree with the Prime Minister that members of Parliament are entitled to a restoration of a portion of the amount taken from them when restoration is being made to other sections of the community. A restoration in full of the amounts taken from public servants and pensioners would increase their purchasing power; whereas part of the proposals of the Government will mean the withdrawal of money from circulation, and, consequently, no increase of employment. What additional employment will be offered by the shipping companies which will benefit by more than £25,000 a year from the Government's proposals? The remissions of land tax. will not, I am afraid, create further employment for our people. The Government proudly claims that during its term of office unemployment in Australia has been reduced by 2 per cent, in two years. At that rate its present policy, if maintained, would take 30 years to solve the unemployment problem. The public is led to believe that these remissions of taxes will be passed on to the general » community.  Gilbey's  gin, "mothers joy", is to be strengthened according to press advertisements, but the price of tea is to be increased. A few days ago, the Prime Minister made the somewhat cryptic statement that if these remissions of taxes were not passed on, the people would know what to do. Did he mean that the people should boycott traders who did not pass on the concessions, or was his statement a warning that the Government would deal with those who failed to reduce prices? </para>

                        <para>Careful consideration has been given by the Government to the effect of tile recent property provisions of the pensions act, with the object of ascertaining whether they were operating harshly and called for amendment. The conclusion arrived at was that the law was based on sound principles, and that adequate provisions existed for granting relief in cases of hardship. It is interesting to note that, since the Government's policy in this direction was announced, no fewer than 12,074 pensions have been volu.uta.rily surrendered. </para>

The right honorable gentleman went on to say that claimants for pensions since the amending legislation was passed numbered only 31,500, compared with 44,750 for the corresponding period of the previous year, a reduction of 13,250. He said that the Government was proud of that reduction, because it represented an improved moral tone in the community. The right honorable gentleman's speech continued - </para>

As the result of agitation by a few members of the United Australia party and the United Country party and the constant pressure of the.Labour party, the Government has decided to reconsider the matter before the end of the present session. It has now come to the conclusion that, perhaps after all, the law was based on unsound principles, and so it -proposes to meet the wishes of the men who nearly turned the Ministry out of office, and will give further consideration to the property clauses of the act.

                    <para>Honorable senators opposite have condemned the land tax on the ground that it is a tax on capital. They never seem to regard, a reduction of the salaries of public servants, or the throwing of thousands of people out of work, as a tax on the workers' capital. The land tax was imposed in order to give the unearned increment on land to the community which had created it. Another purpose of the tax was to force the subdivision of properties, and to prevent the reaggregation of large estates. In this direction it has worked well. The small farmers are not affected by the tax, whether it be high or low, because no one with property of an unimproved value of less than £5,000 has to pay the tax. It is not even the big graziers who are chiefly concerned. The latest figures available show that, of the total amount collected, £1,921,000 was paid on city properties, and only £945,000 on country properties. In other words, the town provided 67 per cent, of the tax, and the country 33 per cent. Assuming that the relative assessments for town and country remain the same, the present remission of land taxation will benefit town taxpayers by £26S,000, and country taxpayers by £132,000. The total land tax remissions for the last two years amount to £1,100,000. If it be possible to make these remissions to people who are in a good position, surely it should have been possible to restore in full the salaries of public sen-ants, and to increase pensions to £1 a week. I cannot conceive why a man of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes'</inline> mental calibre should say that he is unable to support the Government's proposal to increase pensions. He said that the country could not afford to pay the increase. Yet apparently it can afford to give £1,100,000 to the landholders. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish, for a moment, to detract from the value of the work done by any public man on behalf of Australia. From the point of view of honorable senators opposite, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> has done very well, but, from our point of view, he has done very poorly. It is time that there was in power a government which would insist on the rate of interest paid on public loans corresponding more closely to the current value of money on the English market. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the proposal to increase parliamentary allowances. I do not know of any one, whether he be a socialist, a fascist, or an anarchist, who would not take pleasure in restoring his own salary. Had I been as richly blessed with this world's goods as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes,</inline> I might  have joined with him in thinking that we shall bring parliamentary institutions into disrepute by restoring to poor politicians £75 of the £250 which has been taken from them. In this connexion, it is amusing to witness the posturing of the " Cromwell of the Riverina " <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Hardy)</inline> who, I am sorry to learn, is, at the moment, ill. I wish him a speedy recovery. He has been telling the press that he wishes he were in Canberra so that he might put an end to these Tammany tactics. The public should be told that this is no more than a proposal to restore part of what we have lost. The Government has said that prosperity has returned, and it has brought down proposals to restore a portion of the percentage, reduction of public servant's' salaries. Therefore, members of Parliament, who are, in effect, public servants, are also entitled to have restored to them part of what they lost. Of course, if 1 desired to make an impression upon the people, I might say, " Take away this dross ; I will not have it." </para>

                            <para>- This is not a gift. We have been assured by the Prime Minister, and by the Leader of the Senate, that it is merely a restoration. Nevertheless, indignation has been created throughout the laud by the Associated Press, which is calling down on our heads the condemnation of the populace because wo are ma-king of this a restoration budget in very truth, by restoring something to ourselves, as well as to others. Too much lias been said on this matter by the press. I am quite willing, as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes,</inline> that we should revert to the practice of being governed by amateur politicians, provided that the change permits my expenses to be paid. We have amateur cricketers and footballers, and, as honorable senators know, it often costs more to keep the amateur than to keep the professional. There are honorable senators opposite whose incomes are ten times as large us ours and who are doing no more for the country than are we. We who have spent a lifetime in the Labour movement, working without reward, have not had the desire  to gather spoils for ourselves, and must rely upon the community to provide us with a. fair return for our services. We have nothing in the bank, and are not ashamed to accept this restoration. Since I have been a member of the  Senate  I have come to the conclusion that members of Parliament are merely a medium for distributing purchasing power to others. A number of the persons who seek interviews with me in Brisbane do so with the sole object of obtaining in one form or another some portion of my parliamentary allowance. Every man who has been in public life for any time knows of the numerous calls made upon his income, and it is grossly unfair for the press of Australia to belittle us for endeavouring to obtain a restoration of a portion of our allowance. There is no hole-and-corner business about this; in discussing the subject we have been quite frank. No newspaper can accuse us of being otherwise, and if the Senate decides that an increase of the present rate is justified we shall accept, it ; but if a majority ' should oppose a partial restoration, we shall accept the decision with good grace. </para>

                        <para>. - After listening to the speeches of honorable senators opposite, I have come to the conclusion that they do not welcome the fact that this Government has managed the affairs, of the Commonwealth during the last two years with such success that it is able to grant substantial relief to a large number of persons in Australia; the members of the Opposition are not prepared to give to the Government credit for what it has done. In fact they seem embittered because the affairs pf the country have been so successfully managed that reliefcanbe afforded to those who have been ground down by the excessive taxation,and to those whose salaries were subjected to severe cuts because of the financial stringency. I congratulate the Government uponhaving kept faith with the people of Australia. When there were expressions of regret at the heavy additional taxes that had to be imposed, and at the heavy cuts that had to be made in salaries, we were told that relief would be afforded as soon as practicable. The object of this measure is to obtain legislative authority to carry out this undertaking. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator overlooks the reason for which the federal land tax was first imposed. Every State Government imposes a land tax and the sooner the Australian people are relieved of dual taxation in this or in any other form the better it will be for them. This bill provides for financial relief with respect to land, income, sales, and entertainment tax, invalid, old-age and war pensions, salaries and wages and pensions to officers. The main argument used in support of a federal land tax was that it would assist to burst up large estates; but that objective has not been attained. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> and other honorable senators opposite should remember that although a portion of the federal land tax is to be remitted, the States still have the right to increase their land taxation if necessary so that large land-holders may not escape in the way that has been prophesied. Moreover, there is not the wide disparity in favour of the wealthy land-holder that some suggest, because a lower rate is levied upon a small land-holder than upon one who owns large areas of land. The statement that the Governpient is not holding the scales pf justice evenly between all sections of the community is not in accordance with the facts.I am glad that there is to be a further remission of the land tax. The operation of the tax has exposed the fallacy of the argument used when it was imposed, that its purpose was to burst up the large estates. It is impossible to subdivide large estates in the capital cities. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators opposite will not find in the budget speech any reference to a proposal to reduce the rate of tax on income from property. The only reduction mentioned is in respect of personal exertion, so the charge made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> that, in its treatment of the smaller taxpayers, the Government is not holding fairly the scales of justice, is not borne out by the facts. We all have sympathy with the position of the man whose income is derived from personal exertion, because we regard him as one of the real workers, and the Government has realized his need by remitting 15 per cent. of the rate levied on his income, while leaving untouched the rate of tax on income from property. </para>
                    <para>It has also been suggested that the adjustment of the taxation in respect of life insurance companies will favour the wealthy classes of the community. </para>

                            <para>- I very much deplore the spirit of antagonism that is so often displayed by some honorable senators opposite, when subjects of this nature are under discussion. Their purpose seems to be, not to lessen, but to widen, the breach existing between the different sections of the community. Apparently this is done for political purposes. Doubtless, they realize that, if the breach were closed, they would lose their occupations either as political organizers, or as the so-called representatives of the working class. Honorable senators on this side are equally concerned with the welfare of the workers, and always do what lies in their power to make more harmonious the relations existing between the employing and wage-earning sections of the community. </para>

                            <para>- I wonder how much the honorable senator really knows about the business of the tea merchants. A few days ago I read in the commercial columns of one of the city newspapers a quotation of the market, showing that there had been an increase in prices paid to growers. This being so, there must necessarily be an increase of the prices charged to purchasers. The suggestion always is that the tea merchants will retain for themselves any additional profit which may arise out of this legislation; but is it not obvious that, if tea is now costing more in. countries where it is grown, it would also be dearer to the people who buy it, but for this proposed reduction of customs duty and the removal of primage? It is a satisfaction to me to know that there has been a large addition to the list of exemptions from the operation of this tax, and I am hopeful that, when the bill is in committee, the Government will see its way clear to accept some proposals I shall submit to add a few more items to the list. But, whether or not the Government accepts my amendments, I congratulate it on having prepared such a comprehensive list of exemptions, many of which will give much-needed relief to primary producers. </para>

                    <para>The bill provides, also, for the abolition of the entertainments tax. Having always deplored the entry of the Commonwealth into this field of taxation, I welcome its withdrawal from it. I have always felt that a tax on entertainments should be exclusively reserved to the States. I am glad to know that, due to its wise administration, the Government is now in a position to abandon this impost. State Treasurers will, I imagine, welcome the opportunity to re-adjust their rates. </para>
                    <para>Part 6 of the bill gives financial relief to invalid and old-age pensioners. In connexion with this part of the Government's proposals, many extraordinary things have been said during this debate. I could not understand the statement, by one honorable senator, that not one penny of relief was to be given to those who needed it most. A3 a matter of fact, the bill provides for an increase of pensions to 17s. 6d. a week. </para>

                    <para>I have not much to say concerning the partial restoration of the percentage reductions made in Public Service wages and salaries. I welcome this move on the part of the Government. When the first Financial Emergency Bill, and also the later amending measure, were under discussion, everybody deplored the necessity for introducing such legislation, but realized that it was necessary to bring about, as speedily as possible, the financial rehabilitation of the Commonwealth. To do this it was essential that the salaries of Commonwealth employees, and pensions and other social services should be reduced, but it was stated definitely that, as soon as the finances permitted, restoration would be made to those who were called upon to make such sacrifices. I am glad to know that the Government has so successfully managed the finances of Australia that it is now in a position to include, in this bill, proposals to give effect to that definite undertaking. I hope that the second reading of the bill will be carried, and that honorable senators, having carefully weighed each provision in committee, will reach the conclusion that the measure is in the best interests of the community. </para>

                        <para>. - While the bill contains some provisions of which we must approve, I find it impossible to support all of them. I do not propose to congratulate the Government, because a great deal of the so-called prosperity is fictitious. While the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> claimed in the budget speech that the Commonwealth had a considerable surplus for this year, to which was added the surplus of last year.' he admitted that the accumulated deficits of previous years amounted to over £17,000,000. In an airy manner, he remarked that it was not proposed to deal with them at the present time. Although the payment of interest on our war debt to Great Britain has been temporarily suspended, we have no guarantee that demands will not be made for it in the future, and no provision appears to have' been made to meet that liability. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I disapprove of wrangling as to which party deserves credit for the introduction of invalid and old-age pensions. The federal Constitution, though not drawn up by labour mcn, made provision for legislation on the subject of pensions. While giving credit, to those who framed the Constitution, it is wrong to say that the Labour party took no part in the introduction of the pension. I remember that when the Deakin Government was in office, the Labour party, then led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher, supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> and made it possible for the Government of the day to establish the pension sooner than would otherwise have been possible. Certain sums had been paid into trust funds, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> suggested that that money could be used for the payment of old age pensions. None of us contends for a moment that honorable senators opposite are devoid of humanitarian feelings; but the political pressure that has resulted in practical effect being given to such sentiments in dealing with the aged and infirm has been noticed only since the advent of the Labour party. There is admittedly a tendency of one party to try to steal the thunder of another, and because of that, a government, tory at heart, will often introduce democratic measures. This tendency has been observed in Great Britain. Before, a  Labour party came into existence there, a Liberal or Radical Government would advocate, say, an extension of the franchise. That Government would be put out of office before it could pass the necessary legislation, hut the pressure from thu electorates would probably force the next conservative government to confer that boon upon the community. All political parties try to court public favour, and we ought to be frank enough to admit it. </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline>
                        said that he was not correctly quoted as having declaimed against old-age pensions. He remarked that he merely said to-day that undue importance was being attached to them. I shall submit an argument that I have previously advanced. "Would any decent family in a civilized community do other than give the best possible attention to an aged or infirm relative? Any one of us would see that a sick wife or child was given the best possible care and attention, and similarly a nation should give of its best to the aged and infirm who are a charge on the public. Therefore, if the Government is in a position to remit taxation, the most helpless section of the community has the first claim upon it. Some honorable senators seem to imagine that, because some aged persons have contrived to live on reduced pensions, 17s. 6d. a week is a munificent payment; but, as a matter of fact, we have never done more than give grudgingly to the aged and infirm. Even though the purchasing power of money may bc a little higher now than it was a few years ago, I contend that £1 a week would not be an extravagant payment to pensioners.

                    <para>The amendment of the law to enable the department to recover from the estate of a deceased pensioner <inline font-style="italic">thu</inline> amount paid in pension was most unjust, lt is true that occasionally persons with other means have taken an unfair advantage of this provision, and I offer no  opposition  to stops being taken to ensure that the department is not defrauded by humbugs; but the great majority of the pensioners have strong sentimental attachment to their old homes, which they have acquired as the result of great financial sacrifice. In thousands of cases sous and daughters have helped their 1):u eli ta to acquire a property, and the Government cannot congratulate itself on the fact that 12,000 persons have surrendered their pensions rather than lose their homes. It cannot be said that any considerable number of these people can afford to live in reasonable comfort merely because they possess a residence, for most of them have been assisted by relatives to acquire and keep their homes. It is said that the number of new applicants for the pension has decreased by 13,000. As 12,000 ha%re surrendered their pensions" owing to the property provision, about 25.000 fewer persons are now on the pensions list. No matter how large the expenditure on old-age and invalid pensions may be, the money received by them is circulated among the community more promptly than that spent in any other way. It is impossible ( for an old-age pensioner to save, because the whole of his income is needed to supply the ordinary necessaries of life. </para>
                    <para>I claim that not only the remissions of land tax, but also the proposed heavy expenditure on defence, cannot be justified while the public servants and the old-age pensioners are denied the financial relief due to them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> dealt effectively with the Government's proposal to remit land tax and I shall not repeat his arguments. I merely remind the Senate that neither the abolition nor the reduction of the land tax would relieve the great majority of the people. If the tax is not paid by the land-owner, it is paid by his  tenant in additional rentals. </para>

                            <para>- No one can add to the area of the land in the world. Some honorable senators in advocating the abolition of the land tax, have indulged in curious arguments. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> said that the object of the tax was to break up large estates. That is not so. That was the purpose of the exemption. It is true that we cannot profitably break up valuable estates in the cities, where the building allotments are small, but we should provide that those who gain by an increase of the population should repay to the public treasury the community-created increment. There is no sound argument for exempting big land owners from taxation. The abolition of the land tax would merely accentuate the evils of private ownership of land, by removing the penalty which now exists for keeping valuable land idle. The removal of the penalty would tend to create land monopolies, because the owners could wait for others to improve their property and then would reap the unearned' increment. </para>

                            <para>- That difficulty would not be overcome by abolishing the land tax. The abolition of the tax would merely provide greater facilities for obtaining money on mortgage. If I had the power, I would increase, rather than decrease, the land tax. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> said that the States already impose land taxes. There is practically no State land tax in New South Wales. Many years ago a land tax of one penny in the £ on the unimproved value of the land was imposed by the Reid Government. Later, when a system of local government by shire councils was inaugurated, the land" tax was abolished, except in the extreme western division, where there are no shire councils, and where 90 per cent, of the land is devoted to pastoral pursuits and pays no tax at all. </para>

                        contend that those who lend money on mortgages should be made secure? The abolition of the land tax would merely play into their hands ; I fail to see how it would benefit the farmer.

                    <para>The Government is to be commended for its proposals in relation to the sales tax, but there is no guarantee that the remissions will be passed on to the consumers. Reference has been made to the sales tax on tea. I know something of the tea business, for at one time I was a teagrower. There is probably more swindling in the tea trade than in the whisky trade. Some years ago, when tea in bulk could be bought for as low as 5d. per lb., the consumer could not get the commonest rubbish for less than ls. 3d. or ls. 6d. per lb. Enormous fortunes have been, and are being, made by those who stand between the grower 'and the consumer of tea. I look forward to the day when Australia will supply its own tea requirements. It1 has plenty of land suitable for the purpose, but the competition from tea grown in other countries by cheap labour makes tea-growing here unprofitable. </para>
                    <para>I shall vote for the partial restoration of t'he allowances paid to members of Parliament. I may be permitted to state briefly my attitude on this subject. When the reduction was proposed, I said that I would be prepared to accept any reduction, even to the extent of bringing my allowance down to the basic wage, or less, provided every other citizen in the community had to accept the same income. That is not socialism. My proposal would not interfere with the social system. I would allow merchants to buy and sell as they now do, but I would not allow them to retain more than a certain amount as their income. .On that occasion, I compared a bankrupt State with a boatload of shipwrecked passengers and crew. When a ship founders at sea, those who take to the lifeboats share the food and water, as well as the work. A duke's son is placed on the same footing as a stoker. I submit that in a time of emergency, a bankrupt, State should place all its citizens on the same footing. All this talk of equality of sacrifice is so much hypocrisy, because the extent of a person's sacrifice is measured not by how much he gives up. but by how much he has left. It is not equality of sacrifice to require the man on the basic wage to forgo 20 per cent, of .his wages, and to reduce another man's salary from £1,000 to £800 a year. If sacrifices are necessary in the interests of the nation, every citizen should be brought down to the same level. </para>

                            <para>- Of course they would, because they would have the same ability to, live on £4, a week. I have opposed every proposal to reduce salaries because I have regarded the amount which would be saved as such a mere fraction of what is required that the proposal amounted to nothing more than a gesture to make the public believe what brave fellows we were. Similarly, in the case of this proposed restoration, the amount involved is trifling. In. respect of private members from Tasmania and Western Australia, it will amount to only £75 a year. The amount is a mere flea-bite, though that, I admit,, does not affect the principle. I contend that the legislator's position is one of the worst paid jobs in the country. In any walk of life one of the most important factors is security of tenure, and in that respect the ordinary public servant has an infinitely better job than the ordinary politician. We have no security of tenure; we do not know when Parliament will be dissolved, or when the electors will change their minds and choose some one else to represent them. Therefore, we are compelled to spend a considerable amount of time, energy and money in campaigning from time to time in an endeavour to assure that our jobs will be renewed. Anything we can save during the life of a Parliament is swallowed up at election time. Moreover, even during by-elections, we are expected to devote our time to helping the party to which we belong. When we take into consideration all the inescapable deductions, our income probably amounts to less than half of what it appeal's to be. For that reason I have no hesitation in supporting the proposal for the restoration.   </para>

                    <para>I hope that honorable senators will have the position in regard to pensions clarified before they allocate the surplus to less deserving objects. The Government is spending large sums of money oh increased defences in response to a panic worked up by war-mongers. This expenditure is quite unjustified. There is no such thing as adequate defence; at least,, it is not possible for Australia to achieve, because we would have to provide ourselves with such defence forces as would enable us successfully to resist any hostile combination that might come against us. Even Germany, at the height of its military supremacy, was not able to do that, and there is always the danger, if we indulge in a race of armaments, that we may, eventually, be plunged into a conflict even more terrible than the last. </para>

                        <para>. - I congratulate the Government upon the many excellent proposals contained in the budget, and in the bill we are now discussing. The Government is fortunate that the improved financial position of the Commonwealth allows it to bring forward such a satisfactory balance-sheet. It is particularly gratifying that it has been able to convert a proportion of the overseas debt on satisfactory terms. The savings already effected in this way amount to £1,600,000 for the current year, and there is a prospect, if certain optional loans are converted, of saving a further large sum during the next two years. </para>

                            <para>- It is true that we are still borrowing, but I presume that the money will be wisely spent. For my part, I do not believe in borrowing, even for public works. With our huge annual revenue, we should be able to finance our public works without borrowing. Within two years from January next, about £20,000,000 of our overseas debt will mature. In addition to that, optional securities amounting to approximately £62,000,000 may be converted. As the value of Australian stocks in London is so high at the present time, there should be no difficulty in converting even this £82,000,000 at reduced rates of interest. The saving on such a conversion, however, will not be so great as on some of the other loans, because the rate of interest on these ranges from 3 per cent. to 5½ per cent., the average being not much more than 4 per cent. </para>

                    <para>It has been stated by honorable senators opposite that very little has been done to reduce interest on mortgages and bank advances. That statement is hardly borne out by the facts. Under the Premiers plan the interest on all mortgages was reduced by22½ per cent., and subsequently there was the spectacular voluntary conversion of our internal debt carrying various rates of interest into 4 per cent. stock. Those converted stocks are now well above par, which shows how remarkably our credit has recovered, both at home and abroad. It is interesting to compare the rates paid by the banks on deposits at the present time with those paid on the 1st January, 1931. I take the rates paid by the Commonwealth Bank as' an example. At that time the discount rate on treasury-bills was 6 per cent., while on the 1st July of this year it had been reduced to2½ per cent. The overdraft rate has been reduced from6½ per cent. to 4¾ per cent., while the fixed deposit rate has beendecreased from 5½ per cent. for twelve months and5¼ per cent. for 24 months to2¾ per cent. and 3 per cent. respectively. It is clear, therefore, that the investor has had to accept about half the return on his money that he was able to get in January of 1931. </para>
                    <para>It has been said that there is no equality of sacrifice between various sections of the community, and that the wealthy taxpayer has been treated unduly well. I remind honorable senators that when the emergency taxation was imposed in 1931 it was borne chiefly by the wealthy people. Much of it took the form of a super tax on property and incomes generally. The total increased burden placed on the people at that time was £27,500,000. The total remissions up to date amount to only £9,500,000, so that the public are still paying £18,000,000 more in taxation than they paid two or three years ago. Although there have been fairly heavy reductions of income tax, this levy on the people amounts to £18,000,000 more than it was two years </para>

                            <para>- That may be so; but the Constitution originally provided that the Commonwealth should not retain surpluses. I agree with the views expressed by some honorable senators that the Commonwealth should not collect more revenue than is required for carrying out the ordinary services of the Commonwealth. It would be a godsend to the States, especially the smaller ones, whose funds are depleted, if they were to receive the surplus revenue collected by the Com-  monwealth. Actually, however, there is no real surplus, because no allowance is made in those figure's for the accumulated deficit amounting to over £17,000,000. Some effort should have benn made to reduce that deficit before submitting some of these proposals for the remission of taxation.No doubt the Government has tried to do its best for all sections,and I think that it has done well. The amount of relief proposed to bo distributed this year is considerable. For instance, I notice, according to the budget, the following increases: - Invalid and old-age pensions, £635,000; war pensions, £248,000; and Public Service salaries, £550,000. I am also pleased to note that the Commonwealth proposes to restore in full its contributions to the Public Service superannuation fund. Many retired public servants have to depend solely upon these superannuation payments. The amount involved in this connexion is £80,000 annually. This is a further indication of the fact that the Government is endeavouring to assist all sections. </para>

                    <para>With regard to parliamentary allowances, I say quite frankly that I intend to vote against tha provision for a partial restoration. T do so because I consider that the time is not opportune for such a stop, and that we should have waited a little longer, until the financial position of the Commonwealth is more secure. Moreover, I do not like the way in which action is lining taken. Had the proposed increase been included in the budget instead of being brought forward at the end of an all-night sitting of the House of Representatives, it would have boeu more creditable to the  Government. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I shall be obliged to; but the additional amount will be placed to the credit of a trust fund, and used for purposes quite apart from my own parliamentary expenses. 1! sincerely hope, however, that that contingency will not arise. This proposal has been defended as being merely a restoration to members of Parliament of the equivalent of the2½ per cent. to be received by public servants, but the parliamentarian is to receive £50, plus2½ per cent. of the original cut. We beard a short time ago that the Government proposed to stand or fall by the budget, and that it would not accept any amendment of its financial proposals. But the amendment providing for increased parliamentary allowances, which was moved by a private member of the Opposition in the House of Representatives is now being supported by the Government. This is a non-party measure, and 1 feel quite free to voce upon it as I desire, and to record the protest of my constituents. The method adopted  to  bring about the increase was an easy but not a correct one. Apart from this feature of the. bill, I am supporting the Government's excellent proposals for the rehabilitation and advancement of the Commonwealth, and I feel sure that wecan look forward to greater prosperity than Australia has enjoyed in the last few years. </para>
