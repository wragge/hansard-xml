                    <para>. - Judging by the remarks made yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> and others, the tenor of my reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lukin was misunderstood. This shows the need for more attention being given to speeches made in the Senate. I did not object to his appointment to this court, because I am aware that he or any other federal judge would have been eligible for the position. I was not ignorant of the facts that the Commonwealth Government was not required under this bill to pay additional salary to him, and that under the Constitution judges must have life tenure. My particular objection was that a gentleman drawing a pension of &#163;1,000 a year from the people of Queensland had been appointed by the Federal Government to the Bench of the Arbitration Court at a salary of about &#163;2,000 a year. </para>

                        <para>. -  Yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and I put forward our case for the granting of legal assistance to poor persons in the Federal Capital Territory who may in future be engaged in litigation. We were defeated. We take our defeat philosophically, but I assure the Government that the poor people of this territory would welcome an ordinance to provide for such legal assistance. The Minister said yesterday that action along the lines indicated would be taken if &#39;representations to that effect were made by the persons concerned, and I hope that there will be no delay in honouring that promise. The number of poor persons in the Federal Capital Territory is proportionately as great as in the larger cities of the Commonwealth. Few, if any. of the people of this territory are well off; there are no wealthy persons like those who recently visited Canberra, and were loud in their praise of the Government. Since the Government is prepared to hand out millions of pounds to commercial gogetters and market-riggers, it should not overlook the claims of those poor persons in the Federal Capital Territory who have no direct representation in this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. -  Had the Minister yesterday simply objected to the new clause proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> on the ground that it was not relevant to the bill, he would have prevented further discussion.  If  the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> meets with the approval of honorable senators generally, surely the Minister can give an assurance that a provision to give effect to it will be included  in  some other measure. Personally, I do not believe in rushing into litigation if it can he avoided, but undoubtedly many persons suffer injury and loss because they are unable to pay competent counsel to plead their case for them. It is notorious that a person who is wealthy enough to secure the services of the best legal advocates has a ten-to-one chance of winning his case in the courts, whether he is in the right or not. It is the duty of any government to provide legal assistance to those whose lack of means may prevent them from receiving justice in the courts. I trust that the Minister will definitely promise that provision will be made in some measure to provide this assistance to poor litigants. </para>

I am, however, not prepared to go further than I went yesterday. The legislation in force in New South Wales, which was brought under my notice yesterday, is being considered by the Government. The practice of granting free legal assistance to poor litigants is not uniform throughout the States. In some cases the members of the legal profession undertake this class of work as an evidence of their good faith towards the poorer sections of the community. There are various ways in which litigants are protected. I shall bring the representations of honorable senators under the notice of the Attorney-General. </para>

                <para>That the paper be printed. </para>
                <para>I take this unusual course, first, because I know that the Printing Committee would recommend that the paper be printed, and also because it enables me to draw attention to the wonderful work which has been performed in connexion with this trust by the trustees as a whole, and, in particular, by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Nicholas</inline> Lockyer, who was its  chairman.  Honorable senators are aware that on his compulsory retirement from the Customs Department on account of age, in 1920, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Nicholas</inline> Lockyer offered his services in an honorary capacity to this fund, and that from that time onward he devoted himself to the work of the fund with unflagging zeal. He attended at his office at the barracks as regularly as did any clerk in the building, giving his full time every day to the work to which he had set his hand. This thirteenth annual report, which was published shortly before <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Nicholas</inline> Lockyer died, will give to honorable senators some idea of the wonderful work that has been done by the trust in the interests of the orphans and other dependants of deceased soldiers, and also of necessitous members of the Australian Imperial Force. The Canteens Fund Trust obtained its funds from two sources - first, from the balance of the profits realized by the Australian Imperial Force canteens themselves, both in Australia and overseas, amounting to about . &#163;748,000: and, secondly, from bequests by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> McCaughey and Miss Murphy, and the interest earnings thereon, totalling about &#163;650,000. The trust has distributed about &#163;1,450,000, principally in relieving distress, and in providing for the education and training of dependants and orphans of members of the Australian Imperial Force. The trust has performed a wonderful work, a significant feature of which is that not one penny of the funds distributed was contributed by any government, or by the public. The whole amount was derived from the profits of the canteens, and was therefore contributed &#39;by the soldiers themselves, and from the two bequests I have mentioned. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Nicholas</inline> Lockyer maintained his interest in this work to the end. Even when hebecame seriously ill, he insisted that the work should be brought to his bedside. I pay this tribute to the memory of a man who might have spent the last years of his life in ease and comfort, but decided to devote them to the service of the relatives and dependants of the men who died in the war.  His  record is one of which his relatives may well be proud, and for which the citizens of the Commonwealth should be thankful. My personal association with him revealed to me his marvellous courage as well as his devotion to what he regarded as  his  duty. </para>

I understand that the honorable senator will not he with us next week, and I desire to say what I have in my heart while he is still here as a member of the Ministry. No matter what our party relations may be, I am sure that all honorable senators appreciate merit and ability in their fellow senators; and I think it is generally recognized that, in the performance of his duties, both as a private senator and as a Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Massy-Greene</inline> has displayed outstanding ability and energy. Speaking as a member of the Government, and its leader in this chamber, I can say that the Government very much regrets that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> will be unable to continue in ministerial office. I know that he will assure the. Senate, as I do, that his resignation has no political significance whatever. No political differences have arisen to cause his retirement from the Government; ho leaves the Ministry solely for personal and business reasons. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MassyGreene</inline> will remain a <inline font-weight="bold">Senator and</inline> I hope that, when opportunity offers, he will continue to give to the Government his support on the floor of the Senate.  His  association with the Government as a Minister  has  been pleasant, and his colleagues deeply regret its termination. I hope that his health and prospects will improve, and that some day we shall again have the pleasure of his collaboration with us on the ministerial bench. I wish him every success. </para>

                        On behalf of the Opposition, I express regret at the resignation of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Massy-Greene</inline>
                        as a Minister in the Senate. We recognize as much as do honorable senators opposite his outstanding ability. Even when we have not agreed with him, we have listened to him with pleasure, because what he said he said well, leaving no doubt regarding his meaning.  His  resignation will be a loss not only to the Government side of the chamber, but also to the Senate as a whole. The members of the Opposition give credit where credit is due, and they agree with the Leader of the Government in this chamber, that the retiring Minister has shown exceptional capacity and application to the responsibilities of his office.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MassyGreene&#39;s</inline>
                        explanations of the measures, with which he was from time to time entrustsd, were clear and explicit, making it easier for honorable senators generally to grasp their meaning. We are sorry that he has decided to resign from office and we earnestly hope that his health will soon be restored, so that he may again take his place among us as a private senator, if not as a Minister. We, too, wish him well.

We have not always agreed with him, but I assure him that in our opposition there lias been no personal animus.

Unfortunately in this country, as in other parts of the civilized world, the influence of vested interests extends into the legislative halls, and those interests are always seeking to capture men of high calibre, integrity, and ability. The political party which endorsed the candidature of the retiring Minister chose an able man to fight its cause in this chamber. To those who serve vested interests well, a better job is always available, and, naturally, a man is disposed to go were there are more bawbees. We have no quarrel with that, inasmuch as it is a feature of the existing political and social system throughout the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Massy-</inline></para>

After all, the spice of politics is its conflict. So long as no personal ill-feeling is imported into our differences, we can enjoy the battle. I part from my colleagues in this chamber with genuine regret. When I agreed to join the Government I explained to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> that my association with it could only be brief. Although not in good health at the time, I felt that it was my duty to take a hand in the government of the country; and if I have been able to render any service to the people of Australia I am satisfied. I have tried to do my best in the critical times through which we have passed, and I am gratifiedto know that, at the moment of my severance from the Ministry, conditions in Australia are definitely on the up-grade, and the silver lining is beginning to show through the clouds. The last two years have been the  mo3t  critical in the history of Australia. I have been associated with the carrying out of a policy, with which some honorable senators do not agree, but which I believe, from the bottom of my heart, to be that best calculated to restore Australia to prosperity, and bring some ray of happiness to all its people. I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> that I have- always regarded myself as a representative, not of a section, but of all the people, regardless of their occupation or position in the community. I have striven to the utmost of my ability to do that which I believed would be of benefit to all the people. </para>

                <para>The Government has just introduced its budget for the year ; one of its objectives is to secure lower rates of interest. In this morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> appears an advertisement inserted by the Australian Mutual Provident Society to the effect that on every mortgage held by that society the interest will be reduced from 5^ per cent. to 4&#163; per cent. That is part of the reward for what Australia has done. I am satisfied that if only the country will be content to go along the lines we are at present following, we shall pull Australia out of the trough of the depression in which if has been, and raise it once more to the crest of the wave of prosperity. I do not mean to say that hard times have entirely passed. I know only too well that many of our citizens are still suffering from the consequences of the terrible depression, but what we have attempted to do, and what I have directed all my energies towards doing, is so to manage the course of out affairs that gradually, but steadily, and without the slightest risk of retrogression, Australia shall recover until every one of its people has a, chance to earn a decent livelihood. That is the aim and object of the policy for which the Government has made itself responsible. I am glad to know that that policy is bearing fruit to-day. </para>
                <para>I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> also honorable senators, and officers of the House, for the unfailing courtesy that has been extended to me during the brief time that I have held ministerial rank in the Senate. I part from my colleagues with the greatest possible regret. Between them and me there is not, and never has been, a shadow of difference regarding Government policy or any other matter. I am leaving the Ministry only because circumstances have arisen which convince me that it is my duty so to .do. After all, a man has duties and responsibilities other than those which he owes to his country. To my colleagues I wish every success, and to the Prime Minister the greatest share. I deeply regret the attacks- that are being made in my own State upon the right honorable gentleman. Those attacks, I know - and I speak from the depth of conviction and with absolute knowledge of the facts - have not the slightest justification; and they are the more to be regretted because there is no part of Australia that owes so much to the Prime Minister of to-day as does New South Wales. Honorable members will excuse the introduction of this matter into these valedictory remarks; I feel that the circumstances justify such a reference, and that I should have failed in my duty if I had not spoken. I again thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> for your courtesy to me, and I am sorry that my ministerial career is about to end - for the &#34;present, at all events. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but. they should be engaged on reproductive work. I find that &#163;7,000 is being appropriated under this measure, and a liability of &#163;6,000 is carried over, towards the cost of the National Library. For an Australian War Memorial, &#163;25,000 is provided, and a further &#163;19,S00 is to be made available from a trust fund. There is *a further liability to the country of &#163;40,500. </para>

                        <para>- -No, but war memorials are usually built with funds contributed by patriotic citizens. I realize that the proposed structure is to be a national memorial, and is to be mainly a museum. The total estimated cost to which we are apparently committed for this purpose is &#163;85,300. Provision is also made in the loan Estimates for - architectural services, &#163;16,000; engineering services, &#163;72,720; and forestry, &#163;13.500.- A further amount of &#163;8,980 is to be appropriated for sundry works and services. AH these items represent huge increases in expenditure as compared with the previous year. Wo are being asked this year to vote &#163;111,200 for services which last year cost &#163;66,300. Although no provision was made on the loan Estimates last year for expenditure in Canberra, an amount of &#163;200,000 is being provided this year. I understand that the  &#163;72,000 for engineering services is for a comprehensive scheme of street improvement. Already there are miles of streets in Canberra for which there is no use; this is one of the last places in the Commonwealth where additional roads should be constructed. I trust that the Minister will inform the committee as to the way in which this money is to be expended. Is any of it to be applied to the provision of a racecourse? </para>

                        <para>- I commend the Government for effecting reductions in taxation, but it should also eliminate wasteful expenditure as far as possible. It appears that from loan, and revenue, an expenditure of &#163;4S6,000 is to be incurred in Canberra, but according to a press report to-day, &#163;5S6,000 is to be spent. Such expenditure is unwarranted, as it is unproductive, and will not assist the country to return to prosperity. I particularly object to the expenditure of over half a million pounds on Canberra while no provision has been made to assist the great wheat industry. Last year &#163;2,000,000, and the previous year over &#163;4,000,000, was provided to assist the wheat industry, but no such provision has been made this year. Assistance in that direction is surely more urgent at this juncture than the rushing through of this schedule of works iu the Federal Capital. It is upon the wheat-growing industry that the prosperity of Australia depends. This year the wheat-growers &#34;are in a more serious position than they have been for the last -three years, and no plan to assist them has yet been announced. In these circumstances, I am opposed to the heavy expenditure in the Federal Capital Territory, which, in the circumstances, is wholly unjustified. The people of &#34;Western Australia cannotafford to contribute their share, and I object to the Federal Capital Territory receiving such a concession. </para>

                    <para>.- While I agree with much that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has said, and believe that the utmost care should be exercised in the administration of the financial affairs of the Commonwealth, it is gratifying to know that conditions have so improved, as to justify the expenditure contemplated in this bill. Dealing with the schedule in general terms, I regret  that, during the last two years, owing to the stringent financial position of the Commonwealth, the Government was not able to <inline font-style="italic">carry</inline> out very many urgent public works, and, consequently, was not able to give much -needed relief to our unemployed. For this reason I now welcome a number of the items that appear in the schedule, the expenditure upon which, I believe, Will be fully warranted. Several items commend themselves to me, and my one regret is that it was not possible to put the works in hand many years ago. I hope that the conditions next year will be such as to warrant further additional expenditure on these necessary works. I am pleased that the Government has seen its way clear to bring forward a more comprehensive works schedule this year, not only because the additional expenditure, will provide more employment, but also because the works to be undertaken are necessary in the interests of the community. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> who has just severely criticized some of the Government&#39;s proposals, represents a State that will benefit this year by the increase of the Commonwealth grant by &#163;100,000. South Australia also will get an additional &#163;150,000, and Tasmania is to be solaced  with a further &#163;50,000. Queens-&#39; bind will be one of the assisting, instead of one of the receiving States; that is to say Queensland will provide its quota of the additional grant to be given to the three States mentioned; but the only expenditure in Queensland appearing in the schedule, which may be regarded as a setoff to these grants, is the sum of &#163;25,000 for Commonwealth offices in Brisbane. I notice under the heading &#34;Business Undertakings,&#34; an item of &#163;4,460 in connexion with the Central Australian railway. This amount is slightly larger than the expenditure of last year. I was pleased to hear the leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> announce a few days ago that the proposal to lease certain portions of Central Australia or the Northern Territory to chartered companies had been abandoned, and I hope that when the Government is considering its plans for the development of the Northern Territory it will not overlook the importance of railway connexion between the Western Queensland railway system and the line from Darwin, because that project offers the best prospect for the successful development of the Barkly Tableland. Recently, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harold</inline> Nelson, the honorable member for the Northern Territory who is an authority on that province, stated in a recent article published in a Sydney weekly journal that the development of Northern Australia depended largely upon railway construction, and he placed first in importance, as I hope the Government will note, railway connexion with Queensland, a project which I have steadily advocated for many years. For this reason I regret that the item to which I have alluded is not very much greater. </para>

                    <para>. - The total expenditure contemplated in the schedule is nearly half as much again as the vote for last year. On the surface this does not appear unreasonable, having regard to the change in the financial position of the Commonwealth. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> that no benefit accrues to the country from the undertaking of unnecessary works merely to provide employment, but the works in this schedule are not in that category. For a number of years works which have been regarded as necessary have not been put in hand sim ply because the money has not been available. A notable instance of this delay in expenditure, though it may be a minor illustration, is the vote for the National Library at Canberra.

                <para>Sen ator DUNCAN-HUGHES. - Books are not likely to improve through storage in that way. To delay making the necessary provision, if money is available, is not a sound or economical policy. About eighteen months ago, when I returned to Canberra after an absence of about three years, I was astonished to discover how little had been done in the erection of new buildings, which are essential to the development of the Seat of Government., I believe that the bulk of the work appearing in &#39; the schedule is justified, but that a great deal of it was postponed during lean years with a view to being carried out when the financial position improved. It does not appear to me that the works now proposed are unnecessary, or that they will not be reproductive. I am pleased that a considerable amount is provided for defence purposes. I notice a big item of expenditure under the department of the Postmaster-General, the sum of nearly &#163;600,000 being set down for telephone exchange services. This represents an increase of nearly 50 per cent. on the vote for last year, and thoughit may be explained in general terms by the statement that the expenditure, though necessary, has been postponed owing to the financial stringency of the Commonwealth, I should like some explanation from the Minister of it. </para>

Steps are now being  taken  to implement that recommendation.  Iri addition.- to the &#163;15,000 provided  Under&#34;  this Item, &#163;5,000 has been provided under &#34; miscellaneous &#34; expenditure. The former amount is for the purpose of purchasing a vessel designed for exploratory work in connexion with pelagic, or surface swimming fish. The &#163;5,000 is for the following objects : - </para>

                <para>Our average annual imports of fish, in normal times, are valued at about &#163;1,600,000, and our local production is worth approximately &#163;1,300,000. The United States of America spends upwards of &#163;400,000 per annum on fisheries. Notwithstanding her vast store of inherited fishing resources and skill, Great Britain has recently added to her equipment another research vessel costing &#163;80,000. Japan, Germany, Norway, France, Canada and South Africa spend substantial sums annually upon research, including exploratory work by vessels specially designed for the purpose. Even countries like Turkey, Egypt, China and  the  Soviet are actively engaged upon fisheries investigations. As late as December, 1930, South Africa purchased a new - research trawler at a. cost of &#163;25.000. </para>
                <para>Some years ago, Australia had a trawling vessel which was engaged in research work in connexion with deep-sea fishing. The steamer <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> collected a great deal of valuable information which has been utilized within recent years by the trawlers operating from Sydney. Unfortunately, that vessel foundered in a storm and many of its records were lost; but no investigation has ever taken place in Australian watei-3 with regard to pelagic fish. We have sufficient information to indicate that Australian waters are visited by huge shoal&#39;s- of these fish; but we have no knowledge of their habits or as to when and where they may be captured. In all countries research work regarding that aspect of the industry is always undertaken by governments, after which private enterprise steps in. and develop the industry. It is proposed to begin the research round the southern coast of Tasmania, where I understand vast shoals of various kinds of fish are to be found at certain periods of the year; but on that matter we have no actual data. I was sceptical at first as to the value of the industry, but the data put before the, Cabinet by the Minister <inline font-style="italic">for</inline> Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan),</inline> showing the production in other countries of fish  meal  and other fish products, apart from, edible fish, greatly surprised me. </para>

During the last few years, a considerable number of applications for war service homes has accumulated. The expenditure of money in this direction is desirable because of the reproductive character of the works. I hope that the Government will now be able to grant all the applications that are in hand. With interest at the existing rates, the. work would certainly be profitable. The Government would be well advised to push on with the erection of war service homes in all the States. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am anxious that the debate on this bill shall not bc prolonged, but I cannot allow any suggestion to be made that the Queensland Government has not proceeded with its undertaking with regard to the completion of Anzac-square. With scant assistance from, the Loan Council or any other authority, the Queensland Government has completed a remarkably fine edifice on one side  of Anzac-square. It is now an obligation of this Government to complete its undertaking to build on the other side of the square. The buildings in which certain Commonwealth departments are at present housed in Brisbane are a disgrace to the central part of the city and to the authorities responsible for the occupation of them. Two fine buildings have been constructed by the State Government. Whether an arrangement that may have been made years ago for State authorities to occupy space in the proposed Commonwealth offices is adhered to or not, this Government should at once proceed with their erection. </para>

                    <para>.- I bring under the notice of the Government once more certain representations which I made a considerable time ago regarding the placing of an adequate light on the east coast of King Island. The rock-bound shores of that island render it extremely &#39; dangerous to mariners. Years ago, King Island became notorious for the number of wrecks and the loss of life for which it was responsible, and following upon some slight agitation, the west coast of the island was lighted ; but, for some reason, no light has ever been placed on the east coast of it, though the work would not be expensive. There is no justification for any further delay in incurring the small expenditure necessary to put such a light on that part of &#39;the island as would minimize the possibility of disaster there. I trust that the Government will give prompt attention to my request. </para>

                    <para>. -  Last year, Parliament voted  &#163;18,000  for the construction of, and alterations to, buildings, engineer ing services, water boring and roads in the Northern Territory, but only  &#163;6,660  was expended. The vote of  &#163;68,850  for the Federal Capital Territory last year was exceeded by over  &#163;20,000,  the actual expenditure being  &#163;90,440.  I realize that there is a tendency to spend money in places nearest the eye of the Minister and the members of the Public Service, and an outstanding example of this is seen here. I should like to know, however, why this year the sum of  &#163;111,200  is to be set aside for architectural and engineering services, forestry, and sundry works and services in the Federal Capital Territory. </para>

                    <para>&#91;5.53&#93;. -  One of the difficulties in the Northern Territory which has contributed to votes having remained largely unexpended at the end of the year is the practical impossibility of carrying out any work in the wet season. By passing this vote now, in the wet season, the money will be available at the commencement of the dry season, and it is hoped that all of it will be expended. </para>

                <para>The  &#163;111,200  set aside for various service&#39;s in the Federal Capital Territory covers such items as alterations to and purchase of houses, the erection  of certain  cottages at Griffith, and the construction of a cottage for the caretaker at the Cotter river. Buildings  to be  constructed at the cemetery site, where there are now no buildings, are estimated to cost  &#163;2,200,  and conveniences  at the  recreation oval,  &#163;1,300.  There is no provision for expenditure on the racecourse or on the showground. Engineering services in connexion with extensions to the Government Printing Office, the War Memorial, and new cottages, are included in the proposed expenditure. There is an amount of  &#163;18,000  for water supply, and  &#163;5,000  for electrical services. There are in addition various minor items for engineering services, maintenance of streets and footpaths, and the bitumen surfacing of existing roads; a sum of  &#163;3,500  for the Uriarra bridge, a convenience which has long been needed by the settlers in that locality, an amount for the Cotter bridge, and many other details which it should not be necessary for me to enumerate: </para>

As explained by the right honorable the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> in his budget speech on Wednesday last, the Government considered that, in view of the special circumstances existing at the present time, it would be of advantage to allocate this money for expenditure on loan account instead of using it for amortization purposes, Details of the expenditure proposed are set out in the bill, but I should like to supplement those details with the following brief explanations : - </para>
                    <para>Naval construction, &#163;280,000.- This amount is to include the cost of the construction of a sloop for addition to the fleet of the Navy. It is proposed that the sloop shall be constructed in Australia, thus providing additional employment. </para>
                    <para>Coast defences, &#163;150,000. - During recent years, owing to the necessity for exercising the most rigid economy in connexion with all governmental expenditure, it has not been possible to provide sufficient funds to enable defence to be maintained on an entirely efficient basis. One phase of defence that is badly in need of strengthening is coast defence, and the amount of &#163;150,000 provided in the bill under this heading should enable that to be done. Other phases of defence have been dealtwith already in the Estimates of new works from revenue. I might add that &#163;150,000 does not by any means represent what will be the complete vote for this service; but this sum is all that the Government will be able to spend for the purpose in the remaining months of the financial year. Orders have to be placed for gun mountings and guns, and, by the time an adequate coastal defence is provided, the cost will be about &#163;400,000. </para>
                    <para>Telephone Cable between Mainland and Tasmania, &#163;180,000. -For some time the necessity for telephonic communication between the mainland and Tasmania has been apparent. The existing telegraphic submarine cable is unable to provide the necessary telephonic communication. Provision of this amount will enable the work to be completed. This matter was investigated by the Public Works Committee, which recommended that the work should be carried out, but because of the financial stringency, the previous Government was unable to proceed with it. </para>
                    <para>Federal Capital Territory, &#163;200,000.- This amount is required for architectural and engineering services and housing loans in connection with the development of Canberra. The amount of &#163;151,400, which is provided for architectural services, will be expended wholly in connexion with additional housing. The exist ing housing accommodation is quite inadequate and there is a growing and urgent need for additional homes. The amount of &#163;18,600, provided under the item &#34;Engineering Services,&#34; will be utilized in connexion with the extension of the Canberra water supply. The item &#34; Loans for Housing, &#163;30,000 &#34; is provided to meet a growing demand for loans to encourage Canberra residents to build their own properties, in accordance with the policy of the Government. The bulk of the &#163;151,400 will be expended mainly on housing for the officers of other departments which will be transferred to Canberra. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> that the work is truly reproductive, as the rentals that will be charged for the dwellings should eventually repay the cost of construction. It is not, therefore, a charge on the taxpayer in the real sense of the term. </para>

                        PEARCE.Yes, otherwise it would not be possible to house the officers concerned. At present, there is a shortage of houses in Canberra. The greater part of the &#163;810,000 covered by the bill will provide additional employment, and, together with amounts for new works on the revenue Estimates, should materially assist in relieving the unemployment problem.

                        <para>. - I listened with considerable interest to the Minister&#39;s statement dealing with the expenditure of this money. He told us that, during the last two years, Canberra had been administered without the expenditure of any loan money. I wish to commend the present Government, and also the Scullin Government, which was in power during part of the time, for following this excellent policy, and I suggest that it was such a good policy that it ought to be continued. </para>

                            <para>- No ; but I desire to see the men employed on reproductive work. If Canberra is to be further developed, the very least we may expect is that luxury expenditure of this kind should be met out of revenue, and not out of loan. If the Government wishes to build these 118 new houses and flats and semidetached houses, it should do so out of revenue. I hope that loan money will not be spent on work of this kind. Although the Minister has told us that house rent and ground rent will be collected from the tenants, the expenditure will still be essentially unreproductive. I do not think that any advantage will be gained from bringing more departments here, because nearly every one at present in Canberra is engaged in doing something that could be more efficiently done elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>.- On the 4th October, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> referred to the war service homes administration in Tasmania, and stated that, so disgusted did the Government of Tasmania become with the treatment of war service homes purchasers, that it refused any longer to administer the war service homes legislation in that State, and threw the responsibility back on the Commonwealth Government. I am informed by the Minister&#39; administering war service homes that the Agricultural Bank of Tasmania acted as the agent of the War Service Homes Commission in Tasmania. For some time the bank&#39;s administration had been most unsatisfactory, but, after discussion, the Commissioner was assured by the manager of the bank that there would be no further cause for complaint. The administration did not improve, however, and, in February last, it was necessary for the Commissioner personally to examine the position in Tasmania. On his return he recommended that the Commonwealth should cancel the agreement between the Commissioner and the State Government. </para>

                    <para>The Tasmanian branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia also was dissatisfied with the bank&#39;s administration, and, at its annual conference held early in June, resolved unanimously, on the motion of the secretary of the Hobart sub-branch - </para>
                    <para>That this conference recommends the establishment of a Tasmanian Branch of the  War  Service Homes Commission. </para>
                    <para class="block">This resolutionwas conveyed to the Minister in charge of war service homes by the federal  president  of the league, who strongly recommended that the proposal he adopted. It was subsequent to the submission of the recommendation of the Commissioner, and the passing of the resolutionby the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, that the State Government signified its willingness to agree to the termination of the agreement. The Commonwealth welcomed the opportunity to change the administration, and suggested that the six months&#39; notice of termination provided in the agreementbe dispensed with, and that the commission take over direct control of the homes as from the 1st, October, 1933. This has been done, and the Tasmanian branch of the commission is now established at Bursary House, Elizabeth-street, Hobart. The Minister is satisfied that the reasons for the complaints which have been made in the past will now disappear, and that, in future, sympathetic administration will be assuredand harmonious relations established with purchasers of homes and their organizations. On the 4th October, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> referred to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sydney</inline> J. Easton, an expurchaser of a war service home. I brought his remarks to the notice of the Minister administering War Service Homes, who has now advised me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> entered into his contract to purchase the home early in 1927. He obtained an additional advance, and the total instalment payable after the rate of interest was reduced was &#163;4 6s.11d. a month. In March, 1932, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> communicated with the commission regarding his payments, and was informed that in view of his income he would be required to pay his instalments. He did not do this and vacated the home. The amount then owing was &#163;34 6s. 3d. and the liability was &#163;914 as against a loan of &#163;931. Several months after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> vacated the home, the report of the War Service Homes Committee of Inquiry was submitted to and approved by the Government, in August, 1932. If the ex-purchaser so desires and notifies the Commission accordingly, the Minister will review his case in the light of recom mendation number six made by the Committee of Inquiry, with the object of reinstating him in the home which he previously occupied. There is no cause for complaint in this case. At the time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> vacated the house, the income into the home was &#163;4 4s 2d. a week. I understand that, although he earned &#163;318s. 6d. in wages, his wife received some additional sum, such as child endowment. The present weekly income of the family is &#163;50s. 9d. When any honorable senators have similar complaints to make they should approach the  Minister in the first instance in order that the complaint may be investigated, The making of <inline font-style="italic">ex-parte</inline> statements in the Senate necessitates replies which may be injurious to the persons concerned. The Minister is, at all times, willing and anxious to hoar any complaints, because it helps him to control the administration of his department, particularly if the grievances are well founded. If they are not well founded, the honorable senators who have brought them forward will be satisfied and. undesirable publicity will he avoided. </para>
