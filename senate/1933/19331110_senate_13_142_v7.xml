                        <para>- Questions must relate to public matters, and a very liberal interpretation would be placed on the term &#34; public matter &#34; if the honorable senator&#39;s question were allowed. The Minister is asked to inform the Senate of certain relations between employers and employees in Government-owned hotels, leased to private persons in Canberra. Common sense suggests that the allowance of questions such as that would impose a heavy, and perhaps impossible task upon responsible Ministers of the Crown, who, I have no doubt, have quite enough to do. in attending to the public matters that come within their purview. Unless the honorable senator is prepared to put his question in another form, more consistent with the rules, it cannot be allowed. </para>

I thank you for your observations at the time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> because you emphasized that members of Parliament have rendered great service to their country, and, as a body, deserve greater consideration from the press. It is of the utmost importance to me&#39; and other members of the Australian Journalists Association that we should know the qualifications of journalists who are allowed by certain newspapers to Write, under their own names, criticisms of members of this chamber. The view  that I expressed yesterday was that the writer mentioned had exceeded the limit of decent criticism. That the concern shown by some honorable senators at the conduct of certain writers is shared by journalists generally is shown by an article* in the October issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Journalist,</inline> the official organ of the Australian Journalists Association and the New Zealand Journalists Association. It is headed, &#34; Plea for code of ethics to lift standard of journalism.&#34; The writer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> J. McBride, asks, &#34;Why not a test for initiates?&#34;, and goes on to say - </para>

                        <para>- I rise to a point of order. A personal explanation must bo confined to the correction of some misrepresentation in respect of which a senator feels personally aggrieved. It would appear that, in this instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDonald</inline> proposes to read a dissertation on the qualifications of journalists. I submit that such matter is not within the ambit of a personal explanation. </para>

If the court won&#39;t shut that door, we might at least insist that those who enter should conform to the prevailing prejudices, such as a shave a day, a clean collar, and a rudiment of grammar. lt is time, indeed, for the profession to he guarded by a code of ethics. </para>

                    <para>The necessity tor the present embargo arises from the fact thatin September, 1932, the present Government reduced the duty on foreign glass on a recommendation from the Tariff Board from the equivalent of 112 per cent. up to 173 per cent. to 17&#189; per cent. up to 32 per cent. Immediately orders for a year&#39;s supply of sheet glass amounting to over 4,000,000 square feet were placed overseas. This quantity has since been admitted at the low revenue rates referred to. Owing to the improved quality of Australian sheet-glass production and the impossibility of selling same in the face of the large orders which would have continued to be placed, it was essential that some action should be taken until the Tariff Board finally reviewedthe industry in Australia. The Tariff Board in its report of January.1933, recommended the retention of the embargo pending such reexamination of the position of the Australian industry. It will be observed that despite the embargo, importations from Belgium during the last financial year are six times greater than importations during the financial year 1931-32, and three times greater than during the financial year1930-31. </para>

                        <para>. - I am gravely concerned at the proposals contained in this bill. The Government also seems to have been exercised in mind over the matter, and that is probably why the Tariff Board&#39;s report dealing with the effect of exchange on the tariff, though eagerly sought for a long time by honorable senators, has only recently been placed in their hands. The settled policy of this country has, for many years, been one of protection, and anything which threatens to interfere with the prosperity and development of our secondary industries must receive the closest scrutiny.

We must be careful when we enter into an agreement with the people of another part of the Empire, that we do not penalize ourselves. It seems to me that, in this measure, we are giving away more than is wise.

                    <para>If tariffs are reduced, the volume of imports will increase, and Australian.made goods must be displaced. The result will be still further unemployment, in addition to the hundreds of thousands of men now out of work. Then the primary producers will clamour for assistance from the Government by way of bounties and special legislation. According to a report issued by the Commonwealth Statistician, for the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1933, imports into Australia valued in sterling, were &#163;57,985,000, of which merchandise represented &#163;56,820,000, and bullion and specie &#163;1,165,000. For the previous twelve months the total imports were valued at &#163;44,713,000, of which merchandise represented &#163;44,043,000, and bullion and specie &#163;670,000. The importation of merchandise increased during last year by 29 per cent., and that increase can only result in the displacement of Australian labour. </para>
                    <para>The Tariff Board has prepared a voluminous report on the effect of exchange. I confess that I have not had the time to go through it as carefully as I should like. The board has gone to a great deal of trouble to work out a formula which, in its opinion, will enable Australian industry to be protected without allowing the burdon of exchange to press too heavily on the people. I am not sure, however, that the board is satisfied with its own formula, which. I feel sure, will be as inexplicable to other honorable senators as it is to me. The formula for the adjustment in duties of customs seems to be so intricate that I am afraid it will cause a great deal of trouble in administration. It would be much preferable to revert to the old method of customs administration, at all events, until such time as a simpler proposal can be devised. Many people cannot understand why the rate of exchange on London should be fixed at 25 per cent. Some, I imagine, believe that it is partly responsible for the in crease of imports, though, as  a  matter of fact, it is of distinct advantage in the exportation of our surplus products. It is regrettable that, because of the chaotic state of world affairs, due to a variety of causes, the financial relations between the various countries should lack stability. Expressed in Australian currency the adverse ratio of exchange necessitates, I understand^  the  payment of an additional &#163;20,000,000 or &#163;22,000,000, in respect of our overseas trade and indebtedness-, so if relief could \ be given in this direction it would  be  very acceptable to the people. </para>
                    <para>As to the general provisions of the bill, honorable senators of the Opposition are whole-hearted supporters of Australian industries, and to  ensure  their development we favour proposals to prohibit the importation of those commodities which can  be  economically produced in this country. The exchange adjustment formula attached to this measure is, I believe,  the  result- of intensive study on the part of the customs authorities, but I doubt  that  many honorable senators really  understand  it. Believing that the  Tariff  Board&#39;s recommendations, with reference to primage and exchange, <inline font-style="italic">an</inline> not  supported  by the facts, I intend to  vote  against the second reading of the bill  in  the hope that it may he possible to  devise  more effective machinery for  the protection  of Australian industries. . </para>

                        <para>. - I am wondering if  the  silence of Government supporters is  an  indication that the bill does not meet with their approval, and if, when the motion for the second: reading is put, its fate will be the same as that which befell other items of the Government&#39;s fiscal policy  in this chamber yesterday. The Government is asking us to approve the formula to be employed in assessing the protective incidence of exchange, and because of its complicated nature, I think that the best thing we can do is to follow the advice given by my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> a few minutes ago, namely, not to examine its intricacies too closely. The measure is of much greater importance than might be implied by the silence of Government supporters. We may, I think, quite reasonably assume that outside interests are watching very closely what is being done by the Senate, and endeavouring to measure the effect which these proposals will have upon Australian industries. A few months, ago, when we were discussing the tariff, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> and other honorable senators who are nominally supporters of the Government, clamoured for the production of the board&#39;s report, in order that they might have ample opportunity to discuss the protective incidence of exchange before approving the Government&#39;s tariff policy. And, remembering their repeated demands for the report, I am at a loss to understand why they are now silent. May we take it that this exchange adjustment bill .does not go far enough, or, does it go too far? Are they silent because they are disgusted with the measure? In December last the Government asked the Tariff Board to report upon .the incidence of primage and exchange in relation to the customs tariff, and, in moving the second reading of the bill yesterday, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> gave us a lucid explanation of the various submissions that have been made by the board. After an inquiry lasting some months, the board&#39;s report was presented to the Government, and portion of its recommendations with regard to exchange are em-, bodied in this bill. The board recommended that action should he taken on certain definite lines to adjust the protective tariff in respect of goods to which the British preferential tariff applies, and suggested also that similar treatment should be  accorded goods from countries whose currencies are on the sterling basis. Another recommendation related to goods from countries&#39; that are still on the gold basis, and in yet another recommendation, which has been incorporated in a separate bill, the board suggested that increased protection be given to Australian industries against competition from countries with depreciated currencies. So far as I have been able to understand the basic principles upon which the board&#39;s recommendations are founded, it seems to me that the Government is prepared to give Australian industries a stab in the dark. The report contains no data, and no specific principles were enunciated in the second-reading speech of the Minister, to justify acceptance of the formula which he has asked us to adopt. The Minister admitted, in the course of his speech, that Parliament was being asked to pass experimental legislation of a kind which, so far as I can gather, has not been even contemplated in any country whose- circumstances are substantially similar to those of Australia. Why should Australia be the pioneer in this legislation, instead of continuing to tread the well-known pathway of protection, regardless of currency changes and manipulation, which are due to various causes? Protection has been the established policy of Australia for over 30 years, and I see no reason why this country should explore the wilderness, in the hope of finding a path to the Promised Land. I fear that we shall find ourselves in an industrial desert, which may be strewn with the wreckage of Australian industries, and the unemployed will be left in their present desperate plight. Before we take this step we should have much more reliable information of the need for it. </para>

                    <para>To some features of the Tariff Board&#39;s investigation, the attention of the Senate should be drawn. An examination of the list of witnesses shows that the principal opinion expressed in the evidence was that of importers or their representatives. Most of the testimony came from those interested in the importation &#39;of goods into Australia, and particularly British goods. I realize that the inquiry was of a public nature, and ,that manufacturers and their representatives had the same opportunity as importers had to present their views; yet I venture to say that an unbiased examination of the case submitted to the board on behalf of the </para>
                    <para class="block">Australian manufacturing industries would lead to the conclusion that they furnished a strong case for the maintenance of adequate duties, and the exclusion of exchange considerations when determining the amount of protection to be given. I have no intention to reflect upon the board ; but, from hundreds of reports which have been received from it during the past eighteen months, the main fact that emerges is that the board is either consciously or unconsciously giving effect to the well known policy of the predominant party in this Parliament, whose desire is to reduce the protective tariff. </para>

It seems to me that the board has been made the stalking horse of the party in power. Is the fiscal policy now being pursued by the Government in conformity with the pledges given by the United Australia party when it sought the votes by which it was returned to office? </para>

                        <para>It is recognized that in many efficient industries the price of the output is fixed on local consumption or on production costs, and is much below the price of imported duty-paid goods. </para>

In an effort to justify the rejection of the case submitted by the Australian manufacturers, the board stated that some industries, because they are greatly over-protected, use the protection afforded by the tariff, plus the protection afforded, if any, by exchange, to exploit the Australian people and make huge profits for themselves. If that be true, the board, with all the machinery for investigation which it has at its disposal, and with the complete knowledge of Australian industry which it claims to possess, and for which this Government gives it credit when that attitude suits its purpose, should be able to give at least one instance of an industry in which such conditions obtain. Not one instance is given to support the board&#39;s general statement. That inconsistency is characteristic of the report. Recognizing that the Government desired to placate the Country party by making further reductions of the protective tariff of this country, the Tariff Board set out to find for the Government a means of doing that. </para>

                            <para>- It is typical of the honorable senator that when he is defeated on one point he tries to divert the discussion into other channels, but I shall not so easily be diverted. It is significant that the Tariff Board&#39;s report gives only a summary of the evidence of Professor Giblin, a gentleman for whom all of us have a high regard, whereas a copy of the full evidence of practically every other witness is attached to the report as an appendix. All that we know of Professor Giblin&#39;s views is what the board has been pleased to permit us to know. Professor Giblin pointed out the difficulty of ascertaining whether the exchange rate gave to Australian industries a measurable amount of additional protection. 1 take the following extract from the summary of his evidence: - </para>

                        <para>J &#39;or hups I might put thu position as I sue it. We have a movement in the exchange compared with two or three years ago. In general, in a perfectly free-moving economic system, which you never have in practice, you expect twu things to happen with a movement in the exchange. You expect the prices of imported goods to move up to the extent of the movement in exchange. That, in fact, does generally happen. You also expect the internal costs in the country to move up in the same direction, with more or less lag relatively to the external country - how far and how long being, perhaps, a rather controversial question - but you do, in general, expect a very considerable, almost in the long run an equivalent, rise in costs. </para>

                    <para class="block">If that statement is correct, there is, in the long run, no protective incidence of exchange so far as Australian manufacturing establishments are concerned. Immediately after the exchange has been increased, Australian industries may derive some benefit from it, but, eventually, the tendency is for local costs to rise. It is, so to speak, an instance of water finding its own level. Even admitting that the cost of imported goods is increased by 25 per cent, as the result of the exchange operating against importers, the cost of the locally manufactured article is eventually increased in the same ratio, first, because of the increased price of imported materials, which have to pay exchange;  secondly,  because the higher prices obtained, as a result of the exchange, for locally produced raw materials exported to the markets of the world automatically increase the local price to a corresponding extent; thirdly, because of the influence on wages of the higher prices obtaining in Australia for wool, meat and other commodities, as a result of the exchange premium on the exportable surplus of those commodities; and, last, but by no means least, because of between &#163;20,000,000 and &#163;22,000,000 which the exchange is computed to cost Australia annually, about &#163;7,000,000 represents additional interest payments on the overseas indebtedness of Commonwealth and State Governments. These things add to the cost of all the public services which are supplied to industry, and to workers in industry, by the State Governments of Australia. About a fortnight ago the State Auditor-General presented to the South Australian Parliament a report showing how the cost of water, sewerage and railway services had been increased to every manufacturer as a result of the exchange. That is an important factor. The Tariff Board&#39;s report contains no evidence that these things were taken into account; and, in the absence of that evidence, it is dangerous for us to pass this legislation. </para>
                    <para>The Government has frequently expressed the opinion that exchange should be free from political interference, and left to the control of thu Commonwealth Bank Board. Although in this legislation Parliament is not actually interfering with the control of exchange, it is deliberately interfering with the effect of exchange. I see no difference between interfering with the control of exchange and taking action to destroy its effect. Even if this bill does not reduce the protective incidence of exchange by practically 50 per cent., it certainly destroys the effect of exchange. That is an effective means of implementing the political control of exchange which the Government professes to dislike. Both in this chamber and in the House of Representatives this bill has been acclaimed as the greatest contribution to British trade since 1907. The Minister referred to it as constituting a substantial move towards freer intraEmpire trade. The primary object of this measure is to increase the preference to Empire goods. </para>

                            <para>- The duty of every good Australian is to endeavour to establish conditions which will make for the prosperity of both primary and secondary industries. We have repeatedly discussed the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> interjection, and members of the Labour party have proved that the best market for primary products is the home market. The farmers are better oft&#39; when they are selling their meat, eggs, butter and milk to the people who are employed by the secondary industries. The Government has said that it is not in favour of tariffmaking exclusively by Parliament. No protective duty should be raised or lowered, it states, until after inquiry into the specific matter by the Tariff Board. Now, however, the Government proposes to take action that certainly is based on a Tariff Board report, but a report following a general inquiry, which paid no regard to particular industries. Another measure is to be introduced shortly, to give special protection, as regards exchange, to those industries which have to face competition from countries with depreciated currencies, but under that measure no relief will be given until a specific inquiry has been made into the industry claiming assistance. The Tariff Board has made a general inquiry into the effect of exchange, &#38;c, on protection, and has furnished some general recommendations, on the strength of which the Government has introduced a measure which will reduce the effective protection enjoyed under the British preferential tariff by industries which produce 839 tariff items. Of this total, 101 items will carry an increased preference of from 5 per cent, to 10 per cent. ; 213 will carry increased preference of over 10 per cent., and up to 15 per cent.; 83 will carry increased preference of over 15 per cent., and lip to 17-J per cent. ; one will carry a margin of 20 per cent.; while, on 441 items, under which specific rates operate, increased preferences, mainly of 17^ per cent., will operate. The list of items covers nearly nine foolscap pages, and on all of those items the effective protection is to be decreased- by amounts varying from 5 per cent, to 20 per cent. Most of the reductions are to he put into effect by the measure we are now discussing. </para>

                        <para>You have a presumption that the duty could bc reasonably lowered by the amount of exchange, with allowance for the proportion of raw material which is either imported or could be exported. That is an idea which I know is familiar to the board. That is a presumption which, I cannot see at present, you could apply safely to any industry automatically. My feeling is that you would have to make some kind of review of the general conditions of any industry before applying a reduction on those lines. In some industries it might be that the total costs have risen quite considerably relatively to those in England, and that a reduction of anything like the full amount of the exchange, even allowing for imported  material,  might not be fair to that industry. </para>

                    <para>Many new industries have been established in Australia during recent years, and those who put money into them were led, by official declarations, to believe that the advantage they enjoyed as a result of the exchange rate would continue for a considerable time. The Government stated that, as a matter of policy,&#39; the exchange rate was to be regarded as one of the factors in . the economic rehabilitation of the country, and it also stated that it was opposed to governmental interference in fixing the rate of exchange. In the circumstances, manufacturers were justified in believing that the protection, great or small, which they enjoyed as a result of the exchange, was likely to continue while the existing economic conditions remained unaltered. Now, however, without there being any discernible change in economic conditions, it is proposed in this measure to vary the protective incidence of exchange. Many of the industries which will be affected either did not have an opportunity to put their case before the Tariff Board, or did not seek to do so, because they were satisfied with the protection  they were enjoying under the tariff, plus primage and exchange. The Government is asking Parliament, on the incomplete data which the Tariff Board has furnished, to take a most important step. The Minister, when introducing the bill-, made out a very weak case, and there does not seem to be any desire on the part of his supporters to attempt to fortify it. I trust that the Senate will reject the measure. </para>

                    <para class="block">I should like the Minister in charge of the bill to explain why the Government Las completely ignored this important portion of the board&#39;s recommendation, which, if adopted,would also extend whatever benefits are provided to British dominions and to foreign countries. I appreciate the fact that the Government has applied the Tariff Board&#39;s first recommendation to importations from Great Britain ; but it has not gone far enough. This measure will not be satisfactory to me unless the recommendation of the board which the Government has adopted is extended to those countries whose currencies are appreciated relative to sterling. This aspect of the matter was fully debated by the members of the Country party in the House of Representatives where an amendment was moved to extend the relief to the full extent recommended by the board. When the measure is in committee I propose to move a similar amendment. If such an alteration is agreed to the benefits to be conferred under this measure will apply, not only to Great Britain, but also to British dominions, and to foreign countries whose currencies are appreciated relative to sterling. In order to show the consideration given to Australian industries, I quote the following from the report of the board: - </para>

                        <para>It is important to remember -that the board in its calculations - the results of which are given above - has assumed that the local industries are protected by the minimum, or merely equalizing duties. In actual fact, there is almost invariably an additional protective or safety margin which, if included in the calculations, would show the local industries to be in a much safer position than is indicated. </para>

                    <para class="block">Although the board states that local industries have a much larger margin of protection than is assumed, the Government is adopting only one half of the meagre relief recommended in the board&#39;s report. The report continues - </para>

                        <para>Furthermore, the duties recommended by the board on industries which have been reviewed since the exchange has been adverse to Australia have for the most part been based  upon  local costs, which already include the effect of exchange.

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators will see that the arguments raised by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;Halloran),</inline> in an excellent speech from his viewpoint, but one with which I entirely disagree, are met by the board. I listened with interest to the honorable senator&#39;s remarks, and I say, with due respect, that he was shedding crocodile tears for the protection of Australian industries when he said that they would not be protected under this measure. It is quite clear that even under this measure and. the Ottawa agreement, British manufacturers have little opportunity to compete in the Australian market. If we could read the thoughts of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, and of the members of his party, we would find that they realize the futility of this measure as a means of relieving the primary producers of the fiscal burdens they are now carrying. It is serious to think that the great primary industries of Australia are receiving only one-half of the assistance recommended by the Tariff Board. Full relief could be given by adopting the whole of the recommendations of the hoard. We have asked why this form of relief has been confined&#39; only to Great Britain ; but we have not received a reply. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> said in his policy speech, and on many occasions since, that the tariff policy of th&#171; Government would be based on the recommendations of the Tariff Board. The failure to extend the proposed relief to the produce of sister dominions and foreign countries is a flagrant breach of that policy. The breach is more serious because the recommendation applies, not to one series of articles, but to all those covered by the tariff schedule, many of which are vital to our great primary industries. I intend to support the bill as far as it goes; but, when it is in committee, I shall move that its provisions be extended to cover the produce of all the countries recommended by the Tariff Board. </para>

I was surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran,</inline> who severely criticized th&#39;e measure, overlooked the fact that our protective policy has not been built up upon a fluctuating exchange rate, and the Tariff Board has not taken into consideration the protective effect of a high exchange rate. The board has repeatedly declared that in considering the rates of duty that should be imposed, it has not taken into account the protective &#39; incidence of exchange. If it had done this, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran&#39;s</inline> criticism would have been justified to some extent. </para>

But the honorable senator did not accurately state Professor Giblin&#39;s views. Instead, he selected certain paragraphs which he read without regard to the context. I also intend to quote from a statement made by Professor Giblin in order to show that the honorable senator placed an entirely wrong construction on the witness&#39;s considered opinion on this subject. On page  55  of the Tariff Board&#39;s report, there appears a summary of the evidence given by Professor Giblin from which I take the following : - </para>

                        <para>It is impossible for any one to make any kind of judgment as to the exact correction to be applied, on account of exchange or anything else, to duties fixed on a survey of conditions two or three years ago. I should say that the present position made a scientific tariff - if that phrase is still allowed - a practical impossibility; that you would have to be examining every industry at intervals of about six months intensely before you could be sure of the proper correction to he applied to old duties. That is impossible, and practically you could only expect to make a rough shot. Certainly there is no kind of automatic adjustment or formula that would make at all exactly the proper correction. I think it is quite possible that the hoard, with its intimate knowledge of a great many industries, may bc able to make a fairly rapid judgment as to the proper correction in most cases. In others, closer investigation would be necessary. That may or may not be so, but I am sure that no one else - certainly not an economist by general reasoning - can safely attempt to specify the correct adjustment. A good number of Australian industries are not using anything like the full protection afforded by the old tariff, swollen by exchange and primage. </para>
                        <para>The products&#39; of these industries are now sold at a price with which imports could not compete, even with the lowered duties. There would, therefore, he no increase in imports of these goods, and the Australian price of these goods would not be altered. Other industries are using all, or nearly all, of the inflated protection now provided. The excess price must be duc either to unreasonable profits or unnecessary inefficiency. It is clearly in the power of these industries to reduce prices to a. level at which imports cannot compete. There will, therefore, be no substantial lasting increase in imports of these goods, but in this class of goods the Australian price will be reduced. There would bo some temporary flurry of imports, but of no great importance. Where excessive prices were due to remediable inefficiency, a few months might bo required to get Australian  costs  down. The announcement of lower duties might stimulate oversea exporters to shipments not really justified by the new price condition; and on which they would suffer loss. These would not be repeated. I should not expect the temporary flurry to be more than &#163;1,000,000 for the whole year, nor the permanent increase to be more than one-quarter of that value. </para>

                        <para>The previous discussion has, for simplicity and brevity, been confined to the protection required against British imports. I have said that an all-round reduction of duty, either by 15 per cent, or by one-third, would amply preserve the protection given to Australian industry, and would result in no diminution of protected production in Australia. In other respects, it would have a number of beneficial effects, lt would reduce costs to the consumer and to other producers, not only by the amount to which taxation would be reduced (estimated above at &#163;1,500,000), but by the amount, probably a good deal greater, by which the excess cost of Australian protected production would be lowered. A great part of this relief will find its way to the export producer, who most needs it,  and  to the producers competing with imports. A lowering of the tariff is always partially offset by the lowered costs in protected industry itself. When it can lie done without impairing Australian protected industry, it is an unmixed good, except to Commonwealth revenue. But, when there is at present a strong case for decreased taxation and a practical possibility of making it, then even that exception does not count. Further, at the present time, when the universal depression is closely linked with harriers to international trade, any lowering of those harriers is at least a hopeful gesture in the direction of recovery. It is, perhaps, the one contribution that a country like Australia can make to the&#39; combined effort for international recovery. Its psychological effect will be considerable, particularly in Great Britain. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have, I think, quoted sufficient to show that Professor  Giblin&#39;s  opinion supports the policy of the Government, as expressed in this bill. I resent the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> that the Government is using the Tariff Board to break down the protective policy, and that the high protective duties imposed a few years ago by the Scullin Government may be regarded as representing the accepted policy of this country. Those excessive duties were brought in by the Scullin Administration in defiance of the representatives of the people in this Parliament; we had no opportunity to discuss them in any way. By virtue of the power given to the Government under the Customs Tariff Act, they were imposed by resolution and without regard to their probable effect on industry generally. I have, on many occasions, advocated that the protective incidence of exchange should be considered, in conjunction with other matters, when Parliament is imposing new or amended duties. For this reason, I welcome the bill, and will vote for its second reading, but I regret that the Government has not been able to go a little further in this direction. I accept is as a first instalment of a reform that is long overdue. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> that the effect&#39; of exchange on imports from other countries besides Great Britain should be considered. We must, I think, admit that Australia cannot live to itself, and that unreasonable duties levied on commodities from countries that are good customers of ours will lead to reprisals. Recently the newspapers published cabled reports from London that the Government of /Belgium intended to place an embargo on the importation of certain Australian primary products, presumably in retaliation for the excessively high duties imposed on glass. In connexion with this matter, I have received the following letter from the Adelaide Corn and Produce Exchange, dated the 7th instant: - </para>

                            <para>- It is pertinent to the subject of international trade, and I referred to it because of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston&#39;s</inline> protest against the operation of the bill being confined to imports from Great Britain. Notwithstanding the opposition shown to the measure by honorable senators opposite, I hope that they will eventually recognize that the promotion of trade between Australia and other parts of the world will benefit, not only the primary producers, but also the industrial workers. I have always advocated a policy of sane protection. Every feature of the tariff that savours more of exclusion than of protection should bo eliminated. </para>

                        <para>. - We are discussing one of the most important bills that have come under our notice for a considerable time. In discussing another matter yesterday I had something to say about Australian sentiment, and this afternoon I desire to lead honorable senators who intend to support this bill back to the only safe basis upon which we can deal with a measure of this kind - genuine Australianism. The short history of this country is an epic of remarkable fortitude, capacity and progress. Little more than a century and a half has elapsed since Captain Cook landed in Australia. Until about 75 years ago this continent was still a convict settlement of another country. Australia has enjoyed responsible Government for a comparatively brief period. This was granted to New South Wales in 1842; to Victoria in 1855 ; to South Australia and Tasmania in 1856; to Queensland in 1859; and to Western Australia in 1890, only 43 years ago. In 1901, federation was consumated; but up to that time the people had shown a determined and growing belief that, because of the problems that beset older countries, it was necessary to formulate a national policy to reserve Australia for our own kith and kin. In the late eighties, the white Australia principle was discussed and considered within the realm of practical politics, and in 1.901 it was embodied in the Immigration Restriction Act. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that matter later. The record of the pioneering work and the fortitude of the early settlers reads like a fairy tale. In proof of this I shall quote from the production statistics for 1931-32. I select that year in order not to over-colour the picture. These figures are very conservative, because at that period a serious slump occurred in the prices of our primary and manufactured products. The value of our dairy production in 1931-32 was &#163;41,500,000; wool was worth &#163;35,000,000, wheat &#163;30,000,000, meat &#163;22,000,000, sugar &#163;10,000,000, and manufactures &#163;281,500,000. I am reminded Qf Abraham Lincoln&#39;s famous remark to the tariff slashers of his time, the equivalent of the Country party representatives in this Senate : &#34; Fill your factories and your farms will automatically fill themselves.&#34; The remarkable achievement of Australia furnishes an example to the whole world. Our original stock largely consisted of people who were sent here because they had a little more courage and initiative and willingness to take risks than others, even though many of them wore the broad arrow on their clothing, and were described as convicts. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, poverty, the result of evil economic and social conditions, no doubt drove many of the early settlers to Australia. All through those earlier days in the development of Australia the people worked to set up a beacon light for the rest of the world. They have set for democracy a higher standard of living, and they have ensured for all a greater measure of decency, dignity, health, education, leisure, happiness, and equality of opportunity. Even to-day, despite all the difficulties that the serious- depression has brought in its train, the living conditions of our people are superior to those of any other. We have a more even distribution among all the people of the things which  make for comfort and happiness than is to be found anywhere else on God&#39;s earth. Why, at this stage in our history, is it proposed by means of measures of this kind to lay profane hands on the national policy of Australia, to which all political parties have agreed, and which no party claims as its own ? </para>

                    <para>What is proposed to be accomplished by this hill, and why is it submitted to us ? Let us endeavour to get down to bedrock, and understand what we are actually debating. This bill apparently means but little. It&#39; is, however, fraught with &#39; serious&#39; intent. The technical jargon in which the measure is couched has been prepared not by the Tariff Board, but by the permanent heads of the Customs Department. The bill is clothed in the technical language of departmental experts, and I venture to say that nobody in this&#34; chamber understands this jargon, or is expected to do so. Practically the whole of the business submitted to this Parliament is determined by the requirements of political strategy, and that is certainly the reason for the presentation of this measure. The idea in the mind of the Government is that it should take no risk of defeat. It realizes the need for meeting the arrogant and truculent demands of members of the Country party in this chamber, while attempting at the same time to keep one foot in the camp of the manufacturers. With a pretence of seriousness and dignity, an attempt is made to cover up the real motive of the Ministry. </para>

                    <para>We, in this chamber, use the word &#34; exchange &#34; as though we understood all about it, but do we really understand its meaning? The exchange problem is the basis of this bill. Because of the exchange situation, we are asked to lay profane hands on the fiscal policy of Australia. The Tariff Board has been asked to say to what degree the knife shall be thrust into the things which are necessary to the development of this country. In all financial gambles, everything depends on the accuracy of what is termed &#34;inside information.&#34; Two notable historic examples of this fact are mentioned in the following newspaper extract : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The original founder of the great French banking house of the Rothschild family was a  very  enterprising person. He arranged a plan to get first-hand &#34; inside information &#34; -concerning the results of the Battle of Waterloo, by means of relays of mounted couriers. Thus he was able to get the news of Napoleon&#39;s decisive defeat before that news was known in general European banking circles. </para>
                        <para>British &#163;100 war bonds then stood at the very low figure of f 40, and . French bonds were correspondingly high. Rothschild sold out French securities in Paris and bought British bonds in London, making a colossal  profit  on these transactions. </para>
                        <para>Two other eminent pillars of private enterprise, Cecil Rhodes and Joseph Chamberlain, at a later period of our history had &#34; inside information &#34; concerning the certainty of war &#39; between the Boer Republic and Britain. </para>
                        <para>The Rhodes group netted over &#163;6,000,000 &#34;by securing forward options over Argentine meat supplies, buying in at 3d. per pound and selling out at lid. to the British War Office. Chamberlain, by means of an alliance with the German firm, Krupp and Schneider, secured a world monopoly of the manufacture of cordite. This product cost 4d. per pound to make, and was sold nt 3s. !)d. a pound to Britain during the Boer war. </para>

                        <para>A very small group of private financiers had &#34; inside information &#34; concerning this financial juggle, and they used that information to their great personal profit. </para>
                        <para>In these days of &#34; cable transfers &#34; any one knowing that this rise in exchange would happen could &#34;.bet on a certainty&#34; by transferring, say, &#163;1,000 from Australia to England, and getting it back again next week at a profit of &#163;300 on the transaction. </para>
                        <para>This sudden jump in exchange raised Australia&#39;s overseas interest liabilities by about &#163;12,000,000 ;per year, and it is quite probable that private debtors suffered a loss to somewhere about the same amount. </para>
                        <para>There have been three explanations furnished to the public as to the reason of this sudden change in exchange rate. The first was that it was a wise  precaution  adopted by our local banks to prevent an abnormal &#34;flight of capital &#34; from this country. </para>
                        <para>The circulation of this statement was certainly not calculated to restore confidence, and, therefore, the actual promotors of the project devised a second explanation. </para>
                        <para>The bankers now said that they had nothing whatever to do with the rise of exchange,. and that they made no profit whatever out of it. They said that this change was wholly due to inexorable and unalterable economic laws. They explained that we had been importing too much and exporting too little, and that the &#39;balance of trade&#34; was against us, and it was that factor which automatically determined the exchange rate. </para>
                        <para>Later on it became evident that this explanation was not a satisfactory one. Imports fell very heavily, and exports rose until there was an absolutely embarrassing credit balance in our favour in Britain, yet the rate of exchange did not come down until very recently there was a leak in the artificial barriers somewhere, and there was a fall in the exchange down to 25 per cent. </para>

                        knew that he was camouflaging the facts. A prominent financial writer commented on that statement in the following terms: -

                    <quote>
                        <para>Just imagine a small Australian primary producer, with only one hundred pounds&#39; worth of produce, &#34;shipping it overseas.&#34; The thing is preposterous, for overhead charges on so small a parcel would be ruinous. </para>
                        <para>What actually happens is that the small Australian primary producer - who is usually in debt - sells his produce here to an exporting corporation, and receives payment in Australian pounds. That ends the transaction as far as he is concerned. </para>
                        <para>The exporting middleman corporation buys up the produce of ten thousand primary producers, and ships the lot overseas, where it is disposed of for British pounds. Not being a charitable organization, the corporation exchanges this British credit for an Australian credit at a local financial institution, at an advance of twenty-five per cent., and this closes that transaction. </para>
                        <para>Every day we see in the commercial columns nf our daily newspapers records of local sales of wheat, wool, hides, skins, tallow, and all kinds of primary products, either by auction or by &#34; private arrangement.&#34; </para>
                        <para>All these sales are local transactions. The proceeds are paid in Australian cheques, whose value is expressed in Australian pounds. Exchange plays no part whatever in such transactions. </para>
                        <para>The rise in exchange was a tax levied without the authority of Parliament, not only upon goods which in future would be imported into Australia, but on all goods previously imported, but not paid for at the date when the exchange toll was levied. It meant ruin to many people who had imported goods, sold them again, and then were suddenly confronted with a demand to pay thirty per cent. over the price stated on the original invoices. </para>
                        <para>If our Federal Parliament had imposed a retrospective tax of this sort there would have been a tremendous outcry against such a {flaring injustice, but because it was done by a secret junta of private financiers we took injustice lying down. </para>
                        <para>Further, this impost increased our overseas liabilities on overseas loans to such an extent that it increased the cost of the running of the New South Wales railways by &#163;3,000 per day. All the proceeds of this absolutely illegal and unconstitutional tax went into private hands, and not one penny of it reached the public treasury. </para>

                    <para class="block">Of all the disgraceful things which have been permitted in this country, the levying of the exchange rate stands preeminent. We are now asked not only to legalize that robbery, but also, because of it, to authorize the Government to lay profane hands on this country&#39;s secondary industries. The difficulty confronting Australia is not different from that which confronts every other country. The Government lacks both the knowledge to understand, and the courage to face, the real issue, which is that the old order is passing, and a new order is emerging. </para>

                    <para>I admit that, when thinking of the Ottawa agreement, I am filled with a certain unholy  glee.  I was sufficiently prophetic to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> and other trusting innocents, when the agreement was under consideration in this Parliament, just how disaster would overtake the primary producers as a result of it. My prediction has been borne out by the facts. There is published in England, a journal called the <inline font-style="italic">News Letter,</inline> which is the official mouthpiece of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald, the man who deserted his life-long political faith in order to establish an administration grandiloquently called the National Government. This journal hails the Australian budget as a welcome sign of improvement in the Commonwealth, and emphasizes that the reduction of duties was due to the Ottawa pact. Therefore, the journal maintains, they were the result of British policy, and the hope is expressed that the further reductions promised at Ottawa would soon he effected, now that the Australian economic &#39;position is improving. That passage which, having been published, in the journalistic mouthpiece of the British Prime Minister, must be accepted as authoritative, makes abundantly clear how Australia was betrayed by its Tory representatives! at Ottawa. It shows that the breaking down of the tariff walls, so disastrous to Australian industries enjoying protection under Labour&#39;s beneficent regime, was dictated from Downing-street, and expresses the hope in terms which may be accepted as a mandatory declaration to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> and his team of anti-Australian Ministers, that further breaches are imminent. 1 desire now to quote an article published in that respectable and conservative organ, the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier Mail,</inline> referring to the iniquitous proposals that Australia, with its population of 6,500,000 people, should restrict its exports. Honorable senators  opposite  never tire of telling us that this country depends for its prosperity on its exportable surplus; yet the Mother Country now tells its innocent but trusting children that they must restrict their exports, although she knows that if they do the primary producers must suffer. The article to which I refer states - </para>

                    <para class="block">In referring to these matters I am not concerned with party politics, hut am moved by my life-long faith that competitive commercialism destroys all that is worth while in life. I believe that the economic system known as capitalism is passing, and we of the Labour party are doing our best to hasten its passing, and to establish in its place a more humane and workable system.  Honorable senators opposite were anxious to know the sources from which I was quoting, and I hope they are now convinced that I have gone for my information only to the most conservative and reliable journals. In proof of this, I propose now to quote from the monthly summary issued by the National Bank of Australasia, in which publication reference is made to the World Economic Conference at London. We on this side of the Senate said before the conference opened, that it was foredoomed to failure, because every government of the 66 nations represented hoped to wring some advantage for itself from the conference at the expense of other countries. In a game of that kind, as in a game of poker, every one cannot win. The circular of the National Bank states - </para>

                            <para>- Anything which I say in this chamber goes into the official record, and may be quoted against me in the future. So far, none of my prophecies have been falsified. I make the present prophecy in regard to the American experiment, not because I possess more knowledge on the subject than is readily available to other honorable senators, but because I have the capacity - which they apparently have not - of making a world survey of events, and of recognizing essentials. The experiment in America will be a complete and dismal failure, because it is an attempt by their courageous  President  to save capitalism, which cannot be saved. If honorable senators had had the same extensive political education that I have had, they would know that the  President  of the United States of America would not be allowed to continue his experiment for one day more if it were really thought by those in control of affairs in that country that there was any prospect of his solving the existing economic problems. The fact is that capitalism is afraid of revolution, and is willing to submit to the President&#39;s experiment in an attempt to stave it off. In this country, also, governments should beware of how far they go. They will not need to go much further in the direction of sacrificing Australian industries, which alone can keep our people employed - and even the primary industries, according to lugubrious senators of the Country party are doomed to extinction - before the crowd outside which, because of the bitter experience of hunger and unemployment, is thinking more deeply than it ever thought before, will take affairs into its own hands. When the crowd sickens of the tilings done in the name of democracy and constitutional government we shall see representative institutions supplanted by a dictatorship of either blood-hungry Communists or power-mad fascists. </para>

I stated earlier that there is no difference between the problem which has impelled the Government to introduce this futile measure and that facing every other country to-day. What is that problem? We have to find a new method of distributing the wealth which the world produces. In the language of the political faith to which I subscribe, the production and distribution of wealth must be for the use and benefit of all the people, and not for the private use or profit of any individual or section of the people. This measure is simply a corollary of others of a similar nature which have preceded it. They are not even mentally decent attempts to come to grips with the real problem, and the Government is merely fiddling, as Nero is alleged to have fiddled while Rome burned. I plead with honorable senators who propose to support the bill to realize what its final application means. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> admits that it does not go so far as he would like it to go, although it means a further reduction of customs duties, which he alleges will &#34;be to the advantage of primary producers. If it means anything at all, it means a reduction of the protection afforded to the manufacturing industries of this nation, which, according to the figures I quoted earlier, were in 1931-32 responsible for the production of &#163;281,500,000 worth of wealth. This is the source from which Australia derives its comparative greatness. It is into the vitals of the manufacturing industries of this nation that this Government proposes to thrust the knife. I can only trust that honorable senators who propose to support the bill will, even at this late hour, stay their hands. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator did not tackle the problems which this bill is intended to solve. In his usual delightful way, and with the assistance of a good vocabulary, he voiced certain theories, but failed to come to grips with the purpose of the bill. If the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes),</inline> who appears to be perturbed with the state of Australia&#39;s trade balance, studies the latest return issued by the Commonwealth Statistician, only yesterday, he will see that our trade position overseas is particularly satisfactory. He also said that the enactment of this measure would lead to a further reduction of the protection afforded to Australian industries, and that, in turn, would inevitably result in increased unemployment. If the honorable senator studies the position he will find that, with one exception, there has been a continual decrease in the percentage of unemployed in Australia since this Government has been in office. The position to-day is better than it has been for a considerable time, and we believe that with the passage of legislation such as we are now considering it will steadily improve. The Leader of the Opposition also said that the formula which the </para>

                <para class="block">Tariff Board bad supplied for the assistance of Parliament and of the Government &#34;was inconclusive. I have alreadyplaced concrete cases based on the formula at the disposal of honorable senators. Notwithstanding the suggestions&#39; of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> that this measure is a blind stab in the dark, it will not have an adverse effect upon Australian industries. He contends that by adopting the recommendations of the Tariff Board the protective incidence of the tariff will be reduced. The protection of secondary industries is provided for in the tariff schedules which .embody the fiscal policy of the Government and which have been adopted by Parliament. When our credit overseas slumped this protection, was increased by the high rate of exchange. Does the honorable senator suggest that in addition to the protection already afforded to Australian industries a further 25 per cent, should be given ? I showed yesterday how the Tariff Board bus balanced the position between Australian industries purchasing raw materials overseas and those which are not compelled to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> suggested that the enactment of this legislation will lead to an increase of imports and the destruction of Australian manufacturing industries. He also said that the object of the measure is to placate the members of the Country party and other supporters who do not approve of the Government&#39;s fiscal policy in its entirety. The Tariff Board has indicated from time to time that in making recommendations to the Government with respect to customs duties, it has been embarrassed by the high rate of exchange. &#62; The Government considered for some time whether or not it should refer this intricate problem to economists, or remit it to the Tariff Board. Finally it decided to entrust the task to the board, and I am glad to know that Professor Giblin, whose opinion has been quoted by some honorable senators this afternoon, agrees with the Government that the board is the appropriate tribunal. </para>

                    claimed that there was no justification for the bill. If he will turn to page 56 of the board&#39;s report, he will find that Professor Giblin recommended legislation on the lines of the measure now before the Senate as being in the best interests of Australia. The honorable senator also fell into at least one pitfall. He stated that the maximum reduction of the rate of duty under this proposal would be 20 per cent., whereas it cannot fall below 12&#163; per cent.

                        <para>- An interjection of that sort might be appropriate in an address at street corners, but in a chamber like this, where we are endeavouring to do serious work, it is, I suggest, out of place, if not offensive. Evidently the honorable senator does not like any proposal designed to deal justly with importing and exporting interests. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> complained because the Tariff Board in its first recommendation suggested that a deduction should be made from the duty payable of one or other of the amounts mentioned in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">h. &#34;</inline> whichever is the smaller.&#34; This proposal, I assure the honorable, gentleman, is customary in legislation of this nature. He would prefer Parliament to have a free hand. Being a revenue  tariffist  the honorable senator is not satisfied with the present generous concession, but like Oliver Twist, is asking for more. He has had circulated an amendment which the Government cannot accept. He complains that the Government has not accepted the recommendations of the Tariff Board in their entirety. Yesterday I endeavoured to explain that, if the Government had done so, it  would have been obliged to extend the formula to include the United States of America and Ger- many, countries whose currencies are on a sterling basis. The Government is resolved to stand by the principles of the British preferential tariff, and will not extend them. But the effect of the honorable senator&#39;s amendment would bo more serious than would appear at first sight. It would cut across the Commonwealth&#39;s obligations under the Ottawa agreement. This is best illustrated by quoting a specific example. On a protected line of goods, the duties on which are 40 per cent. British and 60 per cent, general, there is a margin of 20 per cent. in conformity with the formula adopted at the Ottawa Conference in respect of commodities in this range. If the amendment were passed, the result would be that one-quarter&#39; of the duty, oroneeighth of the value for duty, whichever is the less, would be deducted. This would mean that protected goods imported from the United Kingdom would be dutiable at 40 per cent., less exchange adjustment 10 per cent., making the net duty 30 per cent. Protected goods im-  ported from the United States of America would be dutiable at 60 per cent., thus preserving the margin of 20 per cent., but after deducting12&#189; per cent. exchange adjustment, the net duty would be 47&#189; per cent., and the margin would be reduced to17&#189; per cent. As the margin under the Ottawa agreement in these duty ranges is 20 per cent., the amendment would be a breach of the agreement. If there are in the bill any other obscure points which I have not elucidated, 1 shall be glad to do so in committee. </para>
