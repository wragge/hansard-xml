                        <para>The Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) said to-day that his attention had been called to a statement that the Country party in December, 1931, had refused to enter the Commonwealth Government because of its tariff policy, or some alteration in the tariff policy of the leaders of the United Australia party. This statement, said Mr. Lyons, has only recently been made. The claim was never suggested at the time. The persistence in the mis-statement fortunately does not make it true. </para>

Yesterday, I released to the press a statement in connexion with this subject; but it had relation only to the earlier tests which took place before those referred to in the recent cabled advice. This matter is receiving the closest attention of the Government. </para>

                        <para>. - I have spoken so often on the subject of tariffs, and always to the same effect, that a re-statement of my views should be unnecessary, but I feel that were I to remain silent on. this occasion the reasons for my silence would probably be misconstrued, and I would be placed in a false position. I made my first speech in advocacy of protection in a debating society in Victoria when I was sixteen years of age, and the many intervening years have only served to confirm me in the opinions I then expressed. I can truthfully say that my fiscal faith has never faltered. I have kept the faith, and I hope that, according to my ability, I have fought a good fight in what I believe to be a righteous cause. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>We are considering this problem at a time when a state of economic uncertainty prevails throughout the world. A great conference is now being held in London, which may or may not have important results. In any case, that gathering has the good wishes of everybody concerned for the welfare of the world, and grievous disappointment will be felt if it fails to find a solution for some of the difficulties which are confronting us. </para>
                    <para>I am not one of those who blame tariffs for the unfortunate position in which the world finds itself. I believe that the root cause is much deeper and more general ; that tariffs are the effect and  not  the cause of many of our troubles. One of the purposes of the Economic Conference that is at present being held in London is to secure a reduction of tariffs and the removal of the restrictionson world trade. Although most of the countries of the world are represented at this conference, so far only Great Britain and the United States of America have made public expressions of opinion on the subject, to the effect that they hope that the convention will be the means of finding a market for their products. </para>
                    <para>Protective tariffs are not new to Australia. For some years prior to federation, Victoria had enjoyed the benefits of a protectionist policy, and it is apparent that, when the Constitution was being framed by the different conventions, and was subsequently submitted to the State parliaments and the people, a protectionist policy for the Commonwealth was in contemplation. There is no clearer evidence of that than the provision in the Constitution which provided for the retention by Western Australia of the control for a period of duties imposed upon commodities imported by that State. As I have always understood it, the purpose of that provision was to enable Western Australia to establish secondary industries within its boundaries, so that it would be in a position to compete successfully with the products of other States. It cannot be said that Western Australia took appreciable advantage of the opportunity then presented to it, with the result that for many years that State has opposed the policy of protection which a majority of the people of the other States have favoured. </para>

                    <para>I hope that the results of the Economic Conference which is being held in London will be more favorable to Australia than were those achieved at Ottawa, from which convention we entertained high hopes. I repeat what I have said previously, that I do not blame our representatives who attended the Ottawa Conference for the unsatisfactory results that were obtained. Experience has led me to form the opinion that Great Britain drove a hard bargain with Australia, and that we have not obtained the benefits which we were led to believe would accrue from the agreement which was approved by our representatives, and subsequently ratified by this Parliament. Whether it was a result of that agreement or not, after the pact had been entered into the prices of the products which it principally affects - wheat, meat and butter - fell to lower levels than those which had obtained for years previously. </para>

                            <para>- Wool has been sold at a price which, we are told, does not pay the growers, proving my contention that it is a buyer's market so far as that commodity is concerned, just as it is with regard towheat, butter, meat and other products. For months past we have read in our newspapers that there has been keen competition at the wool sales held in Australia, and that prices are rising. Yet, strangely enough, the average price of wool appears to remain at about the same level. </para>

                            <para>- Only for odd clips. It is significant that for some months the average price per bale of wool has' not been disclosed by the wool brokers. The Australian wool industry is in its present unfortunate position largely because the buyers have organized to fix prices at a low level. The producers of wool are not wholly blameless. The position was as bad, if not worse, in 1920, when Bawra was established, and when there was a surplus of about 3,000,000 bales of wool. Through the instrumentality of Bawra the producers of wool obtained control of the market and fixed a basic price, as a result of which they waxed fat and dissolved Bawra. They have since repented at leisure. As a result of the wool-broking firms now having assumed control of the position, neither Bawra nor any other selling organization has been formed. It has been mentioned several times during the first and second-reading debates on the tariff that, while the prices of. primary commodities have fallen to unpayable levels, those of goods produced by secondary industries remain comparatively high. After giving the matter a good deal of thought I have arrived at the conclusion that the reason is that the prices of our land products are controlled by the buyers, while those of the products of our secondary industries are, to a large extent, controlled by the manufacturers. The consensus of opinion is that there can be no change in the world prices for primary commodities unless prices or the volume of production are controlled by central authorities. I know that some honorable senators object to Government interference of any kind. A few days ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> referred to the faulty marketing of our butter, for which he blamed the Government, and expressed the opinion that our butter should be put up and sold in Great Britain in pats. Almost in his next sentence the honorable senator objected strongly to any Government interference or control of business. It seems to me that those two statements are incompatible. I am a firm believer in reciprocal trade. I consider that, if everything be taken into account, our purchases from Great Britain are equal to her purchases fromus. Until recently, </para>

                    <para>Great Britain's purchases from Australia have been chiefly of commodities upon which no preference was given, such as wheat, wool, and butter; the goods that we exported had to compete on equal terms with "the products of other countries. </para>
                    <para>In dealing with the volume of our trade with Great Britain, I propose to advance what I believe to be an entirely new contention; that is, that the many millions of pounds that we pay every year to British bondholders by way of interest, ought to be included in the figures relating to our trade with the Mother Country. In my opinion, money is a commodity, and ought to be treated as such. We have purchased the use of over £500,000,000, and when we discharge our interest commitment, we pay for a commodity in the same sense as when we pay for the goods that we import. </para>

                            <para>- That, I believe, is imminent. I cannot see how the British bondholders can refuse the request for a reasonable reduction of interest. I was astonished to learn that the Chancellor of the British Exchequer had objected to- the flotation of a substantial conversion loan. I could have understood an objection to a proposal to raise new money; but a conversion would simply be from one rate of interest to another, and comparatively little money would change hands. </para>

                            <para>- That would mean the release of the amount which the new money replaced. In the aggregate, the sum available in Great Britain for other purposes would not be lessened, because the one would balance the other. The position in regard to money borrowed in Australia is quite different from that in regard to money borrowed overseas, ' because the local lenders are, for the most part, heavily taxed to provide the interest on their own money, whereas we can levy no taxation whatever on the £30,000,000 that we pay annually to our creditors overseas, where the interest rate varies from 5 per cent, to 6-£ per cent. In the present position of the money market of the world, such interest rates are extortionate, and, in common fairness, they ought to be promptly reduced without the slightest demur. I read in the press recently statements by the ex- Agent-General for Victoria, and Professor Wallace, of the Sydney University, from which I gathered that the people of Australia are most unpopular in Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- So were their cricketers when in Australia. Why should we be unpopular in Great Britain '? I believe it is largely because of the character of the men who have represented Australia in London. I was pleased indeed to read recently , that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> had put in a good word for Australia and Australians. I. hope that whoever may represent Australia in London in the future, will be a thorough-going Australian, who will not be afraid to speak on our behalf at every opportunity. Professor Wallace says that it would be to the advantage of this country if we had a better opinion of ourselves. I think so, too. I have, heard many adverse opinions in regard to Australia expressed during the debate on this measure,, especially in regard to our manufacturers - their equipment, their methods, even their character. I had the opportunity, while associated for a couple of years with the Department of Trade and Customs, of meeting many manufacturers in Sydney, Melbourne and other centres. The opinion that I formed from personal contact was, that they are all honorable men, who are rendering a great service to Australia, and ave worthy of our confidence and commendation. The position to-day is, that hundreds of thousands of our people are unemployed. But things are no worse in Australia than elsewhere, and our chances of recovery are better than those of countries which devote themselves mainly to primary industries. For many years New Zealand was cited as an example of what could be accomplished in a country that depended upon its land products. In the early months of the depression there were those who contrasted the position in Australia with that in our sister dominion, but the general opinion now of those who speak and write with authority, is that conditions are much worse in New Zealand than in Australia, and that her recovery will be more difficult and longer deferred. Prior to the depression, the <inline font-style="italic">per. capita</inline> purchases by New Zealand from Great Britain were the highest in the world. In 1929, they amounted to £14 10s. a head, the Irish Free State coming next, and Australia being in third place. The latest figures relating to New Zealand that I have been able to obtain are for the year 1931, in which her purchases from Great Britain droppedto £8 a head. New Zealand has recently appointed a board to inquire into what new industries may be established to provide work for her unemployed. I am sorry to say that the latest figures show that 60,000 adult male workers are registered as unemployed in that dominion. Its published statistics do not include unemployed women and youths. I am sure that no honorable senator can sec any virtue in unemployment. I hope we have not in this country, as apparently they have in the United States of America, people who think that cheap labour is of advantage to industry. I was interested therefore in an article that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Saturday Evening Post</inline> of the 10th December last, from which I quote the following passage: - </para>

                        <para>The twin sister of the cheap labour myth is that which demands a considerable permanent floating supply of idle workers. According to this latter belief, industry cannot flourish unless there are constantly so many idle hands that those who do have jobs can be hold down to low wages through fear of being turned off and ofbeing replaced by others, whose necessity is so great that they think any wage is better than none at all. Beliefs such as this have made a few men rich, and many men poor. Private greed of this sort always creates a public debt that some one must pay. A few for the time may win; society in the long run always loses. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am confident that our experience confirms that statement.

That statement reveals a serious condition of affairs. I learnt recently from a Melbourne newspaper that a number of University students with Engineering Degrees were working as" labourers at Iron Knob, in South Australia, and that a number of others with Arts Degrees were learning shorthand and typing in the hope of being able to obtain casual employment. That shows how every class of society, and every section of the community, is affected materially and morally by the present position, and it shows us the danger with which we are likely to be faced unless we solve the problem of unemployment and put our people to useful work. It is regrettable that a great many of our citizens who hold responsible positions appear to be more concerned about finding employment for men and women in Bradford, Sheffield, Glasgow and other industrial centres overseas than they are about providing employment for the workers of our own country. It has been urged time and again that in imposing, protectionist duties we need to be careful lest we offend the authorities and citizens of other countries, but I do not think that any other country, in framing its tariff, considers whether offence may be given to us. When Great Britain proposed to change over from freetrade to protection, a number of countries protested, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Runciman,</inline> on behalf of the British Government, answered those protests in a speech which he made in Rome.

                    <para class="block">We should follow the example of Great Britain. We, as a people, have tremendous responsibilities. We have a greatcountry, capable of supporting a large population in comfort, and we should not fail in our obligations as a nation. Some persons contend that Australia cannot, support a population of more than about 20,000,000; but such a contention is ridiculous. I am satisfied that Australia can easily support a population of 100,000,000. Our population can be limited only by the quantity of food and raw materials that we are capable of producing, and that quantity is considerably greater than has been previously estimated. Take the position of Italy under the dictatorship of Mussolini. That country is comparatively small, and a great part of its area is not arable; yetlast year it produced 275,000,000 bushels of wheat, or double its production of only a few years ago. The annual consumption of wheat in Italy is 300,000,000 bushels, and at one time that country had to import more than half of its requirements. It is now probable tha', within a year or two Italy will be able to supply the whole of its requirements of wheat. Something of that nature is taking place in almost every country of the world, including Great Britain. Speaking in the House of Commons a few months ago on the question of unemployment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald said that Great Britain would have to look for the solution of its unemployment problem more to the land than it had hitherto done. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George said that instead of paying the dole to people capable of working on farms thb Government should subsidize farmers who were willing' to employ them. According to statistics, the area of land under agriculture in Great Britain to-day is 3,000,000 acres less than it was a few years ago; so we can realize the possibility in that country of a vast increase of primary production, with a consequent restriction of the market upon which wo chiefly depend. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and over 5,000,000 head of cattle. Every European country is endeavouring to produce its own foodstuffs. France at one time was a large importer of wheat, but last year its production exceeded its consumption. It is very evident that we shall stand on the brink of national disaster if we attempt to depend solely or even chiefly upon our primary production. It has been contended that high protective duties tend to increase prices, and the match industry has been quoted as an example. I understand that the offence of the match companies was that they charged 2d. per gross of boxes more than was considered a fair price,- and that the price has now been reduced, to that extent. I do not know whether matches are cheaper than they were. </para>

                            <para>- If they are not cheaper, the extra profit which the manufacturers previously made is now being absorbed by the distributors. It has been proved that the whole of the excess profit of the match companies was expended on the extension of their premises and equipment. We have been, in the habit of comparing the price in Australia with that charged by the great match combine of Europe, but recently we learnt that that combine was able to sell matches cheaply only because of the fact that its principals had defrauded the people of Europe of £100,000,000. So black was the case against these men that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Kreuger  committed suicide, another principal fell- out of an aeroplane while it was crossing from England to France, and a third- was recently sentenced to twenty years' penal servitude. There has been circulated as an example of exorbitant duties a leaflet entitled <inline font-style="italic">Mystic or Tinsel Mitt.</inline> This article is part of. the ordinary kitchen equipment, and I made it. my business to inquire into the effect upon its price of the allegedly high duty. I was told that those purchased for use in my own home, when they first came on to the market, were bought at 8d. a piece. Later the price was reduced to 6d., but when the increased duty was imposed, and the article was made in Australia, the price fell first to 4d., and then to 3d., or five for ls. My experience has been that, when manufacture of an article begins in Australia, the price is immediately reduced to less than that at which it had been previously imported. The other day I had occasion to buy a chemical preparation which I use. I asked the chemist for it, and when he handed it to me he said " ls. 6d., please." I said " Is this the same article for which I used to pay 2s. 6d., and is the 'bottle the same size? " " Oh, yes," he said "it is exactly the same in every respect." "Why, then," I asked, "has the' price been so greatly reduced?" He replied that the article used to be imported from America, but that now i't was made in Australia. I think it is the experience of most of us with regard to a great many articles that,' since importations were excluded under the high tariff imposed in the schedule that has now been partly withdrawn, and manufacturers felt that -they were assured of the Australian market, prices have come down, and we have kept money in the country to the benefit of every one, producers and consumers alike. </para>

                            <para>- I did not say that it applied in all cases; it has applied in very many cases, and sometimes, when prices have been increased in Australia, they have increased also overseas. There has been a marked change in public opinion on this matter recently. Many business people, and some of the leading business houses, are now boasting that most of what they sell is of Australian manufacture. Recently, the  chairman  of directors of Buckley and Nunn, Melbourne, stated at the annual meeting of shareholders that originally they had been an importing firm, and most of the good's they sold were procured overseas. . At the time of when he was speaking, however, just a few months ago, 70 per cent. of . the goods sold by the firm were made in Australia, and only 30 per cent, were imported. I do not think that I am wrong in saying that Buckley and Nunn are noted for the high quality of the goods they sell. We all know something of such establishments as Woolworth's and Coles. It is the boast of Woolworth's that over 70 per cent, of what they sell is made in Australia, and we know what an infinite variety of commodities they stock. This must of necessity mean a great deal of employment for our people, and we should hesitate before we do anything in the least calculated to supplant Australian products by imported goods. Such action must lead to industrial, economic, and - what may concern some of us - political disaster. I do not want to see the fiery cross raised accompanied by slogans such as " Work for the Workless ", and " Australian Goods for Australian Markets ". </para>

                    <para>The Ottawa agreement has changed very materially our relations with the Mother Country. Previously, those relations rested to a very great extent on a sentimental basis, but now they rest  on a business basis, and there is a very general feeling in Australia that such a basis is not satisfactory to us. I hope that I am a loyal Britisher; I think and feel that I am, and I should regret exceedingly if anything were done which would strain our relations with the Mother Country. We must remember, however, that the percentage of Australianborn is becoming greater every year, and, therefore, the population of this country is becoming more Australian and less English, Scotch or Irish. That is a factor which has to be taken into account when we consider what the future holds for us. Owing to that change in the composition of our population, we are more likely to resent any unfair treatment whether in our business, in our politics, or even in our sports. I am convinced that the only safe policy for Australia is selfcontainment so far as is possible. No country can be entirely self-contained, but scarcely any other country can be so self-contained as Australia, because we can produce somewhere in this island contitent practically everything we need. We have every class of soil, every productive range of climate, and our people have abilities equal to those of the people of any other country on the globe. </para>
                    <para>I know that in this connexion a special plea has been made for what are called the weaker States. They are weaker only because their populations are smaller than those of the three eastern mainland States. If those three eastern mainland States had formed a federation excluding the other three, they would have had a bigger population to-day, that we have in our "six States. They have so much in common that they could have agreed upon a policy which would have been in every respect satisfactory to all. In my opinion, South Australia has very little to complain of, certainly less than has either of the other two States - Tasmania and Western Australia. I remind honorable senators that South Australia gave to this Parliament <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .Kingston,</inline> one of the staunchest protectionists that we have ever had. The position of Tasmania is different from that of Western Australian and South Australia. In the first place, it is separated from the mainland, and, in the second, its area is small, and much of it, though beautiful to look upon, is unproductive. I do not think that any disabilities have been imposed on Tasmania by federation, but the people of that State are few, and we of the mainland are many. The obligation of the many to help the few is very strong, and I arn sure it is one which will not be shirked. I do think that Tasmania has u claim for a better shipping service, and it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to see that the shipping companies, which are protected by the Navigation Act, provide a proper service to Tasmania. </para>

Whenever one wanted to refer to extreme freetraders, one spoke of the Manchester school. Yet it was the Manchester Chamber of Commerce which led the way in asking the British Government to introduce a policy of protection for Great Britain. That was followed by requests by the London and Liverpool Chambers of Commerce. Prior to that, the members of the British section attending the conference of the International Chambers of Commerce held at Washington last year reported when they returned that the only way to establish trade equilibrium was by the imposition of customs duties or prohibitions against importations.

                            <para>- The honorable senator should ask himself that question. I should be sorry to say or do anything which would lay me open to that accusation. I feel that I am a citizen  of  a country which is at least  potentially  great. I have a good opinion of Australia, and of the Australian people, and I am anxious to serve this country, and also to serve my fellow citizens, but I think that that can best be done by establishing industries in .Australia, and maintaining, those industries already established, in order to give employment to our own people. If that were done it would make Australia a better market for  Britsh  producers than it is at present. An impoverished country is  of no  use to its own citizens or to- the pf  to  nlc of any country who wish to trade with it. I believe that the policy of freetrade would impoverish this country, and destroy the market which at present exists for British goods. </para>

                    </continue><para>I have lived most of my life in country districts. I was brought up on a mixed farm in Victoria, upon which we produced almost everything required for table use. We lived particularly well; hut the people of to-day are not prepared to live in the same way as did the small farmers 50 or 60 years ago. During recent years many millions have been spent - much of which has been wasted - by the Commonwealth and the States in settling people on small areas. To endeavour to settle a large number of persons on the land in the present economic condition of this and other countries can be attended only by disastrous results. The opinion is held in some circles that any one can become a successful farmer; but that is an opinion which I do not share. A man must be instinctively fond of farming, or he will never succeed in rural work. I have never known of a person who thought farming work irksome become a successful farmer. I am afraid that, if more people are diverted from the cities to the country, they will become a greater burden on the State than they are at present. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I know that they do. I speak from experience. I have been living amongst those engaged in farming, and I submit that they do not fail because they are unable to obtain reasonable credit. I have known more to fail because credit was too easily obtainable than because it was difficult to secure. In the crisis through which I hope we have, passed, the banks have been ever ready to help those whom they felt they could safely assist. There are many aspects of this subject with which I have not dealt; but I trust that in considering this measure .every honorable senator, regardless of his  political  beliefs, will realize that his first duty is to Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The working class - a class of which I am not ashamed if the honorable senator is. The policy of new protection is embodied in the Labour party's platform ; in fact, it is one of its chief planks. I recognize that tariffs are mere palliatives in the class struggle, and that in. Australia they can take us only a certain distance along the road to the real objective of the Labour party; but it is from that angle that I wish to debate this measure, and I believe that my views will be supported by other Labour senators and the loaders of the Labour movement throughout Australia, whose objective is the emancipation of the workers. What we are up against to-day is the power of the press. In the main, our newspapers arc published for profit, and not for use, and until such time as these press dope machines are prepared to tell the truth to the workers we cannot expect to .make much progress. When I refer to the workers I include, not only those engaged in the mines, factories and fields, out also the great mass of people- who have to work for a livelihood. It is true that there are certain doctors of law in Australia who have not a clear conception of the purpose of an instrument used as a political or industrial palliative, and of it's effect upon that large body of workers who are marching along the road to their emancipation. In the main, the people of Australia find that they have a very hard row to hoe. Of course, we have our friends the doctors of law in all the States. </para>

                        <para>. -  We may assume that the tariff schedule now before us will be the only one of any size that will be tabled by, this Government during the lii &amp; of this  Parliament,  for the period for which the Parliament was elected has nearly half expired. Minor  alteration*  of duties may be made in schedules that will be tabled later; but this schedule will, undoubtedly, be the main tariff product of this Government. It is, therefore, incumbent upon honorable senator* to consider whether it gives adequate expression to the tariff policy put forward by supporters of the Government during the last election campaign. In  my  opinion it does not, and one of  the  strongest arguments in support of  that  opinion is that the items which elicited the. greatest interest and provoked  the  keenest debate when the schedule was before another place, were those relating  to  matches and tobacco, the production of neither of which, by any stretch of the imagination, can be regarded as essential to the community, or looked to for the promotion of prosperity in our primary industries. </para>

                    <para>Before proceeding to discuss the schedule, I wish to recapitulate, briefly, the general attitude of the great men of this and other countries towards high tariffs. By quoting the views of leading economists and publicists outside Australia, I do not desire it tq be assumed that I think all the great men are necessarily outside Australia - indeed, I shall quote some Australians. . But the tariff views that have been expressed in the last few years by outstanding men, some of whom have visited Australia, should be worthy of our careful consideration. There can be no doubt that the opinion is widely held among people who are qualified to speak with authority that </para>

I do not intend to make  a  historical disquisition of our tariff history from the inception of  federation - it would be too lamentable a story from my own point of view.

                            <para>- That is true. Tariffs here and elsewhere have gone much higher since that time. I do not suggest that tariffs alone are responsible for the condition in which we find ourselves to-day; but it is instructive to realize that many of the countries now calling for a downward revision of tariffs were formerly highly protectionist. I refer honorable senators also to the report of the British Economic Mission, though I shall not quote from it in detail. It will be remembered that the conclusionsof that body were, briefly, that the Australian tariff had been pushed probably to its farthest economic point. In 1929, an investigation of the tariff was made by Professors Brigden, Copland and Giblin, and Messrs. Dyason and Wickens, and their findings were published in the book, <inline font-style="italic">Tha Australian Tariff.</inline> These five scientists approached the consideration of the subject more tolerantly than most of the other investigating bodies had done, and endeavoured to come to a sound economic decision. While I shall not quote extensively from their book, I think the following extracts are not an unfair statement of their opinion: - </para>

                    <para class="block">Had <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer's advice been followed to a. greater extent and in greater detail, Australia would be in a better position than she is in to-day. I shall refer only briefly to the annual reports made by the Tariff Board, especially in 1931 and 1932, iu which it is stated, in effect, that the attempts to build up inefficient industries by enormous duties tend to encourage the adoption of retaliatory measures by other countries. I shall say something more oil this point later. Those reports embody the views of men who are not in any way antagonistic to the development of secondary industries in Australia. But these men felt compelled to point to the abuse of the tariff system. Their criticism will require a good deal more answering than has been given so far. I also direct the attention of honorable senators to the views of certain prominent publicists. I suppose the two outstanding books which have been written on Australia during the last three or four years are <inline font-style="italic">Australia,</inline> by Professor Hancock, and <inline font-style="italic">The Economic History of Australia,</inline> by Professor Shann. These two books are being read in every part of the world, and are likely to continue to be read. The conclusion of both writers is undoubtedly hostile to the present exaggerated and inflated tariffs. I shall not quote extensive extracts to support this statement, but the following remark in Professor Shann's book, which deals with the post-war era, is interesting: - </para>

                    <para>Opinion of the leaders of thought in Australia, and throughout the world - speaking apart from politics - is to the effect that the tariff war has become a general menace, as, indeed, I believe it to be", not only to trade, but also to world peace. When. I say this, I am rather diffident about giving my own views on these matters, having regard to the talents of the men whose opinions I have already quoted. Nevertheless, it is the duty of a member of Parliament to come to his own conclusions. I am speaking as one who for many years has been a reasonable  tariffist. I  know that the word "reasonable " will be cavilled at, and that a definition will be . sought ; but I have always believed that it is not desirable that Australia should be entirely filled with primary producers. We should have our industries reasonably and widely distributed. We should not adopt the line that we are simply to produce primary products and raw materials for use overseas, and not manufacture any of them in our own country. </para>
                    <para>I shall give a number of reasons why I am opposed to high tariffs in general, and why I consider that the present tariff, in particular, is altogether too high. In the first place, it seems to me that Australia's tariff is not fair to the Mother Country. 1 always approach' the tariff question remembering that, in the last resort, we are dependent for our very existence on the great country from which we have sprung, and on the force which it has had for so long, and which it knows so well- no country, indeed, knows better - how to use as a means, not of offence, but of defence. Only the other day we had word that five vessels of a destroyer flotilla had been lent to us by Great Britain, thereby saving us the expense of providing ourselves with similar vessels out of capital. That loan was welcome, and it was spoken of as a generous act on the part of Britain.I suggest that it is not sufficient to talk of generosity, because such an action on one side deserves response of a similar nature on the other. I think that this tariff schedule is not in agreement with the spirit of the Ottawa Conference. I am not saying for the moment that it is not in accord with the letter of the Ottawa agreement. That contention can, and, no doubt, will, be advanced later; but I remind honorable senators that, when our delegates went to Ottawa, they said they were not in a position to come to any definite arrangement as to details, so far as their country was concerned, and the eventual result was that Great Britain made a number of concessions in regard to individual items. We, on our side, entered into a sort of general agreement which is set out in writing for the sake of convenient reference, but, in itself, is so general that it may, and probably does, lend itself to differing interpretations. In other words, some of the concessions that we obtained were in the nature of extensions of the ranges of goods to which the British preference applied, and others were in the nature of increases of the preference. We pledged ourselves to adhere to certain general principles, and I suggest that it is idle, in these circumstances, for us to say, " We consider that, under the agreement, we have done what is a fair thing." The very fact that these arrangements were so general throws upon us the responsibility of showing that we are really giving Great Britain a fair deal. If we do not do so, the inevitable result will be a certain amount of criticism, in not only the British Parliament, but also the British press, which is, indeed, already being heard. It is not likely that the British Government will make a public statement that, in its opinion, we have failed to perform our part of this agreement; but we shall probably find that it will be impossible, or, at least, exceedingly difficult, to renew it, let alone extend its scope in the future. I deplore the habit, which I notice iscommon, of looking up an article of this agreement, and saying, " We consider that what we are now doing is in accord with article so and so of the agreement." What we have to do is to show that we have carried out the agreement in such a way that, taken by and large, we have given Britain a fair deal. </para>
                    <para>By our tariff we have provoked a rather marked hostility on the part of foreign nations. It is unnecessary, I suppose, to go into details concerning the resentment to which it has given rise in France and Germany, and of the retaliatory measures to which those countries have resorted. Nor, probably, need I refer to the fact that Belgium is not altogether pleased, for instance, with our attitude to its glass. I suggest that we should take the trouble to look up the statistics, and find out whether we are not exportingto countries such as Belgium, Japan and New Zealand - as, of course, we are - a great deal more than they are sending to us. In 1930-31, New Zealand exported toAustralia merchandise to the total value of £775,000, but the goods which Australia exported to New Zealand ware worth £2,975,000. Our imports from Japan in that year were worth £2,379,000, but we exported to that country goods to the value of £9,500,000. We purchased from Belgium goods to the value of £312,000, yet we exported to Belgium products worth £4,195,000. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but that fact does not in any way qualify or weaken my argument. What has to be considered is the balance of trade. It seems to me to be the height of unwisdom, where we have such a tremendous balance of trade in our favour, for us to seize an opportunity of levying an embargo, for instance, on potatoes coming from New Zealand, or to put a very high tariff on glass, even to the point of an embargo, against Belgium. In the case of Japan, we have, apparently, so irritated that country, that it was suggested the other day that a restriction might be placed on the entry of our wool into Japan. </para>

                            <para>-HUGHE S. - That is true, and I am not discussing whether that action was justified; but it has resulted in New Zealand imposing an embargo upon Australian oranges., The agitation which was worked up for the exclusion of New Zealand potatoes from Australia was certainly, to a great extent, political. The object was to exclude such potatoes because they were Now Zealand goods, and the balance of trade between the two countries was not taken into account at all.We recently sent a ship to Eastern seas, and to Malaya, for the purpose of trying to extend our markets there; but how can we expect success in that enterprise? The ship visited Java, whose sugar we do not buy, and found half the sugar mills in Java closed. Is it natural to suppose that Java will have kindly feelings towards us? I do not know whether the ship went to Fiji, but I read in the press the other day that great irritation has been occasioned in that country because of the way in which Australia has observed the terms of the Ottawa agreement with respect to bananas. While with our high tariff we are not doing what I regard as a fair thing to the Mother Country, we are, at the same time, following out the hermit policy of which Professor Shann speaks, and estranging ourselves from the goodwill of the world at large. This is mainly because of our tariff. Two or three years ago, I read in the press that a Labour gentleman named Crofts, I believe, had been to Geneva, and that on his return he said that it was extraordinary to notice that everybody there seemed to be antagonistic to Australia. He added that they appeared to be rather pleased than otherwise to hear that this country was in the throes of depression. There must be some reason for this, and I suggest that it is not far to seek. </para>

Clearly he had the impression that we were definitely hostile to a number of European countries. Whether his opinion was based on our attitude to migration, on our White Australia policy, or on our general tariff policy, I am unable to say. </para>

                    <para>Another objection to this high tariff is its serious effect upon the industry of the primary-producing States ; but I shall not dwell upon this aspect of the matter now, because during the last week or two, a good deal has been said about it. Still, we cannot ignore the drift towards secession, which, I am informed, has gathered momentum in my own State, even in the few weeks since the Senate recommenced its sittings. We cannot disregard the fact that population is moving from the smaller and primary-producing States to those States which are benefiting from our tariff legislation, or from government subsidies to an undue extent. To indicate how definite is this movement of population, I may state that the representation of South Australia in the House of Representatives will, probably, be reduced by one member as a result of the forthcoming census, and that additional representation will be given to one of the more powerful and richer eastern States. Any one who wishes to. ascertain to what extent the various States are directly affected by the tariff, need not look further than the report of the Australian tariff economic inquiry which I quoted this morning. In Appendix W of this tariff investigation report, there appear these comments - </para>
                    <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
                        <item label=".">
                            <para>. The effects of the tariff upon different areas, and especially upon the States, are so important that a summary statement is called for . . . The unequal effects between States are probably the most embarrassing consequences of the tariff . . . The established producers in these areas and States have, undoubtedly, been penalized by the tariff. Prom the point of view of the States themselves, the consequences are not less important . . . It is natural that the harmful effects of the tariff should express themselves most acutely as difficulties of State finance . . . </para>
                        </item>

                    <para class="block">The effect of the tariff on States is just as important as its effect on individual industries. Lately, rural industries have been forced to appeal to the Federal Government for some form of assistance, because of the detrimental effect of the tariff. For a similar reason, several State Governments have been practically compelled to ask the Federal Government for what appears to be a favour, but, on the showing of the report from which I have quoted is merely the return of something which has been taken from them by legislative action. </para>
                    <para>Then we have to consider the load on the primary producers, due to the operation of the tariff. South Australia, as honorable senators are well aware, is essentially a primary-producing State, though it is not the only State that depends almost wholly on primary production. I understand that the position of the farmers in western New South "Wales is, if anything, worse than that of the farmers in my own State, and, therefore, their need for assistance is quite as urgent. We may be told that the Commonwealth Government has done a great deal for them. That, no doubt, is partly true, and as I do not wish to look a gift horse in the mouth, I admit that a certain amount of relief has been given. For example, there have been remissions of sales taxation; but mostly, I should say, of a rather small order. There has also been a reduction of the land tax. This is not a negligible concession, but its beneficial effects are felt even more by city  property-holders  than by country landowners, so it cannot be regarded as a special concession to the man on the land who is producing wealth for export'. </para>

                    <para>Then there was the special grant for wheat-growers, over £3,000,000 being provided by the Scullin Administration, and over £2,000,000 last year by the present Government. It is hard to get exact figures dealing with the cost of the tariff to our wheat-farmers, but it works out, possibly, at something like 5d. a bushel; so if the Government gives back to the farmers, in the form of a bounty, <inline font-style="italic">4£d.</inline> a bushel in one year, and 3£d. a bushel in the following year, it cannot be contended that this act of justice, for it is no more than that, puts him in any favoured position. It is only making up to him, partially and temporarily, what has been taken from him permanently, with the possibility of the exactions beingincreased. </para>
                    <para>Is it fair to inflict such liabilities on those who are producing the wealth of this country, forcing them, eventually, to appeal to the Government for exemptions on the ground of hardship? I venture to say that, at the present moment, owing to the tariff, while practically every primary producer in Australia could, with complete justice, claim exemption from some portion of this burden at all events, on the ground of hardship, the majority do not care to exercise their right because of pride, or the possession of a certain amount of capital reserve, or for some other reason. </para>

                    <para>What I should have expected, and what one might reasonably have expected in the circumstances, keeping in mind the knowledge that our manufacturers have presumably been doing very well under the high tariffs imposed in recent years, and hearing in mind also the dreadfully low prices that have been ruling for primary products, was provision in this schedule for relief in respect of the duties on the requirements of primary producers. Even if this provision were of a temporary nature, to operate only during a time of real stress, such as that through which we are now passing, it would have been gratefully acknowledged. If necessary, the secondary industries concerned could have been assisted by some form of bounty. For years past, it has been repeatedly urged that the bounty system as a means to assist industries, is more equitable than an increase of tariff protection, because for one thing, bounty payments are more easily checked. In this tariff, no attempt is made to consider those articles which are required by primary producers, and their chief expense in the production of our export wealth. </para>
                    <para>Then we have to consider the position of the consumers, who have always been, but I hope will not continue to be, unorganized. How does this tariff press on the ordinary consumer and the man on a fixed salary? To indicate more clearly bow it affects such persons, I direct attention to two or three items which, perhaps, are not the most important in the schedule, but, nevertheless, may be regarded as typical examples. Take, for instance, the ad valorem duties of 30 per cent. British, and 40 per cent, general on medicines, pharmaceutical preparations, including pills, tablets, and even medicines for animals! At a time like this, when so many people are in financial difficulties, and are obliged to go to public hospitals for medical attention, is it. fair to impose a high tariff on medicines, even those required for animals? Then there is the duty on perambulators and go-carts. ^ suppose that every mother, unless she has one already, requires a perambulator for her child if it is of tender years. Is it reasonable to impose a tariff on perambulators of £1 each, or an ad valorem duty of 30 per cent. British and 50 per cent, general, whichever rate returns the higher duty? No one will suggest that the manufacture of perambulators is essential to the future welfare of Australia. I agree that the more perambulators there are in use in Australia, the better it will be for this country ; but it is not essential that they should be manufactured here. To show how unbiased I am in this matter, I do not even know where perambulators are made in Australia, and what is more, I do not care. It is a gross injustice to penalize in this way every Australian mother who presents an additional child to this country at a time of such great financial difficulty. </para>
                    <para>I turn now to the duty on rabbit traps. This may not appear to be an important item, but I assure honorable senators that it is by no means unimportant, because I know, from personal experience, that during the last year or two, rabbits have been increasing to such an extent that, in some country districts, they have become a perfect plague. A great many men who are unable to secure employment, not only in country districts, but also in our cities, have quite wisely decided that it is better to go trapping rabbits and selling them than to remain in populous centres, monotonously drawing what has been provided by Governments in the form of sustenance relief. One could mention a number of items, including cotton and. wool textiles, agricultural implements, and boots, on which the duties are too high. At a time when so many people are almost without boots, why is there an ad valorem duty of 45 per pent. upon boots from Britain? That duty should be removed, even if compensation had to be given <inline font-style="italic">hi</inline> some other way. I am not advocating a radical scrapping of duties; but I say that the Government would be justified in suspending the tariff on the things which the primary producer requires, even if that meant paying a bounty to keep certain manufacturing firms going. An ad valorem duty of 45 per cent, on boots is absurd. I have already mentioned some of the classes of persons who do not benefit from the high duties. Who does benefit from them? It may be said that the manufacturers and their employees reap advantage from a high tariff, and, therefore, it is only right that we should consider what part they play in the community. That can be calculated adequately only by ascertaining what they add to our common wealth by their exports. </para>

                    <para>I shall not weary the Senate by quoting a lot of figures; but I point out that, in 1913, Australia's exports of primary products were valued at £73,000,000, compared with less than £2,500,000 in the case of manufactured products. Seventeen years later - in 1930-31- the respective values were £86,750,000 and under £3,500,000. During the ten years from 1920-21 to 1929-30, agricultural products comprised 24½ per cent., pastoral products 52 per cent., and manufactured products 3½ per cent. of our total exports. In the light of those figures, what justification is there for increasing the already high protection given to that section of the community which produces only 3½ per cent. of the country's wealth, especially when by so doing we place the 56½ per cent., represented by the agriculturists and pastoralists, in a most iamentable position ? </para>
                    <para>One could continue to expose the inequities of the present system, but I shall leave that subject for the present. The Tariff Board's reports show clearly that many manufacturers have been greedy of profits, and have sought excessive rates of duty. I do not suggest that Australia is without manufacturers who are both good and capable; but I am concerned that our fiscal policy is altogether out of balance, and it ought to be righted more rapidly than it is. While the smaller primary producer makes greater demands and indulges in a certain amount of log-rolling, the wool-growing industry remains unprotected. The Wool Committee's report has scarcely been mentioned of late. The wheat-growing industry is in a similar plight. Many of our primary producers are only able to eke out a bare living, and others can scarcely do that. Those who are carrying on are able to do so only by reason of the assistance afforded by country storekeepers, State moratoriums, debt adjustment acts, farmers' relief acts, and by using up what little capital they have acquired. I shall not, however, make the story too long or too sad, although, every week, properties are becoming more and more encumbered, and the smaller men particularly are experiencing greater difficulty in borrowing money to enable them to keep going. Improvements are being neglected, or are deteriorating, rabbits are increasing, and land to a great extent is unsaleable. The result of all these, things is that little or no opportunities exist in rural districts for giving work to others. At this stage I pause for a moment to refer to the idea which is becoming more and more accepted - and which I suggest is encouraged by this schedule - that the way to overcome our difficulties is by increasing the number of employees in urban industries, notwithstanding that those industries have to receive State protection in order to exist at all. That is not the thing to do. Were it not that the man on the land has been placed in an almost impossible position, through no fault of his own, he would be able to provide more work than is now possible. Unfortunately, the policy of the country seems to be that the primary producer shall bear the burden, and accept the risk of prices rising in time to avert disaster. </para>

Speaking generally, those were the points which I emphasized when I spoke in various parts of the country prior to the last election. Among those seven pointswere the following: - </para>

                    <para>Are we to assume that only the secondary industries are productive enterprises? That is not how I have interpreted the term. The last point of the policy announced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> was - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I read those four points, and then I look at this schedule, and, try as I may, I cannot regard the latter as an adequate carrying out of the former. </para>
                    <para>I welcome the decision of the Government to afford the Senate an opportunity to discuss the protective incidence of exchange and primage before this bill is finally disposed of. We should be better equipped to discuss that subject were we in possession of the Tariff Board's report on it. Personally, I should prefer to have the board's report before us now. Should the schedule pass through the Senate practically unaltered, there will probably be a claim that the schedule is approved, and that therefore there is no need to make effective any reduction of exchange which the Tariff Board might have suggested; and, alternatively, in the event of the Senate deciding that some duties should be reduced, it might be suggested that that result should render unnecessary some concession in the matter of exchange. I hope that the Government will consider the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> last night. Since I have not yet had time to consider carefully either the abbreviated account of the contents of the report, or the Government's proposals, I content myself with saying that at this stage my concern is largely that we shall not be held guilty of acting shabbily in regard to British preference. If the Government decided that any revision of the exchange should apply only toitems under the British preferential part of the tariff, a tremendous amount of juggling with foreign exchanges would be saved, and, in addition, Great Britain would be given a slight preference over all other countries, except, perhaps, those with which Australia had entered into trade agreements. </para>
                    <para>Some one has asked whether exchange is really a part of the tariff at all. It is, at least, a sideline of the tariff. In the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 9th June, it is reported that the New Zealand Government, in appointing a commission to investigate the customs tariff of that dominion, included as one of the items of reference, " The relations of the tariff to rates of exchange ruling in New Zealand and other countries". No one will deny that these subjects are interlocked. </para>
                    <para class="block">Where are we travelling in industrial matters? In my opinion, an industrial community is not the best community to have in any country. Whatever the misery that might have existed in England before the great industrial revolution there, and although the revolution brought wealth to the country and alleviated some of its distress, I suggest that a really happy and prosperous country is one in which the people live, not in masses in the cities, working in factories, but in more healthy surroundings in rural districts. Australia is not a country in which the population must necessarily be congested and thrown together. Because of its immense area, Australia's natural development should be in the country districts rather than in the towns and cities. </para>
                    <para>I suggest that these high tariff schedules, which are placing a great burden upon the primary producers, are steadily driving men out of the country into the cities. From an examination of statistics dealing with South Australia for the last ten years, I find that in only about three country towns of that State has the population increased during that period, two of them being what might be termed fashionable resorts. People are being attracted to the city because of the amenities offering in urban centres, greater advantages for education - those, fortunately, are now also being carried into the country - and, because of the unfair distribution of the gains which may be made. I was reading recently an address on SirWalter Scott by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mungo</inline> MacCallum. Scott, as honorable senators opposite will recollect, was a tory and there are some who will say that a tory must necessarily be wrong in his opinions. However, Scott was not always wrong, and I give this view for what it is worth. The extract reads - </para>

He eyed industrial progress askance, as in his view it meant the triumph of machinery and competition over friendly use and wont and comradelike give and take. The only feature of contemporary Scotland with which he had hardly any sympathy or acquaintance, was the growth of her manufacturing and trading centres.  . . The following sentence from one of  his private letters might have been written by the author of the <inline font-style="italic">Fors Clavigera</inline> - "Manufactures are transferred to the great towns, where a man may assemble five hundred workmen one week and dismiss them the next, without having any further connexion with them than to receive a week's work for a week's wages, nar any further solicitude about their future than if they were so many old shuttles." <inline font-style="italic">{Extension of time, granted".]</inline> Is that the sort of Australia that we wish to evolve, or that it is desirable to evolve; a country in which tremendous areas of land are available, although we force our people into congested city areas, to work in offices and factories? Is not Australia a land of open spaces and immense distances; a land where any man of our people can go out and take the advantages IIi at it offers, and where something of those qualities which are to be found in the seaman or the man who has lived all his days in the country, may be his, too? </para>

                        <para>The tariff policy which has been followed by many countries in the past has been greatly aggravated in recent years. This tendency has contributed largely to the disorganization of world conditions. In respect of tariff policy and treaty policy, as in the case of import restrictions, the conference must seek to modify existing practices and to secure the adoption of more liberal methods. </para>

                    <para>No more important statement of the case for a reduction of tariffs could have been produced than this document, nor could the' opinions of this responsible body of men have been couched in more arresting language. My mind goes back to the 1927 conference, which was held in Geneva, to deal with a similar condition of affairs. Nearly all the leading countries were represented, and all were agreed on the general principle that tariffs were altogether too high; thai drastic reductions must be made; that there should be uniformity in customs classification; that prohibitions should be abolished, licences, quotas, and such like set aside, and that these matters should be controlled by way of tariff. </para>
                    <para>Then I come to the Tenth Assembly of the League of Nations, at which the two predominant notes were Pan-Europe and tariff peace. It will be remembered that " the Right Honorable William Graham, who was at the time  President  of the British Board of Trade, gave a practical turn to the debate when he propounded a plan for the reduction of customs duties by the conclusion of a tariff peace convention. The suggestion caught the attention of all who were at the conference, and it was decided to hold such a convention. That was done, the gathering beginning on the 17th February, 1930, and concluding on the 24th March of the same year. It was attended by the leading statesmen and the great economists of the world. It was felt by all that, by continually erecting high tariff walls, the nations of the world were creating an economic cataclysm; that economic nationalism had practically gone mad. As a result of that convention, a commercial treaty was signed on the 24th March, 1930, by the representatives of the principal nations of the world. Unfortunately, matters altered in 1929, and began to get worse in 1930, so that circumstances worked against the proposal, and practically nothing has been achieved by the convention. I am afraid that a similar condition of affairs may again come about.I do not think that the majority of the nations will reduce their tariff walls unless they are forced by desperation to do so, but I think that economic factors are appearing that will, in the near future, compel them to do that which is so urgently needed for the benefit of the world. Then will the nationsbe released from economic bondage. </para>
                    <para>I come again to the economic conference that is being held in London, and I shall read from the introduction to the draft annotated agenda, which puts the position as these men of international fame see it. </para>

                        <para>Before setting forth the problems which require solution, we wish to call attention to the gravity of the situation with which the world is confronted. Unemployment has recently been estimated by the International Labour Office as involving at least 30,000,000 workers. Even this huge total, which does not include the workers' families or other dependants, is probably an underestimate. The burden of suffering and demoralization resulting from unemployment of such proportions is appalling. Wholesale commodity prices - expressed in gold - have declined since October, 1929, by roughly a third; raw material prices on the average by 50 to60 per cent. In the middle of December, at Winnipeg,the price of wheat fell to the lowest level recorded in any primary market for wheat during the past four centuries. Such price-declines have produced profound disturbances in the economic system. They have thrown completely out of adjustment prevailing costs of the various factors of production, have made business enterprise generally unremunerative, and have seriously disorganized practically all the world markets. World stocks of agricultural products and of other raw materials continue to accumulate. The index of world stocks for 1932 was double that for 1925. Huge accumulations thus overhang some of the principal markets and burden the processes of orderly price re-adjustment. Industrial production has been drastically curtailed, particularly in those trades producing capital equipment. The depths which have been reached in some instances are illustrated by the position of the United States steel industry, which, at the close of 1932, was operating at only 10 per cent. of capacity. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is obvious that those gentlemen have come to the conclusion that matters are in a desperate position. Half of the agenda deals with tariffs, tariff walls, tariff restrictions, and prohibitions. That makes one pause for a moment, and think. The ideology of the high protectionist can be classified into two main series, which have been taken up by the masses, and have become an effective means of propaganda in favour of protection. The first is, security; and the second, naturally, social considerations. On the question of security, it is averred that, without sufficient tariff protection, it is not possible to maintain the manufactures that are necessary to the welfare of any community, and that we should be subject to the vagaries of an outside market. I do not think I need argue that point, other than to say that a man who does not grow fruit may still purchase it from a fruiterer. </para>
                    <para>On the question of social considerations the argument is that, unless manufacturers are protected against the low-wage countries, they must go to the wall; that we must make customs duties so high that they balance, not only the wage rate, but also the whole costs of production. This argument cannot stand criticism, but the important thing is that it sounds comprehensible and is accepted by the masses. Let us assume that we have to compete with countries in which low wages are paid. What about the obverse side of the medal - the primary producer, who has to sell his commodities in competition in markets which are supplied by those lowwage rate countries? If the secondary producer has to be protected against those who labour in lower social conditions than exist in Australia, surely the primary producer also must be protected, because he has to sell his products to such people. </para>

                            <para>- I have read several extracts in relation to the proceedings of that conference, and not one deals with the point raised by the honorable senator. It surely is obvious that if we maintain high tariff walls, a balance must be preserved by giving to the primary producer a certain proportion of the money that we receive as a consequence of the maintenance of the status of our secondary industries. If we restrict trade, if we interfere with the flow of goods, surely we shall be in serious trouble before long. It is said that tariffs make for greater employment. Is not that a fallacy? Is it not perfectly obvious that inadequate markets make for unemployment? To me, an adequate market is one that absorbs a volume of the production necessary to enable every one to maintain a decent standard of living, and has little to do with the tariff. If we had a tariff wall as high as it is possible to build one, the manufacturer still would not be able to carry on unless he had an adequate market in which to sell his goods. Therefore, if world trade is restricted and kept within the confines of the different countries, Australia and the rest of the Empire will be placed in a difficult position. </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened attentively to the speeches of Senators Millen and Duncan-Hughes, and am at a loss to follow the line of argument they have adduced. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> also referred to the question of exchange, and said that no country in the world had yet attempted to deal with it. I cannot see that that furnishes a reason for our neglecting to take action; but I am content to let the matter rest until the report of the Tariff Board on the protective incidence of primage and exchange is made public. All that I and my party are concerned about is the welfare of Australia. We desire to create in this country an Australian sentiment, and, to do that, we must offer an inducement to the people to buy locally-produced goods. If it is not possible to convince them of the wisdom of purchasing goods, in the production of which employment is provided for their fellow Australians, it must be made impossible for them to buy what is imported from foreign countries. There should be sufficient warrant for a tariff that will prevent the purchase of cheaper goods by those who are disinclined to help their own country. We realize the difficulty of putting such a policy into operation ; because, while the present paltry living wage continues, some persons must naturally buy in the cheapest market, even though the goods they purchase are inferior to those produced in Australia. Another aspect of the tariff question is our trade balance abroad. We have committed ourselves to certain interest payments. We have assured those of other countries who have sent their goods to Australia that we shall pay our way. We have also pledged our word to the payment of every shilling of interest that we owe. We cannot pay in gold, consequently we must find other means, and the only means which offers is the export of our surplus primary production. I realize that not many of our secondary products are exported. But I also know that this is a very young country, which has made wonderful strides in its production. As a matter of fact, with the exception of three or four commodities, we produce all that we require. One of the exceptions is petrol and oil products; and it was proved beyond the shadow of a doubt, while the Scullin Government was in office, that petrol can be produced at Newnes for8d. a gallon. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> smiles. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly, and the Government will fall down on its job if it does not obtain that information. The Scullin Government was defeated because it would not appoint a royal commission to do what could be done by a departmental inquiry. We have in the public departments men who are capable of performing this service. If the representatives of the Commonwealth on the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited are not capable of learning the facts, it is the duty of the Government- to recall them. The biggest part of our petrol and oil supplies comes from the United States of America, with which country our trading positionis so serious as to warrant any action by the Government to counteract it. Another commodity that we cannot produce in this country, so far as I know, is tea. </para>

                            <para>- As, with a couple of exceptions, we can produce all necessary commodities, we may live entirely without the assistance of the outside world. I consider that Australia is a child of the British Empire, and every child which fends for itself has the approval of its parents. But we are waiting, not only for the parent, but also for our enemies, to tell us what we should do, and to see what they are doing. Exchange  is  a factor which favours the present Government, but did not favour the Scullin Government from the outset of its career. When the Scullin Administration endeavoured to increase the flow of money in this country, by releasing credits, the party that now comprises the Government was opposed to it; but, immediately that party obtained control of the treasury bench, it agreed that the banks should increase the exchange rate, and that had the same result. When we proposed to take similar action, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson was called to the Bar of the Senate, and was asked if there were no other way out. That, at all events, was the excuse offered by the then Opposition, who knew in their hearts that they were doing wrong, and that they had no case. </para>

                            <para>- There was no panic. The Scullin Government did more than this Government has done to provide employment for the people. This country cannot turn the corner to prosperity until the problem of unemployment is at least partially solved. The tariff can be used to some extent to relieve unemployment, but it is merely a temporary palliative. Although we have hundreds of thousands of people unemployed, imports are still flowing into this country. If we are to provide employment we must manufacture our own requirements, and by increasing the wages bill, more money will be put into circulation, and additional employment will follow. The tariff must be so framed as to give an impetus to Australian manufacturers. Only in that. way can it be of benefit to Australia. </para>

All of our requirements, with the exception of one or two articles, could be manufactured by our own people. Unless the tariff is used to encourage our secondary industries, it merely provides employment for people in other parts of the world.We should not send a pound of greasy wool out of Australia. Our wool before it is exported should be scoured in order to save the freight on the grease. It is said that a suit of clothes contains 7 lb. of wool. The actual worth of so much wool at1s. a lb. is only 7s., whereas we pay £7 or £8 for the complete suit. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard some honorable senators say that wool is sold on the open market, and is subject to genuine competition, but I contend that there is no competition, because, usually, the wool is sold in split lots. I am against sending either greasy or scoured wool out of Australia. We should manufacture woollen clothing and export it overseas. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the question of the trade balance and the payment of our overseas obligations, particularly to Great Britain. For the eight years during which the Bruce-Page Government held office, our adverse trade balance averaged £14,000,000 annually. The Scullin Government had every justification for taking drastic action to rectify that enormous adverse trade balance.In order to rectify the trade balance, and, in addition, to meet our overseas commitments amounting to some £50,000,000 annually, that Government found it necessary to place a tariff barrier round Australia. Any country which requires our wool and wheat will buy those commodities, no matter how high our tariff wall may be. Sentiment does not enter into business, and that was clearly shown when Great Britain bought wheat from Russia merely because the price was lower than that of dominion wheat. We have in Australia a great opportunity to expand our home market. We have 100,000 men and women unemployed and not in a position to purchase Australian manufactures. They cannot even afford to buy boots. In prosperous times, Australia was able to manufacture in six months its requirements of boots for twelve months. And what would happen to the local boot manufacturers if imported boots were allowed to enter this country free of duty? </para>

                            <para>- It took this Government a long time to make up its mind whether it would continue the embargo placed, by the Scullin Government on the export of our stud sheep to Russia. As a loyal Australian, I am prepared to do everything within my power to make this nation prosperous. Our duty is to put the interests of our own manufacturers before those of foreign manufacturers. If we are to maintain a favorable trade balance, and meet our commitments abroad, we must send out of this country at least £15,000,000 worth of goods over and above the value of our imports. The only way in which we can meet our overseas obligations is by the export of gold or goods. The Scullin Government changed an adverse trade balance of £14,000,000 annually into a favorable trade balance of £11,000,000. That was a tremendous achievement of which the Labour party is justly proud. But if we fill the warehouses of this country with imported goods, we shall, within a few years, find ourselves in the position which faced the Scullin Government when it took office. We shall have an enormous adverse trade balance, and practically no money in the Treasury with which to meet our commitments. We shall then be forced to use that money for the purpose of paying interest to those who have accumulated the credit, and the burden will be heavier than before. I have here some figures prepared by the Commonwealth Statistician showing how our trade has gone against us over a number of years. </para>

                            <para>- There has been an increase in unemployment, I do not deny, but I am not for a moment endeavouring to trace a connexion between bur overseas trade balance and our domestic unemployment situation. The honorable senator knows very well, if he would admit it, that the tariff is not responsible for unemployment, or for driving the people from the country to the city. The fact is that there is little employment offering in the country for our people. Some mention was made of rabbittrapping, and perhaps if the Government would pay a bounty of 2d. or 3d. a pair on rabbits, more trapping would be done.

                    <para class="block">It will be seen, therefore, that our adverse trade balance has averaged £14,000,000 a year over this period, equal to a deficiency of ll£ per cent, on our imports. That was the position which confronted the Scullin Government when it assumed office, and that was one of the reasons why the tariff was raised. Even at that time the warehouses throughout Australia were full of imported products. Employment might have reacted more quickly to the measures taken by the Scullin Government had it not been for the stocks of accumulated goods. The manufacturers in Australia could not get going properly because, while those accumulated stocks remained to clog the market, there was not sufficient demand for the locally-made article. . Had it not been for this, the Government's hope that employment would be immediately found for 100,000 people might have been realized.

                            <para>- That is so. If we now reverse the Scullin Government's tariff policy, our overseas indebtedness will continue to pile up. We shall have to fund our overseas indebtedness, and the interest on that money will be added to the interest bill we already owe. How, then, can we ever hope to get" out of our difficulties? I believe that Great Britain would appreciate any move we could, make with a view to coming to some satisfactory arrangement for meeting our obligations. We have no desire to repudiate our debts; but if Great Britain, or any other country, is going to make a dumping ground of Australia for its surplus products, we shall have to repudiate. We shall be forced into such a position that it will be impossible .for us to pay. That is one reason why we should preserve the essentials of the Scullin tariff; the other, of course, being that it is necessary to provide employment for our own people. </para>

                            <para>- I appreciate the difficulty of finding markets, but the honorable senator evidently loses sight of the important fact that most countries in the world to-day are looking for markets abroad just as we are. They are all seeking some place in which to dump their surplus products. Because - of the improvement of machinery, and of production methods due to amalgamations, &amp;c, goods are being produced in larger quantities, and at cheaper prices, than ever before, and all the producing countries are desperately seeking a market for their output. We realize, of course, the stupidity of trying to sell wheat to Argentina, or rice to China, although we already have a surplus of rice in this country after only a year or two's production. Even Great Britain has at last decided to erect a tariff wall, a fact that is causing a good deal of anxiety to other countries. She has determined that she no longer will be a dumping ground for goods from other countries. I was reading in the press the other day that, since Britain had taken measures to protect her local primary producers, the price of pork had increased by 50 per cent. Britain is learning that she can produce a great deal more from the land than was thought possible. </para>

                    <para>That brings me to the subject of placing people on the land in Australia. From the speeches of some honorable senators, it would appear that, in order to solve the unemployment problem in the cities, it was only necessary to tell those  who are out of work to pack up their kit and get on the land. I remind honorable senators that, even the country towns of <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South Wales, and probably of the other States too, are, to a large extent, land-locked. The big land-owners control the land right up to the doors of the towns, and, even if the small man is willing to go on the land, he can do so only by paying so high a rent to those who own it that it would not be worth his while. If honorable senators really wish to know what the position is in regard to land, let them note the number of applications received whenever blocks of land are thrown open for selection. They will then realize how many thousands are anxious to get land, and how little land is available. The Labour party realized years ago that it was necessary to break up the large estates. With that end in view, it imposed the land tax, which resulted in the breaking up of large holdings, and the placing on the land of many persons who previously had no hope of ever getting there. If the Government wishes to get people on the land it should make land available on which they can settle. If it will not do anything to improve the lot of the man on the land, there are many "ways in which relief can be given. It should tax land-holders who are not producing. There is no need to find a market for the commodities now produced. There is already a market here, but the Government should make it possible for the Australian people to purchase the goods they require. The only way out of the difficulty is to provide them with profitable employment. The protection of our secondary industries is a means by which employment can be provided. </para>
                    <para>I support the second reading of the bill, because I realize that the duties which it imposes do not differ very materially from those imposed by the Scullin Government. If I had my way I would prohibit the importation of all goods that can be manufactured in this country, and in doing so I would be rendering a great service to Australia generally, and to the working class in particular. </para>

When discussing tariff matters we should not restrict ourselves to particular customs duties such as are embodied in this bill, but should also consider the manipulation and regulation of exchange, quotas, embargoes, bounties and subsidies, all of which could, I think, be covered by this bill. I shall endeavour to confine my remarks to one or two of these subjects. According to a statement on page7 of the agenda to which I have referred, the main questions for the conference as set out in the.

Many countries have raised tariff and other barriers in order to give them something with which to bargain at the World Economic Conference. Germany, for instance, has declared a moratorium on all debts due before 1931. France has imposed many quotas, especially against British goods, in order to provide her with some bargaining powers at the conference. The United States of America seems to have deliberately devalued the dollar for the same purpose, and Japan has also devalued the yen to such an enormous extent that at present it is worth something in the vicinity of ls. 3d., instead of its normal value of approximately 2s. sterling. </para>

                            <para>- The devaluing of the yen has been the means of attracting a tremendous amount of foreign trade to Japan. During the last few weeks I have passed through several foreign countries and some towns in which there is practically free trade. In Port Said, Aden and Colombo, I found that practically all the goods sold were of Japanese manufacture, and that the prices were so ridiculously low that trade with other countries had practically ceased. This is likely to continue so long as Japan or any other country obtains trade by the artificial means of manipulating its currency. I also had the privilege of attending an important international conference held in Rome early in April of this year, at which many of the subjects mentioned in the agenda were discussed. The decisions reached at that conference, which consisted of delegates from 28 countries, were sent on for further discussion at the British Economic Conference now being held in London. At the conference in Rome it was found that customs barriers, and, in fact, all barriers to international trade, constituted a difficult problem. It was rather peculiar to hear the views expressed 'by some of the delegates as to what they considered the right way in which to obtain some benefit or improvement in world conditions. They all had the same idea of getting as much as they could, and of giving away as little as possible. I am very much afraid that we shall find a similar policy adopted at the World Economic Conference now being hold in London. It will be practically impossible to reach an agreement on many vital questions, owing to the fact that all countries, with, perhaps, the exception of Great Britain, who is prepared to place all her cards on the table, will adopt the attitude that they are entitled to get as much as they can. I fail to see how it will be possible to reach an agreement on many of the subjects to be dealt with at that conference. In quoting further from this document, I shall confine myself to the manipulation or  stabilization  of the exchange, as the other points which I intended to mention with regard to tariff barriers have already been ably dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> On page 21 of the report, it is stated that- </para>

                        <para>During the last few years, the situation has been aggravated by the existence, side by side with the system of trade restrictions, of various measures of foreign exchange control. These 'measures fall essentially within the monetary and financial sphere. But in practically all cases they constitute one of the most serious impediments to the exchange of goods, by restricting international payments. Exchange restrictions have also led to the adoption of a large number of clearing, compensation, and barter agreements, and the like. The object of such agreements originally was to enable trade to continue in spite of the restrictions in force; but they have since been given a wider application. Sometimes they operate so as to divert trade into artificial channels, to give artificial advantages to producers in the countries employing them, and to involve discrimination in the discharge of accumulated and current debts, as between creditors of different nationalities. These clearings and compensation agreements have a particularly disruptive influence owing to their tendency to give a purely bilateral character to international commercial and financial relations, and they should be promptly abandoned if normal conditions are to be restored. </para>

                    <para class="block">The advice seems to be that if 'at all possible there should be a more extensive flow of international trade, which during recent years has been severely restricted. In this connexion, we have noticed that every country is endeavouring, as far as possible, to keep trade within its own boundaries. Even the small European countries, which a few years ago had to import practically the whole of their foodstuffs, are now nearly self supporting. I allude, for instance, to Italy, a country which I had the privilege of visiting a short time ago. Until recently, Italy had to import practically all the wheat required to feed the Italian people, but at present every little block of land throughout Italy is being cultivated to the utmost extent, and that country, in the matter of foodstuffs, is now almost self contained. </para>

                            <para>- Rice is being grown in Lombardy and in Picardy. It is being produced on small blocks by means of intense cultivation, as in Eastern countries. It will therefore be seen that, to a certain extent, Italy is becoming self supporting in regard to those commodities essential to the people. We have to consider the cost of production, and the capacity of the world to consume. After all, the fact remains that the prices of certain commodities have been so low that it has been impossible for the producers to purchase to the same extent they did a few years ago. If it is possible to raise price levels to the point at which they stood a few years ago, say in  1929,  we should do it, for that would increase the purchasing power of the people, and enable them to buy larger quantities of goods. This would, undoubtedly, help the people on the land, as well as those in the cities. </para>

I should like to see some of the duties reduced, especially those applicable to articles needed by the primary producers. As our primary producers must sell their products on the markets of the world at world prices, we should make the goods they must buy available to them at the lowest possible price.

                        <para>. -  I wish to discuss certain statements made by the Minister in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan),</inline> which seem, so far, to have escaped the attention of honorable senators. I have had passages with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> on various occasions, but I congratulate him upon the excellent second-reading speech which he delivered. As he said, the tariff is one of the most important subjects which we could discuss in existing circumstances, and we should do everything possible to deal with it in such a way as to relieve the existing economic strain. The Minister, and also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> stated that tariff barriers which caused too strong an emphasis to be placed on economic nationalism were one of the main causes of the difficulty which the world is now facing. I contended in the speech which I delivered on the motion for the first reading of this bill, that our greatest trouble originated long before France began the depreciated currency race. It began when the bondholders, whose activities are centred principally in New York and London, commenced a deliberate squeeze with the  object of bringing about a higher return or favorable re-adjustment in regard to the huge amount of interest payable on the thousands of millions of pounds invested in loans to other countries. The second main cause of our troubles - there are, of course, contributory causes - was the cessation of lending by the creditor countries. </para>

                            <para>- It was one of the main causes, because it increased the debts of many nations, and so increased the interest bill. The war undoubtedly caused a revolutionary change in the position of many nations, and converted some debtor nations into creditor nations. It has been said, with truth, that while it took Great Britain 100 years to accumulate a credit of £4,000,000,000 in her world trade, it took the United States of America perhaps fifteen years to convert her debt of £2,000,000,000 into a credit of £4,000,000,000. In other words, in the short period of fifteen years or so, the United States of America was changed from a heavy debtor nation into a strong creditor nation. There are, of course, other creditor nations, like France; but iri consequence of the wai", the financial authorities of the United States of America took the box seat, and became a leader in a race for financial supremacy. At present the United States of America is actually in the position of a world dictator on finance. Undoubtedly New York and London control the position. This view is supported by men of such standing as Professor Walter Murdoch, who, in a recent address to the members of the Perth Rotary Club on " The Art of Swindling ", declared that the basic swindle of our time and the cause of the present distress was the banking system, which could create and destroy money at the will of a, small group of men who had become the irresponsible lords of the world. </para>

Professor Murdoch is not an economist, but a literary authority of undisputed ability. In the course of his address, he quoted from a leading article of the London <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> to the effect that the economic experts had expressed so many conflicting opinions and had given such contradictory advice that it seemed to bc time to turn to men not professing to be experts and consequently unhampered by preconceived theories. </para>

The mere fact that a man has won the degree of bachelor of the science of economics or has proceeded even to the degree of doctor of that science, is not a sufficient reason for accepting his statements  holus  bolus. We all know that many of the economists of the 19th century who, in their day, were regarded as outstanding leaders, lived long  enough  to see their pet theories discredited. Some of them swallowed their most dogmatic utterances. John Stuart Mill, as we all know, became practically a socialist. There is no reason, therefore, why we should accept without question even the words of the economists who prepared the annotated agenda for the World Economic Conference from which the Minister in charge of this bill quoted at' considerable length. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Experience is the best teacher. I do not want to deal with extraneous subjects, but I must say that I have been amused to read some of the comments on the happenings at the recent test matches between England and Australia, by persons who did not see the matches. Those who played the game and saw it played know very well what happened; and they also know the effect of body-line bowling. So I suggest that those who pass through the mill of practical experience in our financial and economic world know exactly what is happening. At present, a veil hides from the general public the happenings in the banking parlours of the world. With all due respect to those who prepared the annotated agenda for the World Economic Conference, I say that we shall not solve the [problems which confront us unless we bring practical experience to the consideration of them. That is the point that Professor Murdoch made in the address which he delivered. I hope I shall not be charged with seeking to curry favour with the Government when I repeat that, in my opinion, the Minister in charge of this bill delivered an excellent address in moving the motion for the second reading of the measure; ho gave us much information and thoughtful comment on the various solutions offered for the removal of the present world disaster. No one, of course, will agree with all that he said, for no two senators will think exactly alike on those subjects. I shall quote, briefly, extracts from the Minister's speech on which I wish to enlarge. The honorable gentleman, in dealing with debtor and creditor nations, said - </para>

When that policy was put into operation, the people of the United States of America necessarily suffered, too, and the effect of the policy was felt throughout the world. When creditor nations ceased to lend, development was arrested, and world industry was almost brought to a standstill. A few years before the world crisis came to a head - about the end of 1928, or the beginning of 1929 - about £150,000,000 was being lent annually to other nations by the United States of America, and when that stream of capital ceased to flow, the effect on development was tremendous. A whisper went through the banking" parlours that development was not to be undertaken ; in other words, that deflation was to take place. Proof of this is found in the fact that Australia was unable to borrow from Great Britain, although plenty of money was available there. The private banks in England are bursting with it, and they have earned large dividends in recent years, even as high as 18 per cent. That, I maintain, is one of the reasons why the nations have been forced by deflation into the fierce battle of raising tariffs, one against the other. While the Minister's statement admits the lending policies of the great creditor nations as one of the considerations to be discussed, it proceeds as follows : - </para>

                            <para>-  But those who have read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davidson's</inline> circular know that the suggestion did not originate with him. I think that he said that an extensive public works policy would provide a means of getting money iinto circulation. During the debate in this chamber last year, I suggested that we should control our internal loans and our internal currency to the extent of launching a big programme of public works, and I mentioned such proposals as the unification of railway gauges, which was estimated to cost £57,000,000, the construction of a railway from Queensland to the Northern Territory - this has since been supported by a private syndicate, who asked the Federal Government to give them the right to build such a line - and also harbour improvements. I do not suggest for a moment that I have exhausted the list of works that could be profitably undertaken. Various suggestions have been made to me since, such as land-settlement propositions, which are excellent in their way. I was much amused, on reading the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times,</inline> when an honorable member in another place spoke on the subject of the need for uniformity of railway gauges in Australia, which I had suggested as a necessary public work which would provide a means of useful employment, that this was regarded by that journal as a new constructive suggestion. The writer was, apparently, unaware that I had mentioned that matter and other constructive proposals for our present troubles in this chamber. We should take a hand in the matter of assisting internal recovery, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. David</inline> son remarked, by government investment. That gentleman may not be in agreement with the Labour party as to the best means of giving effect to that policy ; but, if the Government of the day would adopt an extensive public works policy, it would ease the position in Australia to a large extent, and indicate to the World Economic Conference that Australia, at any rate, considers that the policy of deflation, which has been practised for the last three or four years, should come to an end.

They have lost their homes, and any savings that they may have accumulated. Personally, I have had the bitter experience of suffering loss on account of the present depression. Undoubtedly, the workers have had more than their share of the misfortunes consequent upon it. I believe that the problem is capable of solution ; but those who control the financial situation will not be satisfied until the workers' standard of living is so depressed that the workers are carrying the whole burden of the £40,000,000 of war costs. </para>

But, in recent years, there has been- a remarkable change in the situation, duc to the adoption of the policy of deflation.

It is true that there was a slight recession in 1921-22; but, generally speaking, the world appeared to be in a prosperous condition until about 1928, when those controlling the "money power, to bring about a certain result, conceived the grand scheme of depressing prices and checking the flow of credit. It is thus apparent that the war was not the immediate cause of the widespread depression. </para>

That happens to be my position at the present time. But the nations did not take that course. Instead, they continued their wild career of lavish expenditure, believing, doubtless, that the good times would last indefinitely, and it is true to say that, for a number of years after the war, certain sections of the people in every country had a very good time. Now all nations have to face the realities of the situation, and make up their minds what they were going to do about it. </para>

Were it otherwise, I should be inclined ' to berate the Government more fiercely than I have hitherto attempted to do in this chamber. We are all, more or less, agents for particular forces, and, when things go wrong, governments, like individuals, have not that full power to right them which many people suppose that they have. Despite the heavy debts incurred by all countries during the war, financial difficulties did not appear to be imminent until 1928, when those in control of the money power began to restrict credit, throughout the world. What happened in Australia was part of the general scheme. It has been suggested tha_t this country, which appeared to be the most prosperous of the nations about that time, was the first to' feel the shock of this changed monetary policy, when those who were responsible for it thought, probably, that their interests would 'best be served by a. deflationary movement, which would have the effect of depressing commodities prices and wage standards.

                        on the field of battle, so in times of peace,- when grave difficulties confront a country, many causes, other than strategic skill, may be responsible for victory or defeat. It seems clear, on all the evidence) that the relaxing of the grip of world money power on world industry, arid' the continuing of credit by the only nations that can give it, would at least be a very substantial step towards bringing the world back to the position it occupied a few years ago.

I am hopeful that the pressure of the bondholders and the money power' against 'governments will soon be relieved./' If it is not, complete disaster is ahead for all countries. Australia cannot for much longer continue with its present army of approximately 400,000 unemployed persons. Every father of a son who is out of work knows how serious is this menace. The young people of this country are being ruined through the lack of employment in the most formative period of their lives. I heard recently that one  nursing institution  had received hundreds of applications from young women for the few positions that were vacant. The same thing is happening in practically every industry in this country. On every hand the surplus of labour is enormous, and since the vast majority of the unemployed are young people, they are not having a fair chance at the starting point of their lives. The Minister, referring to the work ahead of the World Economic Conference, quoted the following from the annotated agenda : - </para>

                    <para>Economic armaments in all countries have been rapidly increasing, because of the stoppage of credit and export of capital, with the resultant damping down of prices. Even in this partly developed country we had to prohibit the importation of many commodities to prevent complete disaster. The Scullin Government, which imposed embargoes and raised the tariff on many items, had this objective in mind. Had there been in power a freetrade government like the Bruce-Page Administration, it would not have given effect to a legislative programme necessary to save Australia. At that critical period of our history the need was, not for protection in the case of any particular tariff item, but for the actual prohibition of importations of many commodities in order to prevent the country from becoming bankrupt. </para>

If the world is to recover, they must undoubtedly release their grip, and modify their lending and commercial policies. They should give the " Word " - investing it with the full scriptural significance - to their agents throughout the world to ease the onerous conditions that lie so heavily on debtor nations. No one will deny that this monetary dominion is exercised mainly by financial interests in New York and London. Homer Lee, in his well-known book, <inline font-style="italic">The Day of Hie Saxon,</inline> published some years before the war, pointed out that, because of his ruling world position, the Anglo-Saxon of New York and London controlled  the destinies of the world. The Slav danger and the Teutonic menace are now in the background. The day of the Anglo-Saxon has arrived, and all the evidence goes to show that his exercise of the money power must be tempered with discretion, because, if used unwisely, it will bring ruin, not only to the world generally, but also to those who abuse their power. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have not seen the complete copy of the annotated agenda, so I depend for my information upon the long quotations made from it by the Minister in his speech the other night. I am glad to note that it emphasizes the responsibility resting on the great" creditor nations, which, for some years, have been in the world's financial saddle. To bring about an improvement, we must first have a definite alteration of world financial policy. Those in control of it are comparatively few. Probably half a dozen persons, at the most, use this enormous power of deflation throughout the world with its attendant miseries for so many millions of people. Every year, the .advance of science brings the world closer together. It now takes no longer to travel from London to Australia or from Australia to New York than it took to go from Edinburgh to London one hundred years ago. Economically, as well as geographically, the world is being brought together, though racially and linguistically its countries may still be far apart. It is some satisfaction to me to see in this annotated agenda some of the things which I have emphasized in former speeches. Any one who takes the trouble to study the facts and the indiscreet remarks of various important persons from time to time, must realize that the present position of the world has been brought about by a vast organization of capital on the other side of the world. The total population of Australia is not greater than that of some of the English counties. Despite its size, Australia is not so important to the world as is the State of New York in the United States  of  America - a State that, alone, has over  10,000,000  people. </para>
                    <para>The remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> regarding the British Empire were interesting. Australia is a part of that Empire; but what would have been its position had the Great War destroyed the Empire? This country must seek protection outside its borders; and if that protection 'were not forthcoming from the source to which we have looked for it in the past, we should probably have sought it from the United States of America. Australia owes a great debt to the Empire to which it belongs, and, because of that, the people of this country are inclined to swallow without question the policy of Britain. Australia is a grown-up nation, and it should say definitely to the Motherland and to the United States of America that their domination has continued long enough. Although a strong protectionist, I should like to see international freetrade throughout the world, so long as it was properly controlled. The adoption of such a policy would solve the world's troubles, and avert a war every hundred years or so. In dealing with the tariff schedule, I shall do my best to protect Australian industries, with a view to making Australia as self-contained as possible; but I hope that the World  Economic  Conference now sitting in London will do something for the benefit of humanity in general, so that the workers and producers throughout the world will no longer be ground down by the money forces which now dominate all nations. </para>

                        <para>. - This tariff debate is not different from other tariff debates to which I have listened. Whenever a tariff schedule is before the Senate, those who believe in the highest form of protection describe as freetraders who are out to smash Australian industries those who advocate a moderate tariff. Unfortunately, that cry is repeated in a large section of the press of Australia. That accusation is generally directed against the members of the Country party, which is said to be "the most' one-eyed' section in the community,which wants everything possible for itself, but is unwilling to allow other sections of the community any privilege whatever." That that view is not held by all the people of Australia is evident from the fact that this Parliament contains a member of Country party members. In my opinion, there is no such person as a hundred-per-cent. protectionist. Every protectionist whom I have known believes in the highest possible protection for the particular industry in which he is engaged, and in absolute freetrade in the raw materials which he uses Australian manufacturers of cloth would not hesitate to buy their wool outside Australia, if they could get wool of equal quality at a lower price. Yet they howl to high Heaven, and to this Parliament, to protect them against their brethren in England from whom, as it were, they obtained their mother's milk. </para>

                                gave a novel and extraordinary reason for the inclusion in the Federal Constitution of the sliding scale by which Western Australia was to benefit for five years. The honorable senator said that that provision was inserted in the Constitution in order to enable Western Australia to establish its own industries, so that that State would not be at the mercy of the eastern States.

                                is, I think, the first man to offer that explanation.

                        <para>The agreement will benefitall sorts and conditions of people, and it will make stronger both the Commonwealth and the United Kingdom in a collective sense. That which makes Australia stronger in a general sense and adds in a general way to the strengthof Britain must commend itself to this House, and to the Australian people. But the Australian Delegation, with the full support of the Commonwealth Government, aimed for something nearer and more tangible than a general benefit either to Australia or to the United Kingdom., From the beginning of the preparation for Ottawa until the conference closed, we worked for benefits for our primary producers. </para>
                        <para>We worked in the belief that in the fashioning of tariff in this- country the man on the land, and his employees, have 'hitherto come off second best. They have been given, it is true, compensatory duties and arrangements in an endeavour to balance them up, and, with respect to the local Australian market, that policy has been attended by some success. </para>

                        <para>But with respect to the great export surplus of primary production the man on the land and those who work for him have been, to state it mildly, somewhat overlooked by this Parliament. It is scarcely an exaggeration^ to say that, hitherto, this Parliament has been in tariff and industrial legislation a twostandard Parliament - a standard for the cities and another standard, very much inferior, for the country. </para>
                        <para>This Ottawa agreement, which I now submit to the House, makes an attempt, belated it is true, but a sincere, constructive and comprehensive attempt to adjust that unfair balance. It proclaims in the first place the inherent right of the country people of Australia and their industries to equal economic consideration with the city people and secondary industries in this Parliament. Next it recognizes the desperate plight of all who are engaged in primary industry at the present time, and their imperative claims to assistance and relief. It is an acknowledgment, too. of the plain, unchallengeable truth, that had it not been for the magnificent fortitude and industry of our farmers and pastoralists, and their unprecedented production and export during these years of adversity, there must have been a total collapse of our whole financial and industrial structure, with a calamitous further increase of unemployment and money available neither for its relief nor for the maintenance of our great social services. </para>
                        <para>We owe our financial, industrial and economic salvation during this crisis to the man on the land. This agreement has been drawn in aid of the man on the land, but it has the supreme merit that, if we aid the man on the land, we aid every agency of industry and business, and employment in the Commonwealth. This charter of rural aid could be a thousand times justified if it carried in it the curbing of other Australian interests to the advantage of primary industry. </para>

                            <para>- I remember that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> was Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs he was one of the warmest admirers and supporters of the Tariff Board. I do not know what has occurred to cause that body to fall from grace in his estimation. I assure honorable senators, if such an assurance is now necessary, that the Country party does not believe in- absolute freetrade. Belief in a revenue tariff is one of the planks in the platform of the Western Australian association to which I belong. A tremendous amount of duty may be collected under a revenue tariff, and some of the duties imposed for the purpose should be high enough to please anybody. What we object to is an excessive tariff which places a burden upon the rest of the community. Some honorable senators will claim that there are no excessive duties, and that no exploitation of the community is taking place. To enlighten them I shall read a report which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 1st June last, of a case which was heard in the Arbitration Court in Melbourne. It is as follows: - </para>

                <para class="block">I suggest that that word " partly " means 99 per cent. If that is not an excessive profit to be made by an industry that is enjoying great benefit as a result of our protective tariff, I should like a precise definition of the word " excessive ". </para>

Would any honorable senator advocate that protection should be lavished upon 'a number of abortive industries which have no chance of success, merely as a means of squandering public money ? Anybody who knows anything about farming and pastoral pursuits is aware that a farmer will not rear a defective animal that has no hope of developing into a useful beast, but will knock it on the head, and thus save futile expense. According to those who object to article 9, we should rear and spoonfeed defective industries which, because they are cripples, want more coddling than does a healthy organization. </para>

As a further instance of the way in which the primary industries have been dealt with, I shall quote from a report of the Tariff Board on butter and cheese, which was issued on the 28th of November, 1927 - </para>

Whore labour is employed it is undoubted that it is paid extremely low wages, and even under the above conditions, it was maintained on all sides that the dairy farm hardly paid its way and did not give anything like a fair and adequate return to the dairy farmer. </para>

                        <para>After hearing .the evidence, the Tariff Board has arrived  at  the conclusion  that the dairying  industry in Australia ' is being carried on under conditions involving long hours to the dairy farmer; that in very many cases the farmers are utilizing the services of the women and children of the family, and that when labour is employed it is receiving an extremely low remuneration, and  that  even under these conditions the farmer himself is not receiving an adequate return either in wages  to  himself or interest on his capital. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is useless for any one to say that customs duties have not been increased. It is too painfully evident to all that a small reduction of the duties on tools of trade and the machinery necessary for the production of wheat do not adequately offset the lowering of the price of that commodity by at least  75  per cent. Had the reduction of duties been commensurate with the decline in the return to the wheat-grower, a different story would have been told by Australian manufacturers. This country cannot be righted by inflicting an injustice upon one section, to the advantage of another. Any action must benefit the whole of the community. If the purchasing power of the people is lessened, costs must be reduced correspondingly. </para>

The exact opposite is the case. I have nothing to say in disparagement of the home market, which is good so far as it goes; but it falls far short of the requirements of the primary producers of this country. I would remind our friends that the primary producer has the choice of two markets; that he may export what bo cannot sell locally; but that the secondary manufacturer is limited to the local market, and would be in a bad way if it did not absorb the whole of his production, because, so far, he has shown himself utterly unable to compete on the markets of the world, as the wool and the wheat grower have to do. So I suggest that the Government should do its level best so to fix duties that those upon whom Australia really is dependent shall have a fair chance of working out, not only their own salvation, but also the salvation of the rest of Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - Having heard the tariff policy of the present Government expounded during the last eighteen months, and having paid particular attention to the proposals incorporated in the bill now before the Senate, one is forced to the conclusion that on this, as on every important matter, the Government is either incapable of making up its mind, or has no mind to make up. The speeches that have been delivered upon the bill probably furnish the reason for the lack of decision, and the hesitation displayed by the Government. The only vital  vote  so far taken, and the speeches of government supporters^ - whether they be real or nominal supporters remains to be proved by the success or the failure of the Government to pass this legislation  in  the form it desires - an indicative of a hopeless confusion of thought. In the old days, when 'great forensic battles on fiscal questions were waged in the Commonwealth Parliament, and in the parliaments of the States before federation was established, there was in variably a distinct division of opinion, one element believing in freetrade, and the other favouring protection. Usually, the freetraders advanced other proposals, which in their opinion were better suited to the development of this country; invariably, they were advocates of land value taxation. To-day, however, the charge which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> levelled against the protectionist section of this Parliament, and the advocates of protection in this country - that they are not  100  per cent, protectionists - is pertinent to the honorable senator himself, and to  many  of his colleagues. They are not  100  per cent, anything; they believe  in  freetrade, free land, and probably, at the bottom of their hearts, free labour. Their code, in its application to the conditions governing the development of industry, is only slightly different from the slave code. Is it to be wondered at that  a  Government which depends for its support upon persons with such confused ideas, drawn from a party which produces such  a  multiplicity of opinions that lead nowhere, should be unable to make up its mind on this or any other important subject? </para>

                    <para>During this debate, and on the motion for the first reading of the bill, the domestic quarrel between the two sections that support the Government has been intruded, and another chapter has been added to the famous controversy that has waxed more or less warm for the last fortnight. At the risk that always accompanies interference with domestic quarrels, I consider it wise that at this juncture some observations should be made from this section of the Senate. What took place during the negotiations between the United Australia party and the United Country party has been confused by the welter of assertions, denials, and counter-denials with which the Senate has been regaled for the last fortnight. The story of the quarrel, and of the attempt to patch up a truce between chose two sections, should be permanently embodied in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> But any one who reads the story, which becomes enlarged with each additional testimony, must be hopelessly bewildered as to what was the basis of the agreement. The other evening, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> the Government Whip, read at great length a number of extracts from newspapers, which purported to show what had been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy, Sir Henry</inline> Gullett, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham.</inline> The excuse that he offered was that he desired to have those statements permanently incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I presume that the honorable senator was present at the famous private deputation, which is now said not . to have been private, that took place before <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Gullett and the other Commonwealth delegates left Australia for Ottawa. As, I presume, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> was present at the meeting, it is strange that he did not enlighten the Senate and the public generally about what actually transpired there. It is also strange to observe the silence of other honorable senators on this subject. Why have they not given their version of what transpired, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Gullett's reference to the negotiations which took place prior to the election between the United Australia party and the United Country party? Those negotiations must have some bearing upon the tariff bill which we are now discussing. Honorable senators who belong to the United Australia party say that it was arranged that a certain tariff policy should be adopted, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> arid ex-Senator Colebatch say that the arrangement was totally different. The Government denies that it has committed a breach of faith. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> in his excellent contribution to the debate, defended the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham), Sir Henry</inline> Gullett and others, but now we find that the apologists for the Government are shifting their ground. First they said that there was no agreement at all, but when it was clearly shown that an agreement had been entered into, they said that it was not ratified by the parties concerned. When it was shown that the Country party did ratify the agreement, the apologists for the Government replied that it had not been proved that the United Australia party had accepted the agreement. </para>

I am concerned, not with the negotiations which took place between the two parties supporting the Government, but with what occurred prior to the last election. I am concerned with the position' of the great manufacturing industries of this country, and the deliberate breach of faith on the part of the Government in framing its present tariff policy. That, ,1 think, is relevant to the bill under discussion. What were the people of Australia led to believe would be the tariff policy of this Government? On that subject the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> published a pertinent article on the 3rd September, 1932, much about the time when an important schedule,which is incorporated in this bill, was tabled by the Government.

One of the worst features of the Government's tariff-making or tariff-breaking policy is the uncertainty of its future intentions. This comprehensive schedule was discussed for weeks in the House of Representatives, but before ' honorable senators have reached the discussion' on the items the Government has stated that, at the committee stage, the Senate will be asked to agree to many tariff- alterations. How long is this uncertainty to exist? How long are the workers in the secondary industries and the manufacturers to be kept in suspense as to whether they are likely to be ruined or not as a result of this Government's tariff policy? Surely the people of this country should know where they stand on tariff matters.

Prom that I formed the opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> had threatened to take certain steps if the Government did not climb down from the position that it had taken, and that the Leader of of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said, in effect, "Don't shoot, we will climb down ". In other words, the white flag of surrender was hoisted by the Government, and a promise was made to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> and his colleagues that, before the bill was finally passed, the report of the Tariff Board on primage and exchange would be made available to honorable senators so that they might, if they so desired, move further amendments to the tariff. The strange silence observed by honorable senators occupying the ministerial bench shows unmistakably that my conclusions are correct. Although the Government has had the report of the Tariff Board under . consideration for at least three months, it has not yet been able to come to any decision upon it. It is hinted, of course, that after the Government has considered the subject for another month or two it may develop a policy in regard to it. We may then have some more, drastic amendments of the tariff. With such uncertainty, how can it be expected that those engaged in secondary industries will develop their enterprises? Even companies that are prepared to extend the capacity of their plant, increase the number of their employees, and add to the output of Australian manufactured goods, are not likely to do anything of the kind while they are uncertain of the tariff position. </para>

                    </continue><para>Why should exchange be seriously considered in relation to the protective policy of the country? The people of Australia are overwhelmingly protectionist in outlook. They believe that Australian primary and secondary industries should be organized under a well-ordered tariff policy. Their development should proceed along parallel roads. To put it in another way, their development should go hand in hand, for there is undoubtedly an  affinity  between primary and secondary industries in a country like Australia. Surely we are justified in believing that protection is the permanent policy of this nation ! The exchange rate is a fluctuating quantity which should not influence tariff considerations. In the final analysis is it not a fact that just as the exchange places another rail on the top of our tariff wall, and so helps to prevent the undue importation of foreign goods into Australia, it also automatically increases the prices of primary products in Australia, and so helps to add to the cost of the raw material which the Australian manufacturers use? In my opinion, one condition about balances the other, and this makes it unnecessary for us to consider the exchange in its relation of protection. </para><para>A notable feature of this debate has been the absence of adverse criticism of the tariff policy of the Scullin Government. Prior to the last election, the Minister in charge of this bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan),</inline> the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> and other honorable gentlemen opposite thundered forth denunciations of the Scullin tariff policy. Extracts from their speeches were cabled overseas, and telegraphed to all parts of Australia. After such a furore then, it is remarkable that there should be such a strange silence now. The fact is, of course, that the Scullin tariff was sound, and that it did what it was designed to do. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- The The honorable senator's interjections all support my argument. The Scullin tariff policy corrected our adverse trade balance, but in the last eighteen months this Government has been engaged upon a tariffreduction . and industry-wrecking policy which has had the consequences indicated by the honorable senator's interjections. The Scullin tariff policy was intended to effect two main purposes. Duties were imposed in order to protect our secondary industries, so that they should become permanent, and prohibitions and surcharges were imposed to correct an adverse trade balance which, we hoped, would be only temporary. We wished to check the flood of imports which had proceeded almost without interruption while the previous Government was in charge of the affairs of the country. Illuminating figures were quoted bySenator Dooley this afternoon, showing the fluctuation of our exports and imports of merchandise. I wish to examine the position in respect to the balance of trade and the payments against the trade balance. If these two items are considered together, they provide a reliable barometer of national solvency. During the eight years that the Bruce-Page Government was in office, our adverse balance, all items included, was £62,380,000 - that is on the trading side of the ledger, after allowing for the export of gold, bullion, and specie; but in the same period the Commonwealth and State governments became liable to oversea interest payments which totalled £193,445,520. So Australia went to the bad during the eight years of the Bruce Page régime to the extent of £255,825,520. This was the calamitous position which faced the Scullin Government when it assumed office. Immediate steps were taken to correct the position, and in two years the adverse trade balance was converted into a favorable trade balance, all items included, of £65,100,000. Oversea interest payments in the same period totalled £56,000,000. This left a surplus in favour of Australia of £9,100,000. This result was achieved under most disadvantageous circumstances. During the eight years of the Bruce-Page regime the prices of our primary products were relatively high; during the two years of the </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para class="block">Scullin régime the prices of all our export commodities, except dried fruits and wine, touched the most disastrously low level ever recorded. In spite of this fact, the Scullin Government rectified the adverse trade balance, and placed Australia in a solvent position. This Government has lifted many of the prohibitions and surcharges imposed by the Scullin Government, and I have no quarrel with it for doing so. Had the Scullin Government remained in office, these imposts would have been lifted immediately they had served their purpose. But this Government has gone much further than that. It has reduced our protective duties to such an extent that our trade balance has been disturbed despite the increase in the price of our export commodities. This increase is, of course, in no way attributable to this Government, but is the result of world conditions, which have been discussed during this debate, and which I do not now propose to describe. Although the national income has increased materially, the tariff policy of this Government has seriously interfered with our favorable trade position. Some interesting figures recently released by our statistical department reveal that, for the ten months from the 1st July, 1931,to the 30th April, 1932, the balance of exports over imports, all items included, was £34,422,000, whereas for the ten months from the 1st July, 1932, to the 30th April, 1933, the favorable balance was £36,193,000. These figures seem to be favorable until we discover that the returns for this year include exports of gold from the gold reserve against our note issue, estimated, in sterling value, at £11,265,636. In other words, a raid has been made on the national savings. Of course, this export of gold cannot be repeated next year. There has, therefore, actually been a serious falling off in Australia's favorable trade balance with the outside world. </para><para class="italic">

Nature has been kind to Australia during the last three or four years, and prolific production has, to some extent, counteracted the effect of low prices. </para><para>I referred earlier to the danger to Australian industry from the dumping of goods in the Australian market by overseas manufacturers. Several countries are making attempts to increase their export trade by depreciating their currency, and granting subsidies On exports. Press reports published during the last month or two have made it clear that in Great Britain steps are being taken to counteract the menace. The Australian Government, however, has evinced no disposition to protect Australian industry. </para><para>I have been twitted with refraining from making any reference to the effect of the tariff on primary production. I have no desire to evade the issue, and I am convinced that the detrimental effects on the primary industries which are alleged against a protectionist policy are merely so much political propaganda. In the various States, primary industries have been assisted by the construction of non-paying railways, and non-paying water works. These undertakings are not furnishing sufficient revenue to pay the cost of their construction, and the balance has to be made up by taxation. The manufacturing and working sections of the community are thus paying their fair share towards the assistance and development of the primary industries, but the secondary industries have conferred a more direct benefit on those engaged in primary production by furnishing an increasing market for quantities of primary products. I can never understand the mentality of those alleged representatives of the primary producers who favour a policy which would compel the producers to pay freight on their products to convey them thousands of miles to markets in other countries when, by a properly co-ordinated system of development, we could provide a. market in this country for the greater part of what we produce. In order to show to what extent the establishment of secondary industries has already assisted the primary producers, let me compare conditions as they existed in 1907, when the first real attempt at protection was undertaken, with those which existed in 1930, the last year for which complete statistical data are available. In 1907, Australian primary products to the value of £57,646,000 were consumed in Australia, while in 1930, the value had increased to £138,748,000, an increase of £81,102,000. Prices for primary products were practically the same during both periods, so that it will be seenhow tremendous was the increase of consumption during that time. To whom were those primary products sold? For the most part, they were sold to those employed in Australian manufacturing industries, and no better market could possibly exist. Certainly it is an infinitely better market than that which we supplied under the old free-trade policy of importing our requirements From overseas, and trying to induce the people living in low-wage countries, from which we imported, to purchase our primary products. </para><para>During this period, the consumption of dairy and farmyard products, which are of a particular type, increased from £12,720,000 in 1907, to £40,855,000 in 1930. In addition to that, on £9,000,000 worth of butter exported from Australia in 1930, the Australian public paid, in the form of a bounty under the Paterson butter scheme, approximately £2,000,000 to the dairy farmers. These are facts, not the rhetoric used by the members of the Country party to tickle the ears of the voters at election time. The truth is now recognized by every intelligent primary producer in the country, and in these times all primary producers are intelligent men. The old days when the farmer was not educated, is past. We have now to deal with primary producers of a new type. They have been emancipated, largely as a result of the policy inaugurated by Labour governments, which has resulted in the creation of better conditions and better local markets. The old days of moleskins and </para><para class="block">German print have gone, as has the time when the farmer went in fear and trembling to the local bank or the local storekeeper, wiping his boots on the mat before entering the august presence. The majority of the farmers in these days realize which fiscal policy is better suited to their interests. </para><para>Reference was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> to the cost of agricultural implements. I am in possession of facts which prove that the tariff has not resulted in increas ing the cost of agricultural implements to the farmers. Why did not the honorable senator quote the price of such implements in freetrade countries, or in those overseas British possessions such as East Africa, where there is freetrade? </para><interjection>

                        It has been said that the products of our secondary industries comprise only 4 per cent. of the total value of our exports. That is not true. A great many commodities classified in the statistical returns as primary products should really come under the heading of manufactured goods. For instance, butter, metals, &amp;c., which have gone through expensive processes in Australia, are just as much secondary products asis the cloth from a woollen mill. I have here a list of about 200 items of this kind, all of which have been processed before export. Their total value is no less than £23,315,484, representing 26 per cent. of the value of our total exports for the year 1930-31. For that year the value of our exports in Australian currency was £89,056,000, of which approximately £65,000,000 represented real primary products. Included in this list is butter, valued at £8,120,165 ; cheese, £244,066; flour, £3,513,573; other cereal manufactures, £419,717 ; preserved fruits, £610,779 ; and lead manufactures, £2,424,808. It is obvious that each of those items has been subjected to an extensive and, in most cases, an expensive manufacturing process before leaving Australia. This shows that Australian industries can be built up under a protective tariff, because these products have to be sold in open competition in the world's markets. "We have the finest lead-smelting works in the world at Port Pirie, in South Australia. These works were established, and have been maintained, under our protective policy. The mines at Iron Knob and Hummocky Hill, in that State, export iron ore in competition with other countries. From £400,000 to £500,000 worth per annum is sent to various parts of the world, and last year substantial consignments were despatched to the United .States of America,- in the teeth of world competition. That disposes of the fallacious argument of the opponents of the protective tariff of this country that only primary products can be exported from Australia under such a policy.
                    </para><para>This, Government has already done sufficient harm by the amendments of the Scullin tariff which it has made. "Why allow the doubt which exists in the minds of manufacturers and their employees to-day to continue as the result of statements which come from authoritative sources, and are never corrected by the Government, to the effect that this is only the first instalment of its tariff policy? During the course of this debate, we have heard ample quotations from the agenda of the World Economic Conference, showing that honorable senators are at least aware of the fact that, during the next twelve months,, vast and far-reaching changes in the economic position of the world may be made. While the present possibilities remain, we should pursue a stable fiscal policy. Such a policy was implemented by the last Government, and it accomplished the object which that Government set out to achieve. I urge this Ministry to allow fiscal matters to stand until world conditions have become more stable. We could then overhaul our tariff, and see whether it is necessary to increase or reduce duties, so that Australian industries may be carried on efficiently, and so that there may be well-ordered development. We have had an appeal from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> that we should look to the wide horizon. The members of the party to which I belong claim that they are associated with the only party that, considers the tariff problem from a purely Australian point of view, unfettered by the clamorous demands of any particular section for recognition. We realize that the best interests of the workers, the primary producers, and the manufacturers would be served by a wellordered fiscal policy, which would protect efficient Australian industries, the majority of which are increasing in efficiency, and are well worthy of protection. That would help Australia to become the great country that it is destined to be. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - My contribution to this debate will be brief. We have been called together to discuss the tariff measure of this Government. We are now in the fourth week of that discussion, and we are still considering the second reading of the bill. The tariff has been debated from every possible angle, and I fail to see that it can be further talked about without a repetition of arguments that have already 'been advanced. It seems to me that the issue was settled last week, when a vote was taken on the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> There the die was cas.t, and we saw the source from which the Government was receiving support for its tariff policy - from both, sections of the Labour party, and from that honorable senator who has proclaimed from Perth to Sydney that nobody in the Federal Parliament is nearer than he is to being a freetrader, but, having changed his outlook, will stand with the two sections of the Labour party in support of the measure brought down by this Government. The Government has the numbers, and it must shoulder the responsibility for this measure, with all its shortcomings, before the voters of Australia. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In view of these circumstances, I wonder why we should continue to waste the time of the Senate, and the resources of the country, in prolonging a debate on an issue that, to all intents and purposes, has been settled by the vote taken here last week. Why waste time in debating the tariff in detail, as, I am afraid,, it will be during the next few weeks? Such a proceeding will be futile If we quickly conclude this  debate,  we shall remove from the minds of business men the doubt which must be occasioned by its continuance, and we shall give those men an opportunity to understand! the conditions under which they are supposed to try to develop their businesses, and the resources of this country. Then they will be able to concentrate on their own affairs. I shall not say more than that; but I should like honorable senators to consider whether it will not be wasting time to repeat arguments that have already been presented. It should be remembered that the industries of Australia can be graded in order of their prosperity, importance, and permanence, and it will be found that those qualities are in inverse ratio to the amount of government support and attention that they have had. I again appeal to honorable senators, and suggest to them that, as practically the issue has already been settled, we should finish the tariff as quickly as possible, and let the Government take the responsibility for the measure. </para>

                        <para>.- Every honorable senator is not gifted to the same degree as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> with ability to condense his remarks effectively ; but I hope that I shall not occupy sufficient time to weary any honorable senator in my contribution to the debate on this most important measure. One has to recognize that, in view of present world conditions, no more important matter than our fiscal policy can be discussed, because on the fiscal policy of the world depends its fate. Much as we in Australia have prided ourselves in the past on being a self-contained country, we are now compelled to realize that we are, and always will be, dependent on the goodwill of other nations. Anything done to maintain the fetish set up by certain sections in Australia will only react to the disadvantage of the Commonwealth. I refer to the fetish which my honorable friends opposite call " protection ", but which i.s more accurately described as "prohibition of trade with any other country ". Under that policy Australia is prepared to sell to other countries, but not to buy from them. Wherever possible, it insists on other nations taking our produce and paying the highest possible price for it. I am pointing out, not the futility of the past action of honorable senators opposite, but the necessity for regarding this matter from a reasonable point of view. </para>

                            <para>- I hope to be able to convert even the honorable senator who now interjects. Those who criticize the Government on this bill are charged with being freetraders; yet I have had no freetrade leanings throughout the whole of my political career. I have always regarded myself as a sound protectionist, but I am careful always to explain the difference between protection anil prohibition. To-day the Government is being assailed by honorable senators on the Opposition side on the ground that it has introduced a low tariff policy, and to justify them in this attitude, they assume that Australia, during the last three years, has had a tariff which has the approval of Parliament. The tariff that has been in operation during that period has never received the approval of this Parliament; it was never submitted to the Parliament by the Ministry which introduced it. That Government acted illegally, because it brought down resolutions providing for a much higher tariff than that now in operation without reference to the Tariff Board, and thus it was imposed contrary to the law of the land. </para>

                        is a disciple of high protection; no tariff can be too high for him. On tariff matters he takes his place with those honorable senators who are associated with the Labour party. He referred to the Ottawa agreement in such terms as to bring it into contempt. He said that the British representatives drove a hard bargain at Ottawa, and he would have us assume that the people of Australia had been victimized to some extent by the agreement; but it is too early to criticize it, because the ink is hardly dry upon it. We have had no proper opportunity to test it; yet
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline>
                        is prepared to condemn it as being one sided. Personally, I believe that it is one sided, to a considerable extent, and that it favours Australia. Under the articles of the agreement, although provision is made for an increase of our British preferential rates, we find that many of the duties on British goods are high enough to be characterized as ' prohibitive.
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">Yet our primary products are being admitted to Great Britain at preferential rates of duty ranging from <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> to 10 per cent. Will any honorable senator deny that that provision is in the best interests of Australia? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> endeavoured to show that we were not reaping any practical advantages from this arrangement owing to the decline in the prices of our primary products. Surely no one will attribute the drop in commodities prices to anything that was done at Ottawa, or by the British representatives at that gathering. Consequently, statements of that character, made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> this afternoon, if intended as criticism of the work of the conference, are hardly worth considering. The honorable gentleman also went on to say that Australia had always been more or less a protectionist country, and supported his argument by mentioning the development that had taken place in protectionist Victoria prior to federation. I have taken the trouble to examine the Victorian tariff of 1893, and have compared the duties imposed by it with duties on similar items in the present schedule. On one item the Victorian ad valorem duty was 35 per cent., whereas the duty in the present Commonwealth schedule is 110 per cent. ; on another item the Victorian ad valorem duty was 45 per cent., and the present Commonwealth duty is 175 per cent. If, on this basis, the Victorian tariff was regarded as highly protectionist in character, what can be said of the present Commonwealth tariff schedule ? </para>
                    <para>When I spoke on the first reading of the bill I made special reference to the prevailing high duties in the Australian tariff, and endeavoured to show that they could not be defended on the ground that they were necessary for the maintenance of the manufacturing industries concerned. The views which I then expressed are fully supported in the supplementary report of the Tariff Board, issued on the 8th December last, dealing with piece goods, woollen or containing wool. Reference to two or three specific items will be sufficient to show how foolish is the policy which successive Commonwealth Governments have been following. . I cite first the duties on worsted materials for men's wear. The </para>
                    <para class="block">Tariff Board's report shows that while the f.o.b. cost of such material in GreatBritain in 1932 was 6s. 9d. a yard, the landed duty-paid cost, under the Scullin tariff of 2s. per square yard, and 35 per cent, ad valorem, but excluding primage and exchange, was 13s. 4d. a yard. As the Australian manufacturers' selling price for comparable material was 6s. 6d. a yard, the landed cost of the British material, under the Scullin tariff, which honorable senators opposite are defending, was twice the price at which the local article could be sold to yield a reasonable profit in Australia. Another item was woollen material used for ladies' dresses. The landed cost under the Scullin tariff was 9s. Id. a yard, whereas similar material was manufactured in Australia and sold at 5s. 5d. a yard. In the face of these figures, can any one say that the Scullin tariff was reasonable protection? </para>

I listened attentively to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran,</inline> who dwelt upon the increased consumption in Australia of locally-grown products during the last 23 years, his purpose being to show that the home market was the most profitable one for our primary producers. The honorable  member  overlooked, or ignored, the increase of population that had taken place during that period, which accounted for the larger absorption of local production, and also forgot to mention that he and his party have, for many years, set their faces definitely against the admission of migrants. How he can reconcile his advocacy of the development of the home market with opposition to immigration proposals, is beyond my understanding; because, obviously, it would  be  impossible, without a very large addition to our present population, to absorb any considerable increase of local production. Apparently honorable senators opposite forget the stock from which we have sprung, and overlook the fact that we owe so much to the courage and enterprise of the pioneers who came from the Mother Country to Australia. </para>

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline>
                        who spoke forcibly, and at some length, to-day, suggested in an interjection when
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline>
                        was speaking, that he had never been enthusiastic about the appointment of the Tariff Board, and, so far as he could remember, had not taken part in the debate on the proposal to set up such a board. The honorable gentleman was correct if, by that, he meant that he had not contributed to the second-reading debate; but he did speak on an amendment moved by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline>
                        to limit the functions of the board. To-day the honorable gentleman suggested that the Government was allowing Australian tariff policy to be dictated by a board, which, he added, was really superseding Parliament, his general attitude on this question conveying the impression that he did not believe in the Tariff Board having any power whatever. As a matter of fact, the board's function is limited to inquiry and report upon matters referred to it. The act provides that before any alteration is made in the tariff, either by way of increasing or decreasing the duties, or by the insertion of a new item, the proposal must be referred to the board, which, after inquiry, submits its report to the Minister, who may thereupon take the necessary action. As the heavy additional duties levied by the Scullin Government three years ago were imposed without reference to the Tariff Board, they were imposed illegally. On the 27th July, 1921,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline>
                        spoke to an amendment moved by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline>
                        the effect of which was to restrict inquiries by the board to items submitted to it by the Minister, instead of being allowed to make inquiries on its own initiative. I take the following from what the honorable senator said on that occasion: -

                        <para>I regard this clause as vital to the bill. In considering the amendment. I ask honorable senators to pay due regard to the obligation which is imposed upon the board by a subsequent clause, to report comprehensively to the Minister each year concerning the operation of the tariff and the development of industries. I cannot see how it is possible for the board to do that unless its members are free to make such inquiries as they may deem to be necessary. </para>
                        <para>If the clause lie amended in the manner that is proposed, or if it be omitted, we shall divest the board of every particle of independence, and practically reduce it to" the level of a political body, which possibly will deal only with such matters as the Minister may consider desirable for party or other purposes to refer to it. . . . If we amend the clause as now proposed, we shall make it impossible for the board to render useful service to the community. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Could there have been a more ardent advocate of the principle underlying the Tariff Board Act than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford?</inline> Yet the honorable senator suggested this afternoon that, because the Tariff Board is carrying out its functions as set out in the act, it is exercising a power greater than that possessed by this Parliament. On the occasion to which I have referred, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> objected to any curtailment of the powers of the Tariff Board. He then contended that the board would be a most useful body - just the very thing the country required - but since it has been in existence, the honorable senator has expressed entirely opposite views. </para>
                    <para>When I spoke to the first reading of this bill, I was not feeling well, and since then I have had eight or ten days' illness. In my earlier speech, 1 made a statement which I have since found was not in accordance with fact. I shall not rectify my error now, but shall do so when the item concerned is under discussion in committee. </para>
                    <para>I hope that the proposal contained in this bill will be accepted by the Senate, for 1 believe that the Government has been actuated by the best intentions. It has had to deal with a situation which has never before arisen in Australia - a tariff schedule imposed on the people contrary to law. Under that illegal act - I use the term advisedly - many new industries sprang up, and others were extended, with the result that there was an over-production of manufactured goods, and the surplus could not be exported. On taking over the reins of office, the Government could not immediately have taken action to make the then existing duties ineffective. We must make the best of the situation which confronts us; we must pay the penalty for the illegal action of a previous government, but as speedily as possible repair the damage done. Let us do it in a commonsense way; let us give a reasonable measure of protection to those industries which need it, and remove from the schedule anything which will tend to create a monopoly. I admit that, at present, many of the things manufactured in Australia are being sold at reasonable prices, and their manufacture here may, in some instances, have reduced, rather than added to the cost of living; but I visualize the possibility in more prosperous times of these monopolies becoming a menace to the community. For that reason, and because I feel that it is essential that we should enter into the spirit of the world to-day, we should revise the schedule in such a way that we shall be able to face the world and say that all that we insist on is a reasonably protective tariff in order to conserve and encourage industries which are vital to the existence of the Commonwealth. </para>

I assure the honorable senator that if the position of the world to-day, which is due to the policy believed in by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> is " anywhere worth while ", we have no desire to alter our fiscal outlook. The last thing that we want to do is to repeat the disastrous performances which have brought the world to its present condition. The honorable senator went on to say that we on this side had set our faces against immigration. I assume that neither the honorable senator himself, nor the party to which he belongs, has done so. Any one who would suggest bringing one solitary immigrant into this country when 300,000 good Australians are compulsorily idle is an anti-Australian of the worst possible kind. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator did not use the words "when immigration was necessary". He said that the party opposite - meaning the party to which I belong - had set their faces against immigration. Another remark made by the honorable senator was that we must repair the damage done by the illegal action of a previous Government. Similar damage to that which is apparent in Australia has been caused in every country in the world. It is for that reason that at this moment an economic conference of world leaders is sitting in London to face problems of great magnitude. The honorable senator would attempt to delude this chamber into the belief that only the "illegal fiscal action of a previous Australian Government " had placed this country in its present unsatisfactory position. . In common with other honorable senators opposite, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> disclaimed the statement that the Tariff Board is the supreme authority in fiscal matters in this country. No one who is capable of understanding the meaning of English can make me believe anything to the contrary, or that he himself believes it. </para>

                    <para>On behalf of the party to which I belong, I protest most vigorously against the Tariff Board being made a superparliament. I object to any body being set up by this Parliament, and given authority to do things which Parliament itself ought to do. The Australian national parliament, meeting in Australia's national capital, and acting on behalf of the electors of Australia, should be the supreme authority in this country; but honorable senators know that it is not the supreme body, and that many of its members are merely puppets who dance to the tune called by the super-parliament set up by this legislature. We have the High Court, the Privy Council, royal commissions, Premiers conferences, the Loan Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, the Tariff Board, economists, professors and experts, all of whom offer advice which is accepted in preference to the common-sense and intelligence of the men who comprise the national parliament of Australia. A World Economic Conference is now sitting in London, yet the members of this Parliament do not know what instructions have been issued to Australia's delegates to that conference. Notwithstanding the weighty problems which will be dealt with at London, the Parliament of Australia as awhole is ignorant of the attitude of the Australian Government towards them. We have, however, a shrewd suspicion of the Government's views. </para>
                    <para>A tariff schedule is a matter of national policy affecting, not only the rates of duty on imported goods, hut also the even bigger question of a White Australia. The present Government's fiscal policy, as contained in this bill, strikes a blow at Australia's national policy of a White Australia. So far as the welfare of the Commonwealth is concerned, there is no essential difference between admitting coloured labour into Australia, and allowing the products of low-wage coloured labour to come in and compete with the products of white labour in Australia. Half a century ago, when I was employed behind a grocery counter, practically everything used in the community was imported, either from England or from some foreign country. The Senate has to decide where it stands in regard to the policy of protection. The Labour party has taken a definite stand on this matter. Some surprise was expressed by honorable senators because, in a recent division, Labour senators supported the Government, and opposed the Country party. The reason was that they had to make their choice between Labour's ideal of a high tariff, the Government's ideal of a low tariff, and the Country party's ideal of no tariff at all. </para>
                    <para>We on this side do not underestimate the serious complexity of this problem. I think that it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins who, in referring to the tangle of industrial awards in Australia, said that they had got into a " Serbonian bog" of difficulty. That is exactly the kind of mess that we are getting into in connexion with tariff matters. The only comforting thought is that the difficulty is manmade, and it should be possible for the genius of our people to find a way out of the morass. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not expect honorable senators opposite to be able to grasp the splendid idealism that is contained in those words. We on this side are being continually accused of being merely destructive critics. However, as we indulge in our destructive criticism, we rarely fail to substitute a constructive policy for the faulty one which meets with our disfavour. Quite naturally, we have to support a destructive policy, because we believe that the world has ; been brought to such a state of misery and despair that matters can be set right only by first destroying the existing order of things, and then constructing our ideal in its place. One writer uses these words, which epitomises the position admirably: "We produce so much of everything that we have not enough of anything." </para>

Thomas, the  chairman  of the Dried Fruits Board, when interviewed by the Australian Press Association, said that he had already found that conditions for the selling of dried fruits were worse than on previous seasons. This was duo to the heavy stocks of foreign imports. The foreign fruits poured into Britain in 1932 in anticipation of the Ottawa Treaty. This year's total of foreign arrivals was double that of 1931. " The Australian crop is particularly large - almost a record," he said. "The board is now planning a vigorous and continuous selling campaign, in the hope of attracting buyers to view the good Australian values offering."

            <para>The latest interpretation of the benevolent Ottawa agreement is from New Zealand. Under this it is announced that the sister dominion is about to raise its tariff wall against a considerable number of Australian products. The new increased duties on imports from Australia cover the following: On and from 1st June, cut and plug manufactured tobacco; on and from 1st August, confectionery, fresh apricots, cherries, grapes, peaches, plums, tomatoes, cigarettes, spirits, floor coverings, apparel, and hosiery, fur skins and made-up furs, glass bottles, and jars, china ware, fancy goods, sporting requisites, toilet preparations, motor vehicles, sashes, and doors. </para>

                <para class="block">I hope that I shall have the opportunity to talk of doing something of that nature in Australia a little later on.

                    <para>Here at hand in the flesh, in the can, in the bale, and in the bolt, is a visible part of the inventory of the biggest sales organization in the world, ready to furnish anything from worm medicine for overfed  lapdogs  to marble gravestones and linen doilies, ready to meet and cut anybody's price from cotton to coal! lt is an astonishing exhibition, and Soviet macaroni in Italy is only one of its revelations. There in a corner is a stand taller than a man, brilliantly lit with thin-necked globular electric light bulbs. They are for sale. They are Soviet products. Three years ago the best the Soviet Union could do in the way of producing instruments, of illumination was to turn out with the help of Swedish concessionaires poor-quality kerosene lanterns. Today they are exporting electric light bulbs indistinguishable to the layman from the most modern products of American or German factories. Patents, it may be remarked, are one of the least of Soviet worries. . . . </para>
                    <para>Here are wheat, 39 varieties, and flour, four kinds, for white bread - last seen in Russia in 1928. Here arc six sorts of cornmeal, eleven of benns, and four grades of sugar. Last autumn in the considerable city of Dnepropetrovsk we could find no sugar. Distribution difficulties were to blame, we were told, and it is true that sugar was available everywhere else <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> through the Soviet Union. But distribution runs smoother when the outlet is abroad and foreign currency the goal. </para>
                    <para>Here are 20 sorts of peas and seed vegetables, barley, oats, rye, and, finally, the macaroni. Not just macaroni though, but all calibres in between, from finger-thick noodles to hair-fine vermicelli. In this department is material for every sort of nutriment, from French pastry, to mast for swine. </para>
                    <para>Every department has its director, anxious to distribute literature, ready to explain that the objects on exhibition arc only a fraction of those the Soviet Union could supply. . . . </para>
                    <para>One whole section is devoted to petroleum and every conceivable variety of petroleum product, and another to lumber and wood products, now the largest Soviet export. Here are parquet floorings, plywood, ready-made doors, sashes, sawn timber, planks. </para>
                    <para>Upstairs are rugs, antique and new; 41 kinds of bristles; 18 of feathers; 12 sorts of sausage casings; 24 samples of hemp goods, including ropes, mats and nets; 25 kinds of horse-hair; 05 of furs; 150 examples of fine porcelain; two shelves full of common crockery; a whole department for peasant handwork - toys, dolls, embroidered linen, balalaikas and mandolins. </para>
                    <para>Downstairs, on the other side, we came up short before three bales of Russian cotton. In 1928, the first year of the five-year plan, the Soviet Union imported nearly 500,000 bales of cotton, 300,000 of them from the United States of America. </para>
                    <para>A short distance from the baled cotton stand cases of textile samples. More than 300 varieties of Soviet cotton and linen goods are offered for sale. </para>
                    <para>We hurry along past 30 kinds of hides :ind leather; waterproofing oil; wax; vermifuge for dogs; 93 kinds of chemicals, prepared and raw; 15 sorts of granite and marble; a case of semi-precious stones; and 45 kinds of other minerals; and pause once more before a corner full of silk - raw silk and silk cocoons. There is much to learn in the Soviet trade exhibit. Lost year Italy bought more than £200.000 worth of cocoons and about £40,000 worth of raw silk from the Soviet Union, where a pair of silk stockings is rarer than white bread. </para>

The point that I wish to make on this matter of vital policy is that the nations which are assembled at the World Economic Conference in London will not do anything that will be of value to Australia. With Australia, those nations are faced with the tremendous flood of exports which will come, not only from Russia, but also from every other highly industrialized country .that is engaging in a policy of intense economic development and nationalism, and is becoming less and less dependent on other countries.

Despite the dreadful tragedy of present day conditions, and the destruction of so much that is dear to most of us, we have presented to our notice a picture which would be farcical if it were not so tragic, of the elect of the peoples of the world sitting in solemn conclave at that Economic Conference unable to concentrate their thoughts because they are not allowed to smoke, while millions remain unemployed and, even in this wonderful continent of ours, hundreds of thousands go hungry. </para>

The MacDonald Government sent the official d'Abernon mission to the Argentine Government and obtained an agreement giving Britain many millions of dollars' worth of trade which had been going to the United States, and which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoover</inline> hoped to retain on the strength of his Argentine tour a few months earlier.

I convinced the Canadians that some of that should come from England and Wales, because every 300 tons mined in this country means enough work to support a miner and his family one year." - and he, might have added, means work taken away from American miners of whom tens of thousands are unemployed, and other tens of thousands arc on part time.

I hold the view, and my party also, that a tariff which brings in revenue is not a protective tariff, and that the more revenue it brings in, the less protective it is. When it can be demonstrated that we can produce in Australia a commodity equal in' quality to the imported article and sell it at practically the same price, it should be made a penal offence to bring the im-' ported article into this country. By importing articles which can be made effectively in Australia, we give employment to people overseas instead of to the people within our own shores.

Honorable senators are paid a salary for doing this kind of work, and that salary is increased when an honorable senator becomes a cabinet minister. Why should we who are paid to frame the tariff policy of the country be everlastingly transferring our responsibility to outside bodies which are in no way answerable to the electors for their actions, thus shirking our own responsibilities?

                <para class="block">First of all, the Minister stated that tariff making would be undertaken through the Tariff Board, and not by arbitrary ministerial action, but afterwards, he obviously became doubtful of the wisdom of announcing such a clear-cut  tariff programme, and he watered it down by saying that the Government would be "guided largely by the recommendations of the Tariff Board." But the Ottawa agreement provides that no existing duties shall be increased on the United Kingdom goods to an amount in excess of the recommendation of the Tariff Board. The Government, therefore, must, in certain instances, accept the recommendation of the board. The Minister also stated - lt is most remarkable that we should bc considering a tariff schedule at the present stage, and particularly on the eve of the World Economic  Conference,  at which the tariff policy of each government will be submitted to the most searching scrutiny. It is to be hoped that, at this conference, the futility of adopting prohibitory tariffs and trade restrictions will be fully appreciated, and that future world policy will be in the direction of freeing the channels of trade from the obstructions designedly, but in good faith, placed upon them. </para>
                <para class="block">What does that statement mean? It means that we are to adopt a policy which will remove restrictions of trade brought about by the operation of the tariff. Such an action would be entirely opposed to the will of the people, and to the election promises of this Government. The Minister made use of this pregnant remark - </para>

Even if prosperity should return to certain sections of the community, it would mean nothing to the people who are sheltering in shacks which let in the rain, and shivering because of the winter's cold, and whose women and children are ill provided for. We cannot tell those people that the corner has been turned, and that the worst is past. Prosperity will never return to Australia unless we adopt a prohibitive fiscal policy, and place round this continent a tariff wall which will make it self-contained, and enable the people at least to live under decent standards, and free altogether from the frightful and horrible competition of Japan, Great Britain, Denmark, the Argentine, Czechoslovakia, and other countries, which are pouring their products into this country.

                    <para>The Minister in charge of the bill went on to say that "every debtor nation, in order to meet its obligations as far as possible, and to save its currency from collapse, had to limit its imports, knowing full well that those imports were its neighbour's exports." That was exactly what the Scullin Government did. That Government limited imports for two reasons. If it did not, the volume of our export surplus would not have been sufficient to correct our adverse trade balance on the other side of the world. But it 'also limited imports - which were our neighbour's exports - for another reason: Every time we make an article in Australia, we have the article and the money it costs to make it, inside the country ; but every time we buy an article from another country, we have the article, while the other country has the money and the employment. One honorable senator, in his hysteria, referred to the "illegal fiscal acts of the Scullin Government," which, he said, had got Australia into the mess it is in to-day. The Minister in charge of the bill said that, until the cost of production in secondary industries was scaled down to a point more in relation to the price of raw materials, there could be no real improvement. What does that mean ? It is always a good thing, when examining the speeches of somebody opposed to you, to try to visualize his point of view. There are two sides to every argument. That was said at a political meeting not long ago by a candidate who was anxious to ingratiate himself with the electors whose votes he was seeking. He recognized, he said, that there were two sides to every question, and his hearers were entitled to their own opinions. A wag at the back of the hall called out that there were two sides to every flypaper, but it made a great deal of difference to the fly which side he landed on. The Minister in charge of the bill said that there could be no real improvement until prices were scaled  down.  Well, how far down? There is only one meaning behind that statement. In his opinion we must get our production costs down to the lowest standard existing in any country that produces the same article. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline></para>

                        commenced his speech by saying that we all had high hopes of Ottawa. I desire to wash my  hands of that statement. I expected nothing from Ottawa; I got nothing from Ottawa, and Australia has got- nothing from it. It does not matter how much honorable senators opposite may try to deceive themselves, and persuade the primary producers that they got something out of Ottawa; the producers themselves know that ,they  got  noth-ing  out of it. The honorable senator also said that he had high., hopes of the World Economic Conference, now meeting in London. I make, this prophecy : Nothing will emerge from that conference except talk; because not one of the delegates dares to go. ''back to. his own country, and tell those who sent him that the only way out of the difficulty is to adopt the Labour party's policy. That policy provides that, instead of production, distribution and exchange pf wealth being carried on for private profit, we should reverse the process, and carry them on for the public benefit. None of the delegates is game to go back and make that statement, but salvation exists nowhere else. None of them, will go back and say that at last the people should have intelligence and moral courage enough to demand that the finance of their country should be taken away from the criminal control of private enterprise, of private dividend-mongering, ' profit-making banks and other financial institutions, and that the nation's credit should be used for the nation's needs, so that it may do good work for the whole of the community.

                        went on to  say that our interest payments should be accounted to us as part of the value Australia is to Great Britain. As a matter of fact they are so accounted now. They are not paid in cash : they are paid in goods, and we get full credit for all the goods we sent to Great Britain.

In my opinion, the sooner we concentrate on exports for the purpose only of discharging existing liabilities, and not for the purpose of buying abroad goods which can 'be produced in Australia, the better it will be for all of us. How long do we intend, to produce tons and tons of goods, much of which we could consume ourselves if we were given an opportunity, but which now, in the final analysis, have the effect merely of reducing the standard of living of the primary producers? But how else are we to pay our overseas debts, honorable senators may ask? Let us decide, now that Australia's jamboree has lasted long enough, that we have been living in a fool's paradise long enough, borrowing money long enough, and too long piling up burdens for posterity. State and Commonwealth Governments went on gaily year after year borrowing money overseas. We said, with a magnanimous wave of the hand, "We must pass some of this on tu&gt;  preterity."  Unfortunately, we are posterity; we are experiencing the bitter aftermath, the morning after the night before. If we are to be honest to posterity let us decide now that we shall put the peg in. Let there be no more borrowing abroad. Let Australia be a self-contained nation. Some of us may have to go short of some of the things which we have been educated to believe are necessities, but which, in reality, are not. We m'ay have to get back to a less complex form of existence, but let us get back to it. Then, in a little virile, this nation, proceeding along right Lines and giving the common people a cil mee,' will be able to produce, not only the necessities, but also those things which are called luxuries. </para>

Further than that, over six years' trading, to 1930, Australia was the only country in the world to give Britain a credit balance. What an effective reply to the croakers in this, country! </para>

                    <para>I was interested, on entering the chamber the other evening, to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> expatiating on brotherhood. L do not know whether it was my patriarchal and benevolent appearance that prompted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> to refer to me as " the elder brother ", but I accepted the remark as a sincere compliment. If there is one thing that I believe in more than another, it is brotherhood. I waited to hear the words that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> had to say on the subject of brotherhood, but I waited in vain, for he did not utter them. I ask honorable senators opposite whether brotherhood is possible to-day? It becomes less and less possible. The Golden Rule is an impossibility, because brotherhood has been made impossible. To-day, in consequence of economic insecurity and the problem of not knowing where to-morrow's dinner is coming from, nation is competing against nation, State against State, town against town, and individual against individual. The tens of thousands of young men and women of whom Lord Melchett said, that "if they stand in queues for 50 years and answered advertisements by every post " they would not find work, for they would be unemployable, know all too well that brotherhood is a dream that cannot be realized. If honorable senators would exercise some constructive statesmanship we might be able to improve things a little. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes,</inline> in railing against high tariffs, asked why we should impose a duty of 45 per cent. against boots made in Great Britain, thus preventing the down-at-heel people in this country from buying them. Does not the honorable gentleman realize that these people cannot buy Australian boots made of Australian material by Australian workmen in Australian factories? How then could they buy British boots? The honorable senator must know that they could not do anything of the kind. The same honorable gentleman said that we should never lose sight of the importance of the primary producers who are mainly responsible for our export business. Honorable senators of the Labour party do not lose sight of the primary producers. We are interested in them, not only because of the exportable goods which they produce, but also for other reasons which I have already mentioned. We say that this country should stop borrowing abroad, for that policy only increases the load of debt which we have to carry, and which we are expected to pay off, not by the yardstick of 12 inches, which was in use when the money was borrowed, but by the yardstick which, without any authority from this country, has been increased to 23 inches. </para>

                        <inline font-style="italic">ad misericordiam</inline>
                        appeal for weeks by honorable senators opposite on behalf of the wool and meat producers of this country. The Government has been besieged with requests to do something for the wool producers, and to stimulate the meat industry. But what is the good of talking about increasing our exportable surplus when our producers arefinding it increasingly difficult to produce at a profit? I believe it is true that some of them are to-day producing at a loss. The fact is that the nations of the world are becoming less and less dependent uponus for wheat and meat. Wool is the only thing that Australia is now producing that the nations of the world must buy from us, and it will not be long before they will be able to do without our wool. They are doing without our wheat, butter, cheese, and meat to an ever-increasing extent.

                        was speaking, and I believe that he was sincere when he said that the men engaged in secondary industries were not pioneers, but were protected, and that the men engaged in primary production were pioneers, but were not protected. I cannot imagine

                        being insincere in anything, but that remark almost tempts me to test the strength of the honorable gentleman's sincerity.

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Badman</inline> had exercised common sense hewould not have made such an interjection. He and his colleagues seem to confine their attention to effects.

Of course they are pioneers. I should also like to see what senators from Victoria would do if an attempt were made to withdraw protection from the potato and oniongrowers, and the butter producers, of that State. If the duty of 6d. per lb. on New Zealand butter, and the assistance given to the dairy-farmers by the Paterson scheme, were withdrawn there would be trouble. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> who usually prefaces anything of a particularly caustic nature that he has . to say to honorable senators on this side of the chamber, with the words " with all respect to my friends ", would be very annoyed if any move of the kind that I have suggested were made. </para>

                            <para>- When ye have an honest government, it will see that the people are not robbed. Oliver Wendel Holmes once said that there are only two classes in the community - those who go ahead and do things, and those who merely stand off and criticize. I think that he was about right. But another author, less eminent in the literary world, has said that the only two classes in the community are those who do the work, and those who " do " the workers. That is true in Australia to-day. On the fiscal issue, gibes are thrown at us by honorable 'senators opposite. It is incorrectly stated - and all their gibes are inaccurate - that by the " worker " we mean only the man who wears bowyangs, and has corns on his hands. Let us hear no more of that unfair charge, because the Labour movement's definition of a worker is, " Every member of the community who is rendering useful service to the community, no matter what the nature of that service may be ". </para>

            <para>It would be no use giving the money to those who are playing the safety v game. If the Government, receiving the credit from the bank, handed it over to those whose desire is to save every penny they receive, then the result would be nil. We must avoid this plague of safety seeking. As a sheer necessity for trade revival, we must give the money to those who are so needy that they will rush to the counter with it, for they are the only people who can be relied upon to spend the money and create new trade. </para>
            <para>There is only one sure way we can escape national bankruptcy - that is, to print notes and give them, not to those who now seek safety, but to the destitute, the unemployed and pensioners.

                    <para>The Cabinet was called after the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald, had received a despatch from the British Ambassador to Washington, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ronald</inline> Lindsay. The result of the Cabinet meeting was not disclosed, but it is known that some Ministers are urging default if America adheres to its refusal to accept the token payment. </para>
                    <para>Such a course undoubtedly would receive the support of the majority of the delegates to: the conference. France has already defaulted in the payment which was due last December, and it is regarded as certain that she will againdefault in the June payment. </para>
                    <para>The main topic in London to-day was concerned with the manner in which' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MacDonald</inline> took the war debts bit in his teeth at the opening of the. conference yesterday. Notwithstanding the fact that the leader of the American delegation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hull,</inline> stated only on Friday last that the war debts could not be a matter for this, conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MacDonald</inline> emphatically declared that " the question must be dealt with before every obstacle to general recovery has been removed, and it must be taken up without delay by the nations concerned."; </para>
                    <para class="block">As we have in London aResident Minister without portfolio leading the Australian delegation at. the World Economic Conference, I endeavoured, this morning, to ascertain if the Government had given instructions, as to the attitude to be observed by that gentleman towards this important issue, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> with his usual adroitness, gave what I regarded as a " wipe-off " to my question. I. do not in tend to take such treatment lying down. SenatorRae and I, as the representatives of the Australian Labour party of New South Wales in this chamber, were elected by the people of New South Wales, and we are in exactly the same position as is the right honorable gentleman himself, as a representative of Western Australia. To-day we have been obliged to wait approximately twelve hours for the opportunity on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, to bring to the notice of the Government matters which we consider should be ventilated. If the, right honorable gentleman thinks that he is going to treat us always as I was treated this morning, I tell him plainly that, on every possible occasion, we shall take full advantage of the Senate Standing Orders to ventilate our grievances. We are entitled to information as to the attitude of the Government to the World Economic Conference. It is all very well for the Leader of the Senate and his colleagues to sit smiling on the front bench- </para>
