                    <para>The proposal of the 15th September referred to in the honorable senator's question ottered as an alternative rifle range sitean area at Glenorchy. It has been necessary to survey this area (over which the Hobart City Council has obtained options) with a view to ascer- taining its suitabilityas a rifle range. This survey has just been completed, and many points have arisen which require further investigation, but it is anticipated that the Defence Department will be able to give a definite reply to the Hobart City Council's proposal by the end of this year. </para>

                    <para>[3.18]. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - During the past few weeks the Loan Council has been in close touch with the High Commissioner in London, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> in connexion with negotiations for a further conversion loan. It was hoped that an operation would have been announced earlier; but, unfortunately, conditions in the international monetary world had become unfavorable, and the operation was delayed. Despite these conditions, negotiations have been carried on, and the Loan Council has authorized <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> to arrange for a further conversion loan of £16,647,000. The negotiations are approaching finality, and it is expected that a loan for this amount will be underwritten in London to-day. The operation will cover £2,980,000 of New South Wales 5½ per cents., £6,888,000 of Victorian 5½ per cents., £5,633,000 of South Australian 5 per cents., and £1,146,000 of Tasmanian 5 per cents. It is expected that the terms will be 3¾ per cent. at £99 for fifteen years, with the. option to the Government to repay after twelve years. On these terms, the yield to the investor, allowing for redemption at the end of fifteen years, would be £3 16s. 9d. The last conversion operation was for £20,951,000, the terms being 3¾ per cent;, at £98, and the period twenty years, with the option of redemption after fifteen years. The yield to the investor in the case of that operation, including redemption at the end of twenty years, was £3 17s.11d. It will be seen, therefore, that the proposed terms of the now loan are a slight improvement on theterms on which the last conversion loanwas arranged. As was the case with earlier conversions, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed to the proposed issue as an exceptional measure. As soon as advice has been received that the loan has been underwritten, a further announcement will be made. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to provide £100,000 to meet monetary grants to certain migrant settlers in Victoria. The question whether this liability should be accepted by the Commonwealth or whether the whole or any portion of it should be borne by the State of Victoria, is to be referred to arbitration in terms of an arbitration agreement entered into between the Governments of the Commonwealth and Victoria, dated the 16th October, 1933, a copy of which is annexed to this bill. The Honorable Langer Owen will act as arbitrator. </para>
                    <para>What is described as the " Tentative Government Scheme", also annexed to the bill, defines how the. sum of £100,000 shall be applied. In certain cases monetary grants are to be made to settlers still on their holdings, and in other cases grants are to be made to settlers not now in occupation of blocks. The maximum payment proposed will not in any one case exceed £500. In addition, a sum not exceeding £8,000 is to be provided to meet pressing personal debts of settlers. The money will not be used for adjustment of capital or areas of holdings. Those responsibilities already have been accepted by the Government of Victoria. I think I should explain shortly the history of this matter, although the delicacy of the situation forbids the discussion of the question of who should bear the blame. That has been left for the arbitrator to decide, and for th* present is <inline font-style="italic">sub</inline><inline font-style="italic">judice.</inline></para>
                    <para>On the 31st May, 1922, the United Kingdom Government passed an act known as The Empire Settlement Act 1922. That act provided for co-operation, financial and otherwise, between the United Kingdom and the dominions, in the better distribution of the white population of the Empire. Being desirous of entering into such co-operative arrangement, and obtaining the financial and other advantages likely to accrue from such co-operation, the Commonwealth Government concluded certain agreements with the United Kingdom Government and with the various States, including Victoria. The United Kingdom Government dealt with the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth in turn dealt with the States. Pursuant to those agreements, certain assisted migrants came to Australia and were settled on the land in Victoria. Following the passage of the Empire Settlement Act, a series of conferences was held between Commonwealth and State Ministers for the purpose of considering, among other matters, the subject of migration and its concomitant development. Those conferences decided to draw a line of demarcation as to responsibility in respect of migration as between the Commonwealth and States. </para>
                    <para>Briefly - (1) the Commonwealth was to have full control overseas; and (2) the States were to assume full responsibility for settlement. Consequent upon this arrangement, the Commonwealth during  1922 proceeded to assume control of certain matters overseas, including recruitment and propaganda relating to migration; hut, notwithstanding the measure of control that the Commonwealth sought to exercise, recruiting in respect of Victorian land settlement schemes was, in fact, conducted by certain officers specially selected for the work by the Government of Victoria. To facilitate recruitment, these officers used, in the main, literature which bore the imprimatur of the State of Victoria. It is the view of the Commonwealth Government that those officers acted, although they were nominally under Commonwealth control, as the agents of Victoria. This matter is, however, <inline font-style="italic">sui judice.</inline> I stress particularly the division of responsibility as between the Commonwealth and the State, and the alleged manner in which those responsibilities were discharged in respect of the recruitment of migrants, because this matter constitutes the basic difference of opinion as between the Commonwealth a.nd. the State of Victoria, and has necessitated recourse to arbitration. </para>
                    <para>In response to insistent representations by migrant settlers in Victoria, and later by the British Government, a royal commission was appointed by the State of Victoria on the 9th December, 1930, to investigate complaints of settlers. The personnel of the commission was His Honour Chief Justice Dethridge, Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, Chairman; and Messrs. Olive McPherson and W. E. B. Macleod as Commissioners. The commission furnished its report on the 21st March, 1933. Altogether the commission dealt with the cases of 311 complainant settlers, and found tha.t most of the complaints were justified. In short, the commission found - </para>

                    <para>In its general conclusion as to obligations the commission expressed the view that the migrants, not being parties to the agreements, had no ordinary contractual rights thereunder, but although the complainants have no rights under the agreements enforceable in law, there are special circumstances in nearly every case which give them a just claim upon the State for the fulfilment of the agreements so far as the State undertook, by those agreements, to confer benefits upon persons in the position of the complainants. </para>
                    <para>While the Government of Victoria is prepared to make substantial adjustments in respect of writing-off of capital, and in regard to areas of holdings, in cases where settlers remain on their blocks, involving in all, I am informed, a liability of about £350,000, it disclaims responsibility for monetary grants, because it does not agree that the State is responsible for misleading propaganda and for misleading statements that were made in Britain. </para>
                    <para>The whole question has formed the subject of protracted negotiations, and I am pleased to be able to say that the United Kingdom Government is prepared to accept the basis of settlement as set out in what is described as the Tentative Government Scheme. As already indicated, however, the Government of Victoria is not prepared, except upon the decision of the arbitrator, to provide the whole or any portion of the amount required for monetary grants. While the Commonwealth Government does not admit that a legal claim for compensation lies on the part of the settlers, it nevertheless recognizes that certain moral claims exist. The formula of settlement proposed is intended to satisfy those moral claims. </para>
                    <para>The object of the bill is to provide the money now, so that a speedy settlement may be reached. The sum of £100,000 represents an estimate. The amount required might be less or it might be more than that sum. If more money is required, additional funds will be appropriated later, but it is emphasized that the provision of the money is in no way to be construed as an admission by the Commonwealth that it has any financial or other responsibilities in respect of these migrants. The purpose of the bill is simply to facilitate settlement, because it is felt that further delay will prove inimical to the interests of Australia overseas. </para>

                        <para>Under the £34,000,000 agreement, the Commonwealth Government has a definite and seriousresponsibility to the British Government in respect of the satisfactory settlement of all assisted migrants who come to Australia. The agreements with the States, although providing for the division of this responsibility, do not, iu any way, absolve the Commonwealth Government from its obligations to the British Government. In every case the. British Governmentlooks to the Commonwealth Government to honour its compact, although the whole machinery of settlement lies in the hands of the respective State Governments. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>In accepting the basis of settlement proposed, and consenting to provide funds pending the results of arbitration, the Commonwealth Government was actuated by a desire to see remedies applied with as little delay as possible, because it is considered . that speed should be the primary aim of any basis of settlement. Any involved and long-drawn-out methods would necessarily detract from the effectiveness of a scheme, no matter how liberal the provisions might be. It is recognized that the formula which has been agreed to is not perfect - it would be futile to attempt to evolve a perfect formula - but, in the opinion' of the Government, it represents an honest attempt to confer the greatest benefits upon the greatest number. No embracive scheme of this character would be likely to satisfy every one. A further point, too, is that there is a limit to the funds which can be made available for the purpose. An endeavour has been made to provide for the utilization of funds within those limits to the best advantage. </para>
                    <para>The Senate must either accept or reject the schedule in its entirety. It represents an agreement as between governments which is unalterable as to detail. However, in considering the matter, cognisance should be taken of the fact that the real object of the bill is to provide the sum of £100,000 pending the results of arbitration. It is scarcely within the province of the Senate to express views as to the merits of the formula of settlement. The formula has been accepted by the British Government, thereby removing any obstacle in the way of its operation. </para>
                    <para>In asking the Senate to pass this legislation, I desire to emphasize that because unfortunate circumstances have surrounded this scheme of settlement, it cannot be said that the whole scheme of migration was a failure. Indeed, there are many striking instances of success, and it must he remembered that the problem of population, so far as Australia is concerned, is of transcendent importance. Economic depression always will have a restricting influence, and the tendency will be for settlers, in time of adversity, to think that the distant fields are green. By this I mean that, in times of depression, they will feel the urge to return to their native land, but I stress the fact that Australia is to-day in a far better economic position: than most other countries of the world. </para>
                    <para>I hope that honorable senators will forbear debating the merits or demerits of the original proposal. I have endeavoured to avoid discussing whether or not literature that was issued in connexion with the migration campaign was the responsibility of the Commonwealth or of the Government of Victoria. This matter will be argued by the representatives of the Commonwealth and the State concerned on the admitted facts, and the arbitrator will determine where (he responsibility lies. I ask for the speedy passage of the bill. </para>

                        <para>.- While I agree with the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> that there is little to be gained from recriminations with regard to the migration scheme that ended so disastrously, it is only right that I should review briefly the history of the project. When the proposals to settle people on land in Australia were under discussion in 1922, the Victorian Government brought forward a scheme to place 10,000 migrants from Great Britain on the land in that State over a period of five years. A contract to that effect was made with the Commonwealth and Imperial Governments, and a bill dealing with it was introduced into this Parliament in October of that year. The then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> referring to the financial side of the scheme, said that an advance of £1,000 was to be made by the British Government in respect of each settler, and that the Commonwealth Government would be liable for one-third of the interest payable, the Victorian Government being responsible for the balance. The right honorable gentleman clearly indicated that the liability of the Commonwealth was limited both as regards time and amount. Notwithstanding that statement, I agree with the Vice-President of the Executive Council that whatever might have been the understanding arrived at, although there might be no legal responsibility on the Commonwealth in respect of the scheme, there is certainly a moral obligation to have it satisfactorily settled. This, I think, is admitted by the Minister who has stated that the points in dispute between the Commonwealth and the State of Victoria will be determined by arbitration. </para>

                    <para>When the bill dealing with this project was under discussion in 1922, members of the Labour party were most emphatic in their condemnation of it. Subsequent events have proved that there was no justification for the encouragement of migrants "from Great Britain. We realized the danger of placing on the land newcomers inexperienced in agricultural operations under Australian conditions, knowing that there was no lack of demand on the part of people living here for any land that might be available. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton,</inline> the then Leader of the Labour party, emphasized that inexperienced men would be confronted with a heartbreaking task. </para>

Everyone now knows that many migrants were allotted land . that was most unsuitable. The Victorian Government had launched, in a most haphazard fashion, a land settlement scheme which has proved most expensive to the community. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the then Prime Minister, informed members of the House of Representatives that the 'Premier of Victoria, had told him that he proposed to sandwich migrant settlers on land be tween Australian farmers, in the belief that the experience which they would gain from their neighbours would enable them to succeed. That might have been a wise provision; but, as we now know, the migrants were placed on inferior land, and thus were handicapped from the start. Victoria is becoming notorious for its land settlement schemes, and it is just as well that the people should be warned of the folly of adopting ill-considered proposals. I do not know what is the present position of soldier settlements in that State, but according to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 7th July, 1926, they were a disgrace to the State.

The monetary arrears on tha transactions amount to £3,000,000. In the vast majority of these cases, the unfortunate settler is not to blame. Much of the land was unsuitable. Seemingly good laud was subject to flooding, and was in parts imperfectly drained. Many values wore excessive; many areas were inadequate. </para>

                    <para class="block">Both in regard to soldier and migrant settlements, the Victorian Government of the day either showed a shocking lack of foresight, inasmuch as it did not secure land that could be worked successfully, or was totally indifferent to the fate of its settlers. It is difficult to believe that any government could be so callous about the welfare of returned soldiers as to settle them on unsuitable land. Men whose patriotism during the war was at fever heat, took advantage of the opportunity which the Government's land settlement proposals presented, and asked excessive values for land upon which it was impossible for the new settlers to make a living. Members of the Labour party pointed. out at the time that the cheap money to be made available under the agreement with the British Government would, in the long run, prove to be dear money. Australia now has to pay for the folly and shortsightedness of previous anti-Labour governments. Alleged patriots "sold a pup " to the British settlers, who were, misled because of their ignorance of Australian conditions. They were led like lambs to' the slaughter, and I am sorry to say that Australians did their best to deceive them. Glowing pictures were painted to attract them to this country. A circular letter referred to on page 3 of th)e report of the Victorian royal' commission that inquired into this matter stated - </para>

                    <para class="block">Men who had had military careers in India, and were living in retirement in Great Britain, were particularly appealed to, and were induced to take up land in Australia. Imagine a British migrant being regarded as qualified for life on the land after twelve months' farming experience! As a matter of fact, many of them did not receive even a year's training. </para>
                    <para>In 1926, 3,947 applications were received for one homestead farm, and, in 1927, no fewer than 170 applicants attempted to secure nine blocks of land. This shows conclusively that any good land that is available for settlement is quickly taken up by Australians who are familiar _ with local conditions. A number of single migrants were placed on farms because, usually, they were prepared to accept low wages, to be assured of at least a living for such period as suited the employer; but married migrants could not take their families with them when they were obtaining experience by working for other farmers. As a' 'result, married men with families were placed on blocks as soon as possible, willy-nilly, whether they had had experience or not, and they were left to make the best of their opportunities. In January, 1924, the Elcho training farm was established, and married men were given a rough idea of farming at that institution; but they received only about six weeks' experience.

                        <para>. - I welcome this bill, which is rather overdue; but I join issue with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> in regard to his statement that the error was due to the action of unscrupulous governments. After the war, it was realized by many thinking men that a re-distribution of the man power of the Empire was feasible and wise. The mistake that occurred in. connexion with this effort at migration was repeated in many countries. I saw something of it over twenty years ago in Rhodesia. Australian ex-service men on their return from abroad at the termination of the Great War had experiences similar to those of the migrant settlers, and so had the ex-service men in New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa. After the cessation of hostilities, a period of fictitious prosperity was experienced. Values soared to remarkable heights, and these conditions were common throughout the world. When I returned to my own State of Tasmania, I was astonished at the prices asked for land suitable for the cultivation of potatoes. Such fictitious values could not be maintained. Returned soldiers and other settlers who were placed upon land purchased at a price in excess of its economic value, were handicapped from the outset. Neither governments nor experts in the various State agricultural departments anticipated that the difficulties confronting these men would be as great as they actually were, and that there would be such a large number of failures. Members of local committees, many of whom were successful farmers, recommended the purchase of land which they thought would be suitable for settlement. Moreover, a large number of " diggers " who had been on the land before they went, overseas to fight have been faced with serious difficulties and the efforts of many of them have been attended by complete failure. I was immigration officer for the State of Tasmania for some time, and I have always been intensely interested in migration and land settlement. There have been a number of failures, but many of these were inevitable owing to the settlers being temperamentally unsuitable and inexperienced. Some have been successful, and I could take honorable senators to quite a number who came out from the Old Country ut that time and have done well. I cannot agree with the statement of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> that the position of certain Victorian migrants, who are being provided for under this bill, is due to the action of unscrupulous governments. That statement is inaccurate and misleading; the governments concerned were not unscrupulous. When these migrants came to Australia, governments in various parts of the Empire were competing with each other in an endeavour to obtain migrants and to increase land settlement. They were " painting the lily, " in order to secure men and particularly those with capital. On two occasions, I visited the Elcho training farm, at Lara, to see how migrants were progressing before being placed on blocks which they were to work on their own account.  Since that time I have met five or six of them who intend, if possible, to remain on their blocks and who anticipate receiving some financial assistance under this measure . Negotiations proceeded between the British Government, the Commonwealth Government and the Victorian Government for some time; and eventually a royal commissionwas appointed, to inquire into the whole matter. Some of the findings of that commission have been quoted by the Leader of the Opposition and many of them,I think, are sound. I welcome the; introduction of this measure, and I hope thatt it will be passed by the Senate, as- it is the least that can be done to correct what was really an error of judgment. </para>

                        <para>. -  In view of the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> that a. firm of Melbourne solicitors is pressing certain persons who may be. afforded some relief under this measure, the action of the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> is fully justified. I do not intend to support the second reading of the bill, which is to appropriate £100,000 in order to afford relief to certain migrant  settlers in Victoria,' while there are thousands of workers in Australia to-day whose position is quite as bad as thosewhom the Government proposes to assist. There are 4,000 men on the northern coalfields of New South Wales who, through no fault of their own, have not had work; for six years. </para>

                            <para>- I am contending that if the Government can find £100,000 tocompensate certain migrants who settled in Victoria, it should be able to providesufficient money to relieve unemployment, particularly in New South Wales. My opposition to the measure would not be so great if the settlers were to receive the money to be appropriated, but I regard the Government's proposals as a " ramp " or a " racket " in the interests of " big business " in Victoria. These "boodleiers" intend to whip in their garnishee orders- </para>

                            <para>- It is robbery within the law. Certain business men in Collins-street are intimidating these unfortunate slaves who have been brought here under a misapprehension as my parents were many years ago. I arrived in Australia as an Irish migrant when I was fifteen years of age, but besides Australia I know no other country as my own. At the time when my parents migrated to Australia there were exhibited throughout the Old Country posters and pamphlets depicting Australia as a veritable garden of Eden, in which the pumpkins grew so large that it required a traction engine to take a single specimen in from the field, and where men had to mount ladders to cut down the sugar cane. The part of Victoria to which some of these migrants were attracted by such publicity methods was so barren that they had to displace their sheep with goats, and even the goats, which as honorable senators know can live where other animals starve, for they will eat almost anything, not even objecting to devouring a shirt, a pair of trousers, or a pair of " slacks," went blind looking for grass. The files containing the correspondence which has passed between the Commonwealth Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crutchley,</inline> the representative in Australia of the British Government, and the British Government itself, in relation to the repatriation of these settlers, must contain interesting reading. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> said that a number of returned soldier settlers had been the victims of sharp practices by persons connected with questionable land deals. </para>

                            <para>- Then I will say that various governments, including the Tas- manian Government, have been guilty of sharp practices in connexion with land transactions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> certainly did say that numbers of returned 'soldiers had been placed on land entirely unsuitable for cultivation. In the various Parliaments of Australia many hundreds of questions have been asked regarding the activities of " go-getters " and " land jobbers " in unloading unsuitable land on returned soldier settlers. In some of the States royal commissions have been appointed to inquire into various land deals. If only we could get at the truth of some of these transactions, a sordid story would be told. Politicians, and oven Ministers of the Crown, as well as private individuals, have been associated with land scandals of the first magnitude in Australia. This hill seeks to appropriate £100,000 in order to compensate those migrant settlers who, to-day, are practically starving through having been placed on unsuitable land. Yet, when £25,000 was asked for in order to grant relief to the unemployed at Christmas time, the Government said that money could not be found. The appropriation of this sum might he justified if it were paid to the unfortunate settlers, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> let the cat out of the bag when he stated clearly and definitely the channels into which the money would be diverted. He said that the "big stick" was being wielded over these unfortunate settlers, who were being intimidated. I realize that my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> and I, have no hope of success against the brutal majority of the Government. </para>

It is an extraordinary form of argument for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> to say that because the Government is not willing to give £100,000 to the unemployed at Christmas, as it ought to do, we should refuse to give £100,000 to deluded migrant farmers who are in need of it. I am at all times prepared to vote in favour of moneys being given to those who have been robbed by Australian Governments, and I am also in favour of voting sums of money to assist the unemployed; but the Government's refusal  to vote £100,000 for the unemployed is no reason for refusing to support this bill. </para>

                        <para>. - Let me clear up what appears to be a misapprehension in the minds of some honorable senators that this £100,000 is a grant. It is merely an appropriation, the destiny of which has to be determined by an arbitration decision by the Honorable Langer Owen. It may be that the decision will be that the legal responsibility rests with Victoria, in which event Victoria will reimburse the Commonwealth. I was glad of the logical way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> dealt with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn's</inline> argument. It is not logical to suggest that because we do not do something for somebody else, we should not pass this bill. This matter has formed the basis of considerable negotiation. The whole of the economic conditions of Australia have changed greatly since the majority of the men were settled on the land, and the crisis did not arise until after the fall in price levels. Whatever blame may be attached to those who induced these men to come from overseas, I do not think it can be said that they were at the time overoptimistic, having regard to the conditions then existing. It is fair to say that some of those who made the representations did so in the height of their enthusiasm, and regardless of the consequences. We are all liable at times to be perhaps a little too optimistic. </para>

                    <para>Dealing with the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> I can assure honorable senators that the possibility of the assigning of benefits that may accrue to settlers under this agreement has not been lost sight of. It formed the subject of discussion between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunstan,</inline> representing the Victorian Government, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham</inline> and myself, representing the Commonwealth Government. We found that we would have had to resort to devious and perhaps improper means to bring about an absolute exclusion of the power to assign. I raised the question myself, and we all realized the difficulties involved. It does not rest with us to supply the remedy, and it is not competent for either the Commonwealth or State Governments to interfere with the ordinary process of law if it is a matter of a garnishee. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> that his observations will be conveyed to the Attorney-General of Victoria, who is vary zealous to see that whatever benefits are provided shall go into the pockets of those who deserve them. Honorable senators will bear inmind that those who go off their blocks are relieved of personal liability, not only to the Crown, but also to the local authorities. But how can we interfere with the processes of the law if a man is in debt? I have had personal knowledge of the correspondence between the British representative in Australian and the Victorian Government, and Iknow that the cases in which anything of this kind could occur are very limited in number. I shall bring the matter which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has so properly raised, under the notice of the Victorian Government, because that Government actually deals with the settlers. It is through the assessors that the demand for the amount that we will have to find will come. I am quite sure that the Attorney-General of Victoria will see that nothing improper is done to garnishee or improperly secure this grant. </para>

                            <para>- We do not acknowledge any liability in respect to the matter. The Victorian Government adopts precisely the same attitude. In the meantime, as a <inline font-style="italic">modus</inline><inline font-style="italic">vivendi,</inline> we have made an agreement with the Government of Victoria to submit the issue to arbitration. The manner in which the money shall be distributed is provided for in Annexure K. We. do not actually approach the migrants themselves. That will be done by an assessor who will visit the various farms and arrive at a settlement as between the Closer Settlement Board of Victoria and the migrants. If the arbitrator fixes the responsibility for failure of the scheme on the Commonwealth, it will have to bear the cost. In the meantime the administration of the tentative agreement is in the hands of the Victorian Government. </para>

                        <para>- I am not raising this matter in any offensive spirit. I understand that the number of reporters on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff has been reduced by two, and that, under the new arrangement, four reporters are employed in this chamber and five in the House of Representatives. I nin not in favour of a reduction of any staff required to do expert work, for in any calling the placing of more work on the individual necessarily increases the risk of error and inefficiency. In several instances recently the reports of my speeches have been considerably condensed, which has resulted in a different meaning being given to the words I used. I believe that that is due to the fact that the staff has been reduced, and that additional work has been placed upon the shoulders of the reporters. I hope that the staff will not be unduly reduced, because in view of the attitude of newspapers in these days, <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is a valuable record of the proceedings in this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- It is, and I hope that nothing will be done to prevent the report from being as complete as practicable. I do not say that superfluities and tautology should be preserved, but a member's argument should be reproduced in the actual words used by him. Probably the reporter thinks that he can use more appropriate terms, but at times, the member who has made the speech prefers to see his own words in the report. He may think that the language he has used has a better literary flavour, or is more pungent, or that it expresses his ideas better than that of the reporter. Ari interjection which is made in clear tones should appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> otherwise its effect is lost. I do not say that frivolous remarks should bc recorded ; but when an honorable senator interjects. " That is not correct," or " I did not say that," his interjection should be recorded. </para>

I did not say anything so ridiculous. </para>

If the people of Australia knew the valuable work being carried out by the officers of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, they would willingly make available a much larger sum. A young country like Australia should give every assistance to those who engage in scientific investigation, for if this country is to compete successfully with other nations, it will have to make full use of scientific knowledge. I have my own opinion in regard to trade . competition and foreign trade; but so long as the present system of competition remains, Australia must endeavour to keep abreast of other nations in the methods of production and distribution.

                <para class="block">I do -not blame them for that. In my opinion, wo should keep for ourselves the best of what we produce, instead of shipping it overseas. A good deal of work has been done in Brisbane in connexion with the ' export of chilled beef. Experiments have been carried out, but £1,700 is too small a sum to conduct experiments with a view to making it possible to ship chilled beef to England. The supporters of the Ottawa agreement remind us that meat imports from the Argentine are reduced by from- 40,000 to 50,000 tons, representing between 150,000 and 250,000 cattle. If that be so, a new market opens up for Australian beef, if we can take advantage of it. A market for 40,000 or 50,000 tons of chilled beef is a matter of importance to the cattle-growers of Queensland. For many months we have been told that the scientists are on. the verge of a great discovery, and that soon Australians will be able to send chilled beef to the English market. Last August, the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> stated that a shipment of chilled beef from Queensland would be sent to the Old Country. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Vickery,</inline> who is conducting the experiments, has said the same thing on a number of occasions. We are now told that there is a possibility of a shipment of chilled beef being sent from the Brisbane abattoirs in February next. We have not yet achieved success in these experiments ; but success will come if sufficient support is given to the scientists connected with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Vickery,</inline> in the Journal of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, for November, 1933, tells us how far the experiments have progressed. On page 233 of the Journal, the following paragraph appears : - </para>

                    <para>For countries regularly engaged in a chilled beef trade with Great Britain, the duration of -the voyage seldom exceeds 25 days, but the corresponding time from Queensland, which contributes rather more than 85 per cent, of Australia's exports of quarters of beef, at present exceeds 50 days. Since about five days for the preparation of the beef in the meat works, and about three days for its marketing, must be added to this period, the average duration of holding of chilled beef exported from Queensland is likely to be of the order of 60 days. Only a small margin of safety exists in the export of chilled beef from countries nearer to Great Britain. It therefore seems fairly certain that, in order to secure reasonable freedom from wastage, a somewhat different technique from that used by Australia's competitors .must be employed in the export of chilled beef from the northern States of Australia. </para>

                <para class="block">It  is  not sufficient that beef may be held in a chilled condition for, 45 days. Under special conditions, which cannot be duplicated on ships, meat has been kept for 60 days in a chilled condition. I know that there have been private shipments of chilled beef, but none from the Brisbane abattoirs. Private shipments have not proved commercially profitable, because, although some of the beef was landed in good condition, much of it  was  affected by mould and bacteria. The prices obtained, however, have been good. The <inline font-style="italic">Mooltan</inline> shipment was sent on the 11th September, and was sold in the Smithfield market. Argentine beef realized 5£d. to 6-Jd. per lb., Australian chilled, 5d. to 5½d., and Australian frozen from 3£d. to 3-£d. Those prices show a difference of about 2d. per lb. in favour of chilled beef. If we could put chilled beef in proper condition on the English market, that advantage of 2d. a lb. would run into hundreds of thousands of pounds a year, and into millions in the course of years. Yet the Government is allowing only £1,700 for carrying on these investigations. Experiments with the De Raeve process have been conducted in Western Australia. A few days ago I asked that the papers relating to it should be laid on the table of the Senate. I was informed that Professor Young had spoken against the method, and that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which spoke through its mouthpiece, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> said that it was of no use conducting further experiments unless some fresh developments had occurred in this method of treatment. I have statements by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGhie,</inline> general manager of the  Wyndham  Meat Works, who said, " We have succeeded in holding chilled beef in good condition for one hundred days." Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Vickery</inline> says that 60 days is the limit with the carbon dioxide method under special conditions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGhie</inline> goes on to say - </para>

                    <para>I am confident that a longer period is possible, without deterioration, but we had to shut down then to close the season's operations. This is an important advance upon past practice. It demonstrates the possibility of holding chilled meat, not only long enough for shipment to London, but also to permit of deliveries there being regulated over periods to suit marketing requirements. When supplies of beef, of suitable description, become available for export, I believe it will be possible by this system to initiate a chilled beef trade from Australia. </para>

                        <para>- To use an unparliamentary expression, I am a "mug": I do not know. The total general expenses of the Australian Commissioner-General in the United States of America are given as £2,805. On another page I find an amount for the same gentleman of £2,274. This includes, " Special allowance to official secretary whilst acting as CommissionerGeneral, £500," and "Allowance to official secretary, £216." There is also an item covering the salary of the official secretary. I am not going to quibble about the salary paid to any man if he is doing his job. I am not an advocate of low wages, but I want to know about the expenses and allowances to the secretary. Do they go to support Al Capone's for boot-legged whisky, or any such things? I should like to know what benefit we are getting from the position of Australian Commissioner-General in the United States of America. Is the expenditure to enable the CommissionerGeneral to go to banquets and sing the " Star Spangled Banner " ? In view of the attitude of the United States of America on tariff matters, I fail to see that we are getting any benefits from our representation in that country. The whole of the expenditure should be discontinued. We are spending on the Commissioner-General about £3,000 a year that could be suitably expended in this country in building up an unemployment fund. We are getting very poor treatment from the United States of America in the matter of trade treaties, and we are " greasing the fat pig." </para>

                    <para>- Under division 16 provision is made for the appropriation of £41,000 to cover the cost of mail services to Papua, New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Norfolk Island, . Lord Howe Island and the New Hebrides. I understand' that provision is made in the contract for vessels carrying the mails to the islands mentioned to call at the British Solomons.

                    <para>[8.5]. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> has questioned the cost of conducting the High Commissioner' office in London. The estimated cost for 1933-34 exceeds the expenditure of 1932-33 by £1,302. This is accounted for by the fact that the estimated amount to be paid in salaries this year is £20,901, as compared with £19,775 paid last year, showing an increase of expenditure on this item of £1,126. The increase is made up by provision .having been made for six months' furlough to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> R. Collins, the ex-official secretary in the High Commissioner's office, who was retired from service on the 18th September, 1933; this has involved the expenditure of £826. An additional amount of £300 was also paid for extra duty pay. The general expenses last year were £27,449, as against the estimate of £27,025 for this year, or an increase of £176. Provision has been made for the transport expenses involved in the return of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins</inline> to Australia and the transport expenses of the exchange officer filling the position of assistant secretary. When these Estimates were prepared provision was made for the cost of the Min;ister without Portfolio, now the High Commissioner, returning to Australia. </para>

                <para>The Minister without Portfolio received while in London the amount which he would have received as High Commissioner and no more. The amount paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> included his ministerial salary and parliamentary allowance, the balance being made up from the High Commissioner's vote. Provision was made in this item to meet these payments for six months. Under item 10 an amount of £775 has been provided as an allowance to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> in accordance with the provision of the High Commissioner's Act, No. 22 of 1909, less reductions under the financial emergency legislation, namely, an allowance of £2,000 per annum, or £1,000 for six months, reduced to approximately £775. Salary will be paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> as High Commissioner under special appropriation. The foregoing amounts were included in the Estimates before the date of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce's</inline> appointment as High Commissioner. This shows that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> did not receive any more when acting as Minister without Portfolio than he would have received as High Commissioner. </para>
                <para>With respect to the point raised concerning the Pacific Island shipping service, I may explain that from the 9th November, 1931, Burns, Philp and Company agreed to reduce payments under the Pacific Islands contract for shipping mail services by 20 per cent., namely, from £55,000 to £44,000, for six months, and the reduced rate continues. The lower figure of £41,000 shown in the Estimates is due to payments from the British Government on account of the service provided under contract to the British Solomon Islands. </para>

                    GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia - Minister for Defence) [8.13].  -  The increase of expenditure in Australia's representation in the United States of America is £939. Honorable senators are. aware that officers employed in the Commissioner-General's office in the  United  States of America, and in the High Commissioner's office in London are Australians, and it has been the practice for many years past to arrange for them to return to Australia when other officers take their place. This is considered to be a desirable system, because it enables officers who have been stationed abroad to keep in close touch with Australian affairs. This year a relief officer is to fill the position of accountant in New York, and the amount provided for allowances associated with the transfer is £284. There are also removal expenses amounting to £600 to cover the expenses of two officers who are exchanging positions. The balance is accounted for by the partial restoration of reductions of salaries under the Financial Emergency Act.

                    <para>. - Under the heading, "Investigations," the sum of £113,414 is provided for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. That sum is reduced by £39,482, representing amounts recoverable by way of grants from outside sources. The proposed expenditure is approximately the same as for last year, but the grants are about £9,000 less. That is due in a large measure to the Empire Marketing Board having gone out of existence. These contributions from outside sources are made in respect of a number of matters. One man may be interested in food preservation, and may make a contribution to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to enable investigations to be conducted. The money so contributed is brought into the funds of the council, and the expenditure is audited by the Auditor-General. Another man may be interested in horticulture, or in animal health, and may make contributions to assist in the conduct of experiments. Were it not for these contributions from outside sources much of the valuable work performed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research could not be undertaken. </para>

                    referred to the export of chilled beef to England. The process of chilling beef has been the subject* of investigation by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Young,</inline>
                    a leading authority on the subject. If anything new can be brought under the notice of the council, it will be thoroughly investigated. The honorable senator desires the council to make rapid progress with this experiment. I remind him that the laboratory at Brisbane was opened only in July, 1932, although certain experiments had been made previously. When I inform the honorable senator that experiments have proved that chilled beef can be sent from Australia to England, he will realize that the Government has not been dilatory in this respect. Nor is it unmindful of the necessity for developing the chilled beef trade. It recognizes its indebtedness to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sunners</inline>
                    for his unsparing efforts in that direction. Only a little while ago, I received information from London that chilled beef from South Africa was finding a ready sale in London, whereas the stores there were full of frozen beef. We should do well if, instead of sending frozen beef to England, we sent chilled beef.

                        <para>- The Government realizes the importance of  the  Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to Australia, and makes available as much money as it can. In an address which I gave recently in Melbourne, I mentioned that the cost of  the  experiments conducted by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research amounted to about 2-Jd. per head of the population. The work which the council is doing is of tremendous value to this country. </para>

                    KINGSMILL  (Western Australia) [8.27]. - I should like some information in regard  to  fisheries research. I ask the Minister whether the fisheries conference is still in existence; if it is, what money is to be expended on it this year? I should also like to know what it has cost since its inception; and what work it has done. I understand that about £5,000 has been set down for fisheries research. That is a bitter disappointment to me. So far as I know, this subject came up for the second time in 1922-23, when, because of my personal interest  in  it, I wrote at considerable length to  the  Prime Minister of the day. Parliament then went into recess, and I heard no more about the matter until -one day after I had addressed the Senate in Melbourne, the Director of Development and Migration, who was in the audience, sought an interview with' me to discuss the matter. I readily agreed. When  he  saw me he asked me if I could draw up a scheme for him. I said I would. The scheme was not drawn up by one new to the subject, for I had already participated in two previous investigations in Western Australia. I was connected with them from their inception, including  the  fitting out of the trawlers and the practical trawling. From the first  investigation  we got a tremendous amount of information, principally about the dangers and losses likely  to  occur from trawling on the Western Australia coast. From the second  we got positive results, but .unfortunately the trawler was lost after the first day's trawling, although without loss of life. The results fortified the information' gained when one of the largest fishing grounds in the world was found in the Great Australian Bight. I drew up the set of. estimates for their latest developments. They were approved by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gepp,</inline>
                    now
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Herbert</inline>
                    Gepp, and it was thought that we ought to initiate the scheme. My scheme was somewhat more ambitious than that
                    <inline font-style="italic">on</inline>
                    the estimates. It was practical and could have been put into operation within six months.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gepp</inline>
                    thought it better to have a conference. I asked why. He said that it was necessary to implicate the States, and that State representatives ought to be at the conference. We had a conference of 29 people, of whom a large proportion were University professors. There were only two or three people with actual knowledge of trawling, which is the most important part of the investigation. A large number of subcommittees was appointed to inquire into various subjects, some relevant and some irrelevant. As far as I know this fisheries conference went on working. Being disgusted with the turn things had taken I resigned from it because I could not see that anything worth while would be achieved. Now we find that £5,000 is made available for only one . phase of fisheries research - a phase which, in my opinion, and in the opinion of many practical people, is less important than the prosecution of trawling experiments. It is a very pitiable result for the time and money that have been expended. I should like, if possible, to get a brief history of the fisheries conference.
                </para>
                <para>My scheme embraced the provision ultimately of four vessels, two for the eastern and western coasts, one to deal with the more important investigation of trawling, and the other to deal with pelagic fishing and drift netting. After taking an interest practically all my life in this matter it is disappointing to me to find that so little has been done for so much expenditure of time and money. I hope that some day we may come into line with other nations which find that these  inves- tigations  have paid them handsomely - such as the United States of America, the dominion of Canada, and the Mother Country. When I put my scheme forward we had plenty of knowledge of the subject, and plenty of money. Subcom.mitteees have been appointed and officers have been kept going at considerable ex- 'pense, and now we have no money. I am sorry that it should be so. I do not know whom to blame. Governments of two political colours have been in power and have honestly and sincerely expressed themselves as desirous of getting results. Parliament, I feel sure, would treat any project of the kind liberally. Other matters have intervened and this has been crowded out. The Government need not think that I want to make any proposal again. I have got rather tired of that because of the way I have been treated, but I think I have the right, as one who has taken a considerable and practical interest in this subject, to complain of the pitiable result of these years of inquiry and considerable expenditure of money. </para>

                        <para>- I do not mention this matter as a criticism of the Government, but it is a fact that the figures do not give us a clear idea of the actual amount of expenditure. There is no intimation in the bill that the expenditures are quoted in sterling. I submit that all figures; whether in the Estimates, the budget, or other financial statements, ought to be quoted in Australian currency. When honorable senators are debating the item of £48,000 for the High Commissioner's Office and expenses in London, they should add to it the ruling rate of exchange at £25 10s. per cent. The American expenditure is also quoted in sterling so to the £25 10s. per cent. must be added the difference between the sterling and the dollar rate. </para>

                    <para>. - I sympathize with SenatorKingsmill in his remarks about the fisheries conference. I opened the 1929 fisheries conference in Melbourne. Representatives of the Commonwealth and the States were present, and it was recommended that work in regard to the fisheries industry should be undertaken by the Commonwealth Government. Steps are now being taken which are designed to carry out that recommendation. The upshot was that a certain amount of work was done by some of the gentlemen who attended, and representations were made to the Commonwealth Government. In the course of time the work and expenditure of the fisheries conference became merged in the activities of the Development and Migration branch. </para>

About 60 per cent. of fishermen's catches are unloaded into the sea because the fish are not edible. A tremendous amount of support is offering and money is waiting to be put into the industry as soon as we can supply information about the habits of pelagic fish and can illustrate the most modern methods of catching them. Honorable senators who were in Canberra a week or two ago had an opportunity of seeing a film illustrating in a small way some of the iatest methods overseas. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> is right in saying that we are behind the times in this matter.

                    <para>During the years 1928-20, the writer had the privilege to be associated with the late Jean De Raeve in the carrying out of certain experiments and tests relating to the holding of beef in store in a chilled condition. By the application of this process 15 quarters of beef were held in storage at Wyndham in 1929 for a period of 99 days at a temperature of 30 degrees  Farenheit.  Judging by its appearance and condition at the time of its removal, one could readily believe that the meat could be held in this state almost indefinitely. </para>

                    <para>The dressed condition of the beef selected for the experiment would be termed " fiery " and lacking bloom, u condition brought about by the cattle not having been sufficiently rested before slaughter. No special dressing of any description was indulged in. The dressed quality of the beef would be termed " fair seconds ", several of the quarters showing superficial bruising. The balance of the quarters were released after 100 days had passed. The condition of these quarters was favorable and quite dry. Parcels of this meat were delivered to residents of ,the town and meat works, and all reports were favorable. I am quite confident that the period of holding chilled beef under this method is almost indefinite. </para>

                <para class="block">What is behind this refusal of the Government to obtain further information concerning the process? Are we to assume that, as in the case of the search for flow oil in Australia, American interests are operating to prevent the development of the new process? Is there any valid reason why the Government should decline to ask the Government of Western Australia for a report? It would not cost the Government anything like the amount involved in the answering of the plethora of questions which are  submitted  to Ministers from time to time. Actually, it would not cost more than, a 2d. stamp to obtain a report as to whether what I have been saying is correct. </para>

The new process is based on the scientific fact that foodstuffs of all description, when placed in storage, absorb oxygen, and give off carbon dioxide, and it is claimed for the De Raeve process that by passing nascent oxygen through the cooling chamber at a temperature higher than freezing point, and by the use of lime to take off the carbon dioxide, it is possible to keep meat, fruit, and foodstuffs of all descriptions for an indefinite length of time after they have been removed from the cooling chamber. </para>

                <para>This subject is of vital importance to Queensland, and, for that reason among others, I have been deeply interested in all developments in connexion with it. I realize that if we can improve the general condition of Queensland and the other States, we shall also be able to improve the general condition of the working classes. If the Government decides to carry out experiments, it is only right that those who consider that the De Raeve process is the better, should have an opportunity to witness the tests by the new process. In these days, when it is essential to take advantage of every forward stop in the development of scientific methods for the treatment of our export products, the Government would be fully justified in expending a few thousands of pounds in this direction, because, if the new process proved successful, its adoption would enable Australian exporters of beef and mutton to compete on even terms with the Argentine. </para>

                    <para>[8.53]. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> mentioned the subject of exchange in relation to the cost of Australian representation in London and New York. I direct his attention to the item under Division 102 - Exchange on remittances to London and New York, £692,000. The cost of exchange last year was £713,537. The provision for exchange this year is £21,537 less than was expended, and £175,000 less than was voted for the financial year 1932-33. The drop in the estimated requirements is due to the reduced cost of remitting to New York moneys due for interest and other commitments, consequent on the fall of the value of the dollar in terms of sterling. Further provision is made elsewhere in these Estimates for exchange in respect of war services payable out of revenue, Commonwealth railways and the departments of Defence and the Postmaster-General. </para>

It is one of' the largest fishing-grounds in the world, and, I believe, one of the richest. The existence of this source of wealth is known, but the existence of pelagic, freeswimming fish is merely suspected, and I think that we should not drop the substance for the shadow. The experiments made regarding pelagic fish have been small in extent, and inconclusive in result. Therefore, the prosecution of trawling experiments is much more important, at the present time, to Australia, and to the fishing population of this country than the pursuit of what may  prove to be a shadow. I do not utter a complaint so much as express my regret that more money has not been provided for this work, and that more attention has not been given to it by the Government. Trawling operations, if carried out on an extensive scale, might contribute greatly to the prosperity of the Commonwealth. In view of the improvements made in methods of preserving fresh foodstuffs, I share with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> his anxiety that these experiments should be vigorously prosecuted. This is a matter of applied science, not pure science. One of the first things that the Fisheries Conference endeavoured to do, at the instance of the university men who attended it in large numbers, was to separate pure science from the icthyological  stations in various parts of Australia. The investigation of this matter is a problem which belongs, not to applied science, but to the pure science universities of Australia. It has always been carried out by them in other parts of the world. I again ask that the important subject of fisheries should receive attention, no matter what particular government happens to be in power, because everybody in. the community is interested in it. For many years Labour governments have been just as keen as have Nationalist governments to have scientific investigations- carried out, and they have done much, more than the Nationalist governments to promote, for instance, afforestation. </para>

                        <para>-That is not true -of Western Australia or' New South . Wales ; possibly it applies to Victoria and Tasmania. No matter what, government- may be in power, there is no political, obstacle to prevent it from taking greater interest than has been shown- in  the past   in this most im portant subject. The discovery of new processes for preserving foods practically annihilates distance because the speedy vessels now used make it possible for Great <inline font-style="italic">^Britain to get</inline> fish from Iceland in the north to well down the coast of Africa in the south. Why should Australia not try to emulate that example? We are expending money on much less desirable objects. I promise the Vice-President of the Executive Council that if he will promise that he will help in this matter, I shall not bother him further. During the time I have been in this Parliament, I have drawn attention to the importance of forestry and fisheries development on many occasions, and I am afraid that honorable senators will regard me as a sort of monomaniac. I am prepared to support any government, irrespective of its political colour, that will pay attention to these two subjects, which are of the utmost importance to Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - The practice of detailing the expenditure of the High Commissioner's office in terms of sterling leads to a false impression of the expenses actually incurred. This is particularly noticeable in the Estimates, which are given to honorable senators for the purposes of comparison, because all other estimates are shown in Australian currency. There is nothing on the page on which the expenditure of the High Commissioner's office is detailed to indicate that the figures given are in sterling, and, necessarily, in the absence of an explanation, the figures would be accepted as representing Australian currency. 'It seems to me that this practice is' definitely wrong. Who can say that, when stable financial conditions have returned, the Australian pound will not be devalued as the American dollar has been? </para>

Has the Council for Scientific "and Industrial Research given attention to the two oldest exporting industries in Australia? I refer to the sandalwood and the sealing industries. The former was established 123 years ago, and has been exporting its product to China ever since. The sealing industry is almost as old as the sandalwood industry, and both are likely to disappear unless attention is given to them. The sandalwood industry is conducted both in Western Australia and Queensland. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been unable to find any vote for one of the chief industries in the Pacific possessions of the Commonwealth. I do not wish to assume the role of a prophet.; but I submit for the consideration of the Government that it will meet with serious trouble if money is not set aside for the help of the copra industry. Whale oil has been found satisfactory for the manufacture of margarine, and the planters in Papua, the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, and adjacent islands, fear that their industry is threatened with disaster. Further research should be made to discover new uses of copra and its oil. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> is temporarily absent from the chamber because he would support my suggestion that greater activity should be displayed by the Council for Scientific andIndustrial Research in suggesting means by which the smaller fish caught in Australian waters could be utilized, particularly by canning. When in Western Australia I devoted some time in endeavouring to catch fish from the Busselton pier, but the only varieties I saw there were yabbies, mussels, blue-eyed sharks and blonde mermaids. Residents on the gold-fields would appreciate a regular supply of fresh fish, but the only means they have of obtaining supplies is through the 450 miles of pipe line which supplies Kalgoorlie with water. Although thousands of tons of edible fish are to be found in the waters off the New South Wales coast, no attempt seems to be made to utilize them. Hundreds of artisans in Balmain, where I was reared, are capable of building trawlers if given the opportunity! In New Guinea waters there are thousands of tons of small fish suitable for canning, and with the assistance of trawlers they could readily be netted. I understand that it costs the New South Wales authorities 14s 9d. a week to regulate the temperature of the water in the shark tank at the Taronga Park Zoo. </para>

                        <para>- That makes the position even worse. Although an adequate supply of edible fish is available, there are serious deficiencies in the handling methods, particularly with respect to curing. Ample supplies are available in Western Australia, and many of the varieties could be cured if the Government would render some assistance. At Dongara, a small port north of Perth, two men commenced curing fish, and while engaged in the business their product was pronounced to be superior to the New Zealand blue cod. Unfortunately they did not receive any encouragement and eventually went out of business. If the Commonwealth or State authorities subsidized men who embarked upon this class of business, it  would eventually become an important Australian industry. </para>

It is true that under the Ottawa agreement our market has been  someAvhat  restricted, but I do not suppose the present export restrictions  will  continue indefinitely: The Queensland people are intensely interested in the export of meat, particularly beef, and are anxiously awaiting the discovery of a satisfactory chilling process. If the De Raeve process mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> should prove successful, it would receive the support of the Queensland people on whose behalf he spoke. A thorough trial should be made as early as possible. The Government is, of course, conducting tests on its own behalf, but the matter is so important thatany private or semi- private effort should be encouraged. I h ope that the Government will obtain a report as  speedily  as possible, and that any suitable recommendations made will be promptly adopted. The cost of such investigations should not trouble the Government, because the discovery of a suitable chilling process will mean millions of pounds to Australia. </para>

                <para>Reference has been made to the utilization of the large quantities of edible fish to be found in Australian waters. It is scandalous that such large quantities of imported fish are consumed in Australia. Two Queensland companies have had their representatives in Canberra giving members all information with a view to placing the business on a' commercial  basis.  I was pleased to learn earlier in the session that the Government proposes to purchase or build a trawler to engage in research work in an endeavour to deter mine the best source of supplies. In the warmer waters of Queensland, large quantities of small fish suitable for canning are available. I was glad to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and others urging that the desirability of Australia supplying its own fish requirements should be kept to the fore. </para>
                <para>Reports issued by the Public Service Board from time to time have stated that the discontinuance of recruiting during recent years is likely to have a serious effect on the Public Service by causing a shortage of trained officers. In the Public Service there are a number of positions for which only highly-trained men are suitable. The position is already serious, and, in the opinion of those competent to judge, it will become more so as the years pass. I am informed that, unless the Government takes action to ensure a regular supply of highly-trained officers for the Public Service, the position will be desperate in about fifteen years' time. </para>

                <para class="block">I do so to draw attention to the necessity for a different policy in connexion with invalid and old-age pensions. Under division  19,  salaries and allowances are set down at  £53,461,  and payments to temporary and casual employees at  £5,256.  Other payments to officers bring the total to  £59,321.  Under the heading " General Expenses,"  £5,000  is set down to meet the cost of medical examinations. Many applicants for pensions get a raw deal from the medical referees appointed by the Government. Cases have come under my notice of aged and invalid persons who have paid several guineas to a Macquarie-street specialist, and have been told that they are eligible for pensions, only to find later that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ludowici,</inline> the departmental medical referee, reported otherwise, I should like to know how much of the  £5,000  set down for medical examination is paid to each of the depart- mental doctors, and whether they are paid a flat rate, or according to the number of cases with which they deal. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ludowici,</inline> who is a keen member of the New Guard, attempts to bully applicants for pensions. If my dear old f ather were to be treated by him as some of the pioneers of this country have been treated, I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ludowici</inline> would' not get off lightly. I am prepared to give to the Minister specific instances of the bullying methods of this man. He may think that, because he obtained a university diploma which enables him to style himself a doctor, he can claim to have put out the big fire in China. So long as I  remain  a member of the Senate I shall endeavour to obtain fair treatment for the workers, whether they belong to the black-coated brigade or are classed as navvies. No medical referee has any right to bully an unfortunate applicant for a pension, who perhaps assisted to build up the country and to make it possible for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ludowici</inline> and other referees to obtain big fees. The only crime of the old people is that they are white-haired. </para>
                <para>The present so-called National Government, which sends its representatives to Geneva to attend the  meetings of the League of Nations, has set up in business as a glorified estate agent, and is "scabbing " on the estate agents throughout the Commonwealth. By an act of constitutional burglary the Government seeks to take away the shack of the old people after they nave gone to their long rest, irrespective  of the claims of their sons and daughters to the old home. Surely the children of Australia's pioneers should not be penalized for keeping a roof over the heads of their parents. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> promised that the sections of the act relating to the confiscation of a pensioner's property would be repealed before Christmas ; but already both Houses of Parliament are rushing legislation through in the hurry to get into recess. Were it not that my language would be regarded as unparliamentary, I should say that the Government adopts mass organization methods, and resorts to acts of political brutality in order to get its legislation through Parliament. Many applicants for pensions have been given a rough spin by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ludowici.</inline> He is not going to be allowed to employ any of the Fascisti methods with applicants for old-age pensions. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator never mentioned invalid pensioners. He ought to know  - and  if  he  does not know, he is not fit to be a senator - that no doctor has anything to do with old-age pensioners. Yet he, in  thi3  chamber, vilified a medical man for no other apparent reason than that he happens to have as a friend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eric</inline> Campbell, chief of the New Guard. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> ought to be ashamed of such a speech. He has made statements showing that he is entirely ignorant of the administration of the Old-age Pensions Department, and of what applicants for pensions are required to do. He knows now that he failed badly  in his  attempt  to  injure a medical man. A senator, by virtue of his position, ought, at all events, to behave as a gentleman. </para>

                    LAWSON (Victoria - Assistant Treasurer)  [9.50]. -  The Prime Minister made a promise regarding the amendment of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. Notice of a bill has been given in another place, and I can give an assurance that the measure will reach this chamber before wo adjourn for the Christmas vacation, and that there will be the fullest opportunity provided to discuss every aspect of the charges that have been made, and the clauses that are objected to. I, therefore, suggest that honorable senators should refrain from anticipating the debate on that bill.
                </para>
                <para>Regarding the administration of the  old-age pensions law, the Government is not concerned with the political opinions of its officers. All men should enjoy the full freedom of citizenship, and the Government would not oppress or condemn an officer because of the political opinions he might hold. It does not seem proper to take the opportunity provided by a debate in the Senate to discuss the association of a medical referee with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eric</inline> Campbell, or any one else, in promulgating certain political views. The honorable senator knows that there are degrees of propriety, and conventions that ought to be observed by senators in attacks on public servants who are not here to reply for themselves. "We have .great privileges, but they carry corresponding responsibilities, and the surest way of taking from representative institutions the confidence and respect of the people is for honorable senators to abuse their position of privilege in this chamber, by making unfounded attacks, based perhaps on the political opinions or associations of the persons they are attacking. "We are concerned with the administration of the department. The policy of the Government is not to concern itself with the political opinions of medical referees. In the administration, and also in the inquiries by magistrates, it endeavours, tq see that applicants for old-age pensions, who are probably not well educated, and not accustomed to judicial surroundings, are treated with the utmost courtesy and .consideration. I have myself had a good deal of experience with pension applicants, and I have not heard from any of them charges of inconsiderate treatment by public servants or magistrates. On the contrary, I have met people who have been before magistrates,, and have spoken highly of the courtesy, kindliness and understanding extended to them. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking from the limited experience I have had in the districts I know well. Inquiries by officers in those districts are characterized by kindness, tolerance, courtesy, and consideration, and I have no reason to doubt that that is the general attitude. It is the policy for which the Government stands. The Government tries to remember the class of persons with whom it is dealing, and to give them a full measure of consideration. If the honorable senator will make specific charges - and I do not suggest that he should make them on the floor of the Senate - they will be carefully investigated. I suggest to him that these .matters can best be dealt with administratively, by reference to the Minister concerned. That method is more effective, less expensive to the country, and more economical of time than the bringing forward of such matters in the Senate. If honorable senators will employ that method, they will get better 'results, and will be doing nothing to detract from the confidence and respect in which the Senate should be held by the people. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> not to persist in his present method of attack. These Estimates cover merely administrative machinery, cost of administration, and so on. If there are complaints against the administration, they can be more properly made on the amending bill which is to be introduced later. Honorable senators' rights will not be taken away by adopting my suggestion. The fullest opportunity for discussion will be given when the legislation, is introduced, and I promise that it will be introduced before Christmas. </para>

If the honorable gentleman will take the responsibility of making specific charges, the Minister will, in accordance with the regular practice of governments, order an investigation. A specific charge will call for a detailed reply. This, I suggest, is the method which the honorable senator should adopt if he has any definite complaints to make against  the  doctor mentioned.

                    <para>. -  I should not have taken part inthis debate if the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Lawson)</inline> had not delivered a lecture to my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dunn)</inline> as to the proper method of presenting his case. I have no personal knowledge of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ludowici,</inline> but I have heard, in a general way, charges of the nature mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn.</inline> I agree that the proper course, if an inquiry is desired, is to make a specific charge. Whenever I have had complaints to inquire into, I have interviewed the Minister in charge of the department concerned, and have ventilated them with the full intention that, if I did not get satisfaction, I would mention them on the floor of Parliament. I have one or two which I will mention in this way very shortly. As I have said, there have been general complaints against <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ludowici.</inline> One of the defects of human nature is that certain persons in authority treat with more orless contempt those who are socially beneath them, and are, to some extent, at their mercy. Some  aTe  extremely arrogant and unpleasant in their dealings with the poor, while others go to the other extreme and are very careless. Perhaps I can better explain what I mean by citing my own experience. I have never had the bad luck to require an invalid pension, but many years ago, when I was working for the Sydney City Council, I was injured as the result of an accident, and had to report my condition in order to receive compensation. I was then told that I must first see my private doctor. As I had not had an illness for about 40 years, I did not have a private doctor, so I had to find one, and, incidentally, fee him. He ordered me to pull off my coat, and then, without any further preliminaries, merely felt my shoulders to determine the nature of the injury. I then reported to the City Council doctor, to whom I presented the certificate issued to me by my private doctor. The City Council doctor then instructed me to go to the insurance company for examination by its doctor. When I saw this gentleman he said to me, "Have you seen the city doctor?" I replied that I had, and he said, " Oh that will be all right". Thus I was obliged to go through the farce of being examined by three separate doctors, not one of whom really took the trouble to examine me at all. What I have said illustrates my statement that, in many instances, medical' men carry out their duties in the most perfunctorymanner. Others, it is well known,  are  as disagreeable as they can possibly  be  to those who happen to be in the humble position of pensioners, and treat them as dirt beneath their feet. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> knows more than I do about the complaints which have reached him.[Quorum <inline font-style="italic">formed.]</inline> Those unfortunate people whose economic position is such as to force them to make application for the invalid or old-age pension should be treated decently and with respect, because most of them are just as good as other people in more prosperous circumstances. I am satisfied that we shall have an opportunity to deal with all these matters in another measure that will come before the Senate shortly, and as the Minister has given us an assurance that, if specific charges are levelled against <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ludowici,</inline> inquiries will be made. I think my colleague should, in the circumstances, withdraw his motion. </para>

                    <para>. - I direct attention to the delay that takes place in connexion with bankruptcy proceedings. The position was bad enough before the passing of the federal law relating to bankruptcy, but it is infinitely worse now. Surely it should be possible to speed up the proceedings. As there is an increase of the vote this year, I hope all proceedings in bankruptcy will  be expedited. Most business people wipe off debts rather than seek redress through the Federal Bankruptcy Administration, as they know that the costs incurred will wipe out any collections made. </para>

                    last week referred to the settlements at Molonglo and Causeway, and I brought his remarks under the notice of the Minister for the Interior, who has furnished the following reply : -
                </para>
                <para>The tenements at Causeway were erected for the temporary accommodation of workmen engaged in the early construction of Canberra. At that time it was the intention to demolish the settlement immediately construction work finished, but up to the present it has not been found possible to accommodate the tenants of these houses elsewhere. This settlement has, therefore, been allowed to remain and there is every indication that it will be necessary to retain it for some years to come. </para>
                <para>The Government is anxious to demolish certain tenements at the earliest possible moment, but it does not admit that the housing provided at the Causeway can be described as slum conditions, or that the occupants of these houses suffer any indignity or endanger their health by residence in the settlement. In fact -the Causeway houses are keenly sought after by intermittent workers and others of moderate means, so much so thatmany tenants of cottages in Canberra have voluntarily transferred to the Causeway and have subsequently expressed their satisfaction with the. conditions prevailing in that settlement. </para>
                <para>The cottages at Causeway are in a very fair state of repair. All the houses were painted two years ago, and work on interior renovations is being commenced this week. Moreover, approval has recently been given for the provision of additional rooms in 26 of the houses where the size of the families justified such additional accommodation. Arrangements have also been made to plant the area surrounding the settlement with a belt of trees for the beautification of the area and to afford much needed protection against the weather. </para>
                <para>It is probable that the Causeway settlement will be required for the housing of workmen until such time as the transfer of the remaining departments to Canberra has been completed. It will then be possible to formulate a scheme for the provision of permanent homes for all workmen required for the maintenance of Government services in Canberra. </para>
                <para>It is the policy of the Government, therefore, to continue to maintain the cottages at Causeway in a habitable condition, and in their present state of repair, and to transfer occupants of other tenements to this settlement whenever vacancies occur. </para>
                <para class="block">I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> admitted that the conditions at the Causeway are better than those at Molonglo. The Minister's reply continues - </para>
                <para>The tenements at Molonglo are situated about 5 miles from the centre of the city, and were originally erected as a concentration camp during the war period. They were subsequently reconstructed to provide temporary accommodation for workmen, and were never intended to be the permanent homes of residents. The Government is anxious to demolish these buildings, but the demand for accommodation of this type is so keen, and the housing shortage so acute, following on the cessation of construction work during the depression, that it has been loath to authorize the demolition of any building which might offer even temporary shelter to a family in necessitous circumstances. </para>
                <para>The Molonglo tenements are served with electric light and sewerage, are connected with the Canberra  water supply, and are maintained in a habitable condition by the department. The health inspector periodically inspects the tenements, and any complaints brought under notice by that officer are given immediate attention. </para>
                <para>Approval has been given for the supply of paint to the majority of the tenants at Molonglo for the purpose of brightening up their homes for Christmas, and the honorable senator has been misinformed in this connexion. </para>
                <para>At present there are 89 tenants at Molonglo, and 23 applications are held from persons desirous of obtaining a house in the settlement. It will, therefore, be seen that it would be necessary to construct over 100 new workmen's cottages in Canberra before the demolition of the houses at Molonglo could be effected. Provision has been made on the current year's Estimates for the erection of 32 workmen's homes, and this will meet the present shortage of houses of this type. "When these houses are completed, a number of tenants from Causeway, who are in regular employment, will be transferred thereto, and vacancies thus occurring at Causeway will be filled by the transfer of tenants from Molonglo. By a continuation of this policy, it is hoped gradually to demolish the Molonglo settlement. </para>
                <para>The general question of providing accommodation for workmen in Canberra is to some extent involved by reason of the fact that a great many tenants are unemployed or receive only intermittent work. </para>
                <para>The amount of arrears of rent due in connexion with the Causeway settlement is £4,533, owing by 92 tenants, and the number in arrears at Molonglo is 71, who are in arrears to the extent of £2,607. </para>

                    <para>By interrogation, it was elicited in the House of Representatives on Tuesday that the total expenditure on the Federal Capital Territory, including national buildings, is now £13,627,317; the total receipts to June 30th last, £1,673,220. Therefore, the loss is £11,954,097, a huge sum which has been wrung from the people of Australia who produce the national income. Canberra produces nothing but politicians. </para>

                <para class="block">I disagree with the statement that Canberra produces nothing but politicians. It is true that they come to Canberra; but this city produces and sustains only public servants. A huge amount of money has been wrung from the Australian taxpayers in order to construct this artificial city, and, as the article states, most of the money has been wasted. The report continues - </para>

                <para class="block">That is correct, so far as I know. Wherever we look we can see the result of useless expenditure incurred in Canberra, and in many respects the article is true. In travelling around Canberra one can see miles and miles of unnecessary streets and footpaths and also extensive gardens provided for the residents of Canberra, but paid for by the Government. Heavy expenditure has also been incurred on sewerage and water supply systems, but those works are not visible. Had Canberra been designed with its suburbs more closely situated, residents would have been better served and unnecessary expenditure would have been avoided. This city should have been designed and built on lines somewhat similar to other capital cities which are more convenient from every view-point. I believe in town planning, but not on the lines adopted in Canberra, which is most inconvenient, particularly in the matter of transport. The article further states that - </para>

                <para class="block">That is substantially accurate. There is one reference to Canberra which is wrong and which, of course, was noticed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn,</inline> who apparently peruses every issue of this newspaper. The statement to which I refer, is that some members of this Parliament owe to the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms £17,000. In all other respects the language used by this estimable family journal is accurate and justified. </para>

I have since had the opportunity to peruse the statement, and desire to offer one or two comments upon it and to make some suggestions. The Minister said that I was misinformed concerning the applications made by some of the tenants for paint, to enable them to brighten up their homes before Christmas, because such applications have been granted. I am not in a position to say that the Minister's statement is inaccurate, but when I visited those settlements I was informed by one lady tenant that her' husband's application for paint to renovate the place so that it would look presentable at Christmas time had been refused. Obviously both statements cannot be correct. I regret that the Minister is satisfied with the statement he made on behalf of the Government with respect to these two settlements. </para>

                        <para>- The reason why the Causeway cottages need a windbreak is that they are so rottenly built that they cannot withstand the weather. I have seen these buildings, and know how impossible it is to keep the wet and cold out of them. Women and children are living in unhealthy dwellings while the  trees which will form a windbreak are growing. In some of these dwellings newspapers have to be stuffed into the cracks and openings to make them habitable. - The department admits that 100 workmen's cottages are required in Canberra. Why does it not go ahead and build them? It is useless to say that money for the purpose cannot be found. If war broke out to-morrow, money would be found within 24 hours for the purpose of destruction. It would then be a matter not of a few thousands of pounds but of millions of pounds, and no one would be permitted to complain. Since I spoke on this matter a few days ago, a medical man came to me and volunteered to give me further information regarding the danger to the health of the community from the unhealthy conditions existing in these settlements. I approached four doctors, and obtained written information from three of them, and the fourth very kindly gave me the opportunity to see things for myself. In the face of evidence from four doctors that these settlements are a source of danger to the health of the community, I am expected to remain quiet merely because provision is made in these Estimates for 32 workmen's cottages. The departmental statement which seeks to cloud the issue concludes with a number of uncalled for statements regarding the rent owing by some of the tenants of these cottages. The non-payment of rent is no excuse for the Government's inaction. If I were a tenant of one of these cottages, I would not pay any rent for such miserable shelter. I shall lose no opportunity to urge that something be done in regard to these settlements. I do not want less beauty or less town planning in Canberra; I do want these unsatisfactory habitations removed as early as possible. </para>

The former do not pay State income tax, State unemployment tax, or any hospital tax; and, apparently, as compensation for that relief from taxation, they are given a special allowance for living in Canberra. A federal public servant living in Western Australia pays State income tax, a tax for the relief of unemployment, on a graduated scale running as high as 9d. in the £1, and a -special hospital tax of 4½d. in the £1. </para>

For the rent of buildings, £45,363 was voted last year, and £45,588 paid. The estimated expenditure this year is £46,710.

                    PEARCE (Western Australia - Minister for Defence) [10.59]. - During the last financial year, considerable savings were effected in rents payable by the Government, by reason of departments in Melbourne having 'been transferred to buildings owned by the Commonwealth. These savings wore offset by increased rentals in Sydney, where certain departments, notably the taxation branch of the Treasury, were transferred from their old location to the Commonwealth Bank building, which offered more suitable accommodation, and was more centrally situated. The liabilities in respect of rents payable in the various States and territories amount to £48,191 ; but the proposed appropriation of £46,710, although smaller, should be sufficient to meet the expenditure during the year, after allowing for further anticipated savings. The increased cost compared with last year is due to the expansion of the taxation branch of the Treasury, to cope with sales tax and other legislation. Apart from that, there has been a saving. The whole of the additional expenditure has been incurred in Sydney.

This is the principal item of expenditure under the division, and provides for the payment to the State Government of Victoria of the sum of £5,277 that being the annual amount agreed upon as compensation for the surrender of the unexpired portion of the ten years' lease of the building. The total amount of compensation involved is £42,865, and payment at the rate of £5,277 per annum will be made until the agreement expires on the 31st December, .1938.

                <para>That brings me to another matter which vitally concerns the Department of the Interior, and should be borne in mind by honorable senators who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> object to the good times enjoyed by public servants who live in Canberra. For the life of me I cannot see why we should object to people allegedly having a good time. We should, on the contrary, see that increasing numbers of them have a good time. People who live in Canberra have no vote. They  cannot make their ' political power felt. To the extent to which they escape taxation they have no representation. They contribute a relatively small amount to the hospital, but there also they have no representation. It is time we stopped talking of the wonderful opportunities public servants have, because they happen to live in Canberra. They certainly have delightful surroundings, but they should be given every advantage we can afford to give them. The time is fast coming, when we must consider the granting to thom of full political, municipal, and other rights. </para>

                    <para>. - Under the division - Governor-General's Establishment - there is an item "Fuel, light and power, £1,000." Seeing that  His Excellency  the Governor-General and Lady Isaacs are often away from Yarralumla, £1,000 seems an extraordinary amount for fuel, light and power. </para>

                <para>Even if public servants in Canberra are a little favoured, J am pleased to know that some people in these hard times get some advantage. We do not want to see every one on or below the bread line.
