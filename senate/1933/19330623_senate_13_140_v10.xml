Was the Government advised of the proposed restriction by cable or wireless telephone from London? Has notMr. Bruce been in touch with the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Latham) in Melbourne and Canberra? </para>

            <para class="block">The <inline font-weight="bold">PRESIDENT (Senator the Hon. P. J. Lynch).</inline> - It will be remembered that on Thursdaylast certain questions were asked by some honorable senators respecting the report of the Public Service Board on the working of the parliamentary staffs, and it was suggested by those questions that something had been done by the governing authority of Parliament in excess of its power, or, at least, without warrant. I explained at the time that the authorities administering the departments of the Parliament are the  Speaker  and myself, and to show where and how we derive our powers, I direct the attention of honorable senators to section 9 of the Public Service Act 1922-1924, sub-section 3, in which the following words appear : - </para>
            <quote>
                <para>Any reference in this act or the regulations thereunder to the Minister shall so far as the departments of the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Parliamentary Library, the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, and the Joint House Department are concerned, be read as a reference to the  President  or the  Speaker  or the  President  and the  Speaker  (as the case may be). </para>
            </quote>
            <para class="block">That section puts <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself, either individually or jointly, in relation to the departments of the Parliament in the same position as a Minister of the Crown is in relation to the administrative departments. The definition of Minister given in the act is : -  " The Minister " means the responsible Minister of the Crown for the time being administering the department in which is employed or proposed to be employed the officer or person in connexion with whom the term is used or is applicable. </para>
            <para class="block">Then, again, section 9, sub-section 2, of the Public Service Act enacts that - </para>
            <quote>
                <para>Subject to this section, unless inconsistent with the context, any action or approval re- - quired by this act or the regulations thereunder to be taken or given by the board may, so far as officers of the Parliament are concerned, be taken or given by the  President  or the  Speaker  or the  President  and the  Speaker  (as the case may be) in substitution for the board. </para>
            </quote>
            <para class="block">I remind those honorable senators who hold the opinion that something has been done by the  Speaker  and myself which cannot be justified, to cast back their minds to a time when the authority and privileges of Parliament were not so securely founded - so impregnable - as they are in these days. The time was when Parliament, as a branch of the Government of the country, had to make a long, fierce, and courageous struggle to obtain the recognition of the liberty of speech, the privileges, and the authority, which it ultimately gained and now possesses. This Parliament enjoy to-day the rights which were gained for all British parliaments by the Parliament of Great Britain. In those days an autocrat was needed to maintain the authority and supremacy of Parliament which are to-day freely recognized. </para>
            <para>As to the report of the Public Service Board, and the why and the wherefore of it, honorable senators will recollect that three years ago the financial position of this country suddenly became most grave, affecting not only the citizens of this country individually, but also its governments, both those of  the  six State Governments and the Commonwealth Government. Calamity descended upon this country almost in a night, and occasion at once arose to search for means whereby both public and private finance could be put into better order. The Commonwealth Government therefore made a request to the presiding officers of the Parliament to ascertain whether some saving could not be effected in the administration of the departments of the Parliament in keeping with the economies that were being made in every other department under the control of the Government. My predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> after consultation, and some unwillingness, I presume, on the part of both of them, decided to ask the Public Service Commissioner to appoint officers to inquire into the organization of the "departments of the Parliament. There are five departments of Parliament, and their total expenditure amounts to something like  £60,000. I  may say that had I then been  President  of the Senate, I believe that I would have acted as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> did, although I realize how - dangerous and unprecedented it is to permit an outside body to inquire into the exercise by Parliament, or by those appointed to give effect to the authority of Parliament, of the time honoured, traditional and exclusive powers of this august body. But the conditions then prevailing made it incumbent upon the presiding officers to give that authority, because the request of the Government could not be interpreted as an .attempt ' on the part of the Crown to encroach upon the preserves of Parliament. The administration in power is charged with the responsibility of levying and raising taxes from the people, and, in the last analysis, is the governing authority of this country. If it did not insist upon the money raised by taxation from the savings of the people being well and wisely expended, it would, quickly, be brought to book for its disregard of the interests of the  taxpayers.  On a question such as this, therefore, the Parliament could not insist upon the rigid control of its own powers, regardless altogether of the opinion of the Government of the day. Times have changed since the struggles between the Crown and Parliament, and as the government of the country is charged exclusively with the management of its financial affairs, and has the power of the purse, it has also control of parliamentary finance. For instance, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> or myself asked for something unreasonable, the Government must have power to refuse it, particularly if the request involved parliamentary expenditure which could not be justified. The controlling authority which, in this case, is the Government, in exercising its powers, must also accept the responsibility for its action. There is in the Public Service Act a provision which gives this Parliament power to seek advice from an outside body. That power is contained in sub-section 5 of section 9, which reads - </para>
            <quote>
                <para>Provided that if the  President  or the  Speaker,  or the  President  and the  Speaker  (as the case may be), by writing addressed to the  Chairman  of the Board, requests the board to classify any officers and offices of the Parliament, the board shall classify those officers and offices in the manner provided in this act. </para>
            </quote>
            <para class="block">It is quite clear from that provision that the presiding officers of the Parliament may, if they think fit, invite an outside authority to enter the domain of the Parliament, and make recommendations and classifications as they please. </para>
            <para>The report that has been obtained is confidential in its nature. It was not obtained in a public way, by the calling of witnesses, their examination on oath, and the publication of their evidence. It is one of that class of reports which are commonly made to the Government or to a Minister, and being confidential, I do not propose to make it public. There  are many reasons for treating such a report in that way. In this instance the officer who investigated the working of the departments of the Parliament, and made close inquiries into the management of the departmental heads and the work of the subordinate  officials,  had to place on record opinions, the publication of which might be unfair to those concerned, as well as to that officer whose business it was to criticize their work. Besides, where opinions differ widely, it is only fair that both sides should be heard. If such a report were made public the value of all such future reports would be destroyed, because no officer would place on record unfavorable opinions that he knew would be blazoned to the world outside. Further, there is precedent for this keeping of the report private. Only the other day questions were asked about the appointment of an officer to a position in London, and it was clearly stated by the Leader of the Government that he could not make public the confidential reports on that officer's character and qualifications, because to do so would not be in the interests of public efficiency or in the best interests of the State itself. This report is one of many the confidential nature of which makes it undesirable that their contents should be made public. There are some good suggestions in the report, and some not so good. Effect has been given to some of them; but with regard to others there is a fierce conflict of opinion. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pinner</inline> did his work thoroughly; he presented a report of 160 type-written pages, which left nothing untouched. But a person who sets out on such an undertaking requires a knowledge of parliamentary procedure, and -of the parliamentary system, before he can furnish a report of value. As I have said, some of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pinner's</inline> recommendations have already been acted on; others it is not proposed to put into operation ; still others are now being considered. At this stage it would be unfair to Parliament, and its officers, to say what is likely to be done in regard to some of the recommendations, which, if given effect, would disorganize the work of Parliament, and inconvenience its members. </para>
            <para>In the immediate past the services of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff have not been fully utilized in the recess, owing to the suspension of the Standing Committees, and the presiding officers are seeking avenues for the further employment of these officers. The reporting of the proceedings of the High Court and other tribunals by the Crown Law Department involves, on occasions, the employment of casual reporters which is stated to cost about £1,000 per annum, and it is hoped to save that sum by utilizing the services of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff for such work during the recess, when such services are not required for the reporting of the proceedings of the Parliament, or work incidental thereto. </para>
            <para>From time to time the parliamentary refreshment-rooms have been the subject of criticism, though the critics of that department appear to have no proper realization of the difficulties associated with the transfer of the Seat of Government from Melbourne to Canberra. Because of the remoteness of Canberra from large centres of population' waiters and casual help in other capacities are not available for engagement at peak periods, as was the case when the Federal Parliament sat in Melbourne. Consequently, when the Parliament was transferred to Canberra a staff of permanent employees had to be engaged in excess of the number of the permanent staff which met all our requirements in Melbourne. For a time the staff of the refreshment-rooms was therefore somewhat overloaded in recess, when there was not sufficient work to keep every person fully employed. Such additional expenditure was unavoidable on the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra. The electors of Australia, however; in voting for the Constitution, determined that there should be  a national capital in federal territory, and they must accept the responsibility for the necessary consequences of their action. They certainly have no ground for complaint that the expenses of Parliament are greater than they were when the Parliament met in Melbourne. But a gradual unloading of excess officers is taking place; where possible these are being absorbed in other departments. </para>
            <para>Substantial savings are also being made in connexion with both the quantity and the quality of materials supplied to the several parliamentary departments. </para>
            <para>Some honorable senators appear to fear that the privileges of members are in danger. The term " autocrat " and other strong expressions have been used in this connexion. If the word " autocrat " means a person who does something unpleasant, it certainly cannot be applied to the presiding officers, for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and I have not caused the privileges of members to be interfered with in the slightest degree. The privileges which members have enjoyed in the past will remain. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pinner</inline> commenced his investigation, I took good care to tell him that members' privileges did not come within the scope of his inquiry. The privileges of members are in the custody of Parliament itself, and the presiding .officers do not propose to interfere with them. </para>
            <para>A comparison of the expenditure of the Senate for the years 1925-26  -  the last year before the transfer of the seat of government to Canberra - with the expenditure in subsequent years, may interest honorable senators. Salaries in the Senate department cost £6,632 in 1925-26. Every detail of the. Estimates for 1933-34 has been carefully considered, with the result that a saving of £1,070, compared with the expenditure for 1925-26 is expected. Australia was on the eve of the depression in 1930-31. That year the estimated expenditure ' of the Senate, including contingencies, amounted' to £11,922, compared with £8,855 for 1933-34-  -  an estimated saving of £3,067. The vote for the Senate, including contingencies, has been reduced by about 25 per cent., which is considerably more than is provided for in the Premiers plan. </para>

                and I will not interfere with the present arrangement regarding the refreshment-rooms. The presiding officers regard as totally impracticable the suggestion in the press that the parliamentary dining-rooms should supply meals only at mid-day, and that at other times members should provide for themselves. We regard as purely visionary - I shall not use a stronger term - the expectation of some of the people of this country that the parliamentary dining rooms should be run on a profit and loss basis. No refreshment-room connected with any parliament in the world has ever shown a profit; none has been expected to do so. As honorable senators know, many dining-rooms conducted by private enterprise are run at a loss, either for the convenience and comfort of the staff employed or as a means of attracting trade to other departments which produce profits. A deficit must necessarily be expected in connexion with the dining-room of Parliament. I give credit to my predecessor for his efforts to reduce the cost of the refreshment rooms. In 1930, its balance-sheet showed a loss of £7,074. That loss was reduced to £6,007 in 1931. Last year the loss was further reduced to £4,289. Notwithstanding the difficulties, those losses have been reduced by £2,784 in three years. These figures show that those entrusted with the expenditure of the people's money in connexion with Parliament have kept a careful watch on expenditure with a view to avoiding waste.
            </para>
            <para>In no circumstances do I propose to make the report public; but when the budget is before the Senate, I shall give what information I can in regard to the departments of the Parliament. </para>

                    <para>[11.44]. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - The interesting statement which you, sir, have given to the Senate, is one which I feel sure honorable senators would like to discuss, with the object either of eliciting further information or of expressing their opinions. We recognize that that is a legitimate desire on their part, and think that, instead of attempting to obtain information by a series of questions, it would be better to provide an opportunity to discuss the subject. I therefore propose to move the adjournment of the Senate at an early hour on Tuesday evening next, to enable honorable senators, who may so desire, to discuss the statement. </para>

                    <para>Statements in the Senate last night that the Leader of the Opposition had been approached by Country party senators with a suggestion for a coalition to defeat the Government on general tariff policy, were to-day described as fantastic by the senators concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> (Country party, New South Wales) denied that the party had made any such proposals, and that he had even mentioned the matter to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> (State Labour, New South Wales). "On the face of it a statement that we, as low tariffists, would seek an alliance with the high tariff Labour group, is absurd." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> (Country party, Victoria) also denied that he had made any move. "As we were leaving the chamber at the adjournment, I said to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and one or two others, 'Why don't you vote for it? You should do so. All senators should support the proposal ' ". " That is the only time I said anything about the matter to any of the Labour senators ", added <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott.</inline></para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That statement gives the lie direct to the statement that I made in the Senate, I think the night before last. Neither I nor any one else on this side, so far as I am aware, ever made a statement to the effect that we desired to arrange a coalition with the Country party. We never mentioned such a thing. The statement I made in the Senate was that my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn,</inline> and I, were approached, and asked to join the Country party in supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston's</inline> amendment. </para>

                    <para>SenatorRAE. - I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> is absent from the chamber at the moment; but I would remind him that he came to the room occupied by the political group of which I am a member, where he spent from twenty minutes to half-an-hour in discussing tariff proposals. He then suggested that it would be good business on our part to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston's</inline> amendment to the tariff schedule. After such statements have been made, I think that it is extraordinary that there should be an attempt to repudiate them through the press.Whatever my faults may be, I have never been accused of intriguing to win support, or of making false statements. What I said the other night is absolutely correct, and I defy any one to truthfully refute it. </para>

The importations of leather belting from the United Kingdom were valued at £2,000, and from the United States of America, at a little over £1,200. The importations of rubber belting from the United Kingdom were valued at a few hundred pounds, and those from the United States of America at approximately £1,000. This subject was reported upon by the Tariff Board on the 21st November, 1930. The Board stated that: - </para>

                        <para>The applicant in this case estimated the Australian production of leather belting as £500,000 on the basis of wholesale selling prices. Importations of leather belting for the year 1928-29 (the last year for which complete figures are available) amounted to £15,226. Adding duty to this figure a landed duty paid cost of £20,329 is arrived at. Comparing this latter amount with Australian production it will be seen that local manufacturers hold over 96 per cent. of the Australian trade in leather belting. The opinion was, however, expressed by one Australian manufacturer of belting that importations of leather belting would consist very largely of round belting for use on sewing machines. </para>

            <para>Importations of rubber belting for the year 1928-1929 amounted to £10,030 or a landed duty paid value of £13,871. Inquiry by the board has elicited the fact that the value of the production of this belting by Australian manufacturers is approximately £250,000 per annum. It will therefore be seen that local manufacturers hold in the vicinity of 95 per cent. of this trade. </para>

                    <para>. - This is, perhaps, one of the most important items which the Senate will be called upon to discuss. Belting plays a vital part in both primary and secondary production. Any one who has had any experience of manufacturing knows that belting repairs and renewals form a considerable part of the running expenses of a factory. This is particularly so in regard to the heavy belting which usually connects the prime mover with the main shaft. There is a heavy duty on foreign belting which, of course, includes importations from the United States of America, where some of the best-quality belting is produced. Belting is used in all branches of primary production, as well as in factories. It is employed to drive separators, circular saws, chaff-cutters, and many other machines. In making this proposal for the reduction of the British duty, I ought to receive the support of Labour senators. I ask them on this occasion to abandon their high duty principles, which are running the country into ruin. No doubt, if the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Pearce) were here, he would seize on this as another attempt by the Country party to seduce members of the Labour partyto support low tariffs. One of our greatest difficulties in Australia to-day is the rigidity of costs within the Commonwealth. We must reduce internal costs if we are to conduct our businesses successfully. On top of the duties listed in the schedule, the users of belting have to pay primage and exchange, which makes its cost heavier still. </para>

I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> that much of the raw material used in the construction of belting is of Australian origin. That, of course, does not apply to rubber, but it is true of leather, canvas, &amp;c. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy,</inline> and other so-called champions of the primary producers, that a special brand of "mangrovite " leather belting produced in New South Wales is tanned with mangrove bark, which is largely obtained in Australia, while wattle bark is also widely used for tanning. Leather belting of all descriptions is manufactured within the Commonwealth, and the raw material for leather belting, as for green hide belting, is furnished by Australian stock-raisers. Why the Country party should seek to reduce the duty on belting I fail to understand, except that that is in accordance with its policy of tariff slashing. </para>

                <para>SenatorCOLLINGS.- Yes, and that kind of belting is being made in Australia of a quality equal to anything produced anywhere in the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> said that belting was responsible for a considerable portion of the overhead cost of running a factory. No one knows that better than I do. During the time that I worked in factories, Australian belting was not so generally used as now, and there was a lingering prejudice in favour of imported belting, particularly that from America, where the manufacturers had had long and varied experiencein its production. I was long enough in the business to see that antipathy to locally-made belting disappear. To-day, I believe, all the biggest manufacturing concerns in Australia are usingAustralian belting, and their overhead costs for renewals,&amp;c., are no greater than when imported belting was used almost exclusively. </para>

I knew what belting was ordered, and I knew the result of the various tests which were conducted. I believe that, when an item of which an honorable senator has had personal experience is before the Senate, he should get up and say what he knows about it. Belt-manufacturing is an important industry in Australia, and this applies to the manufacture of rubber belting, as well as to that of leather belting. There can be no doubt whatever regarding the quality of the Australian product, of its economical production, or of the satisfaction experienced by those who use it. I hope that the item will not be interfered with, because any reduction of duty would strike a blow at a most valuable Australian enterprise. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that more significance should be attached to the non-appearance of applicants than has been given to it in the board's report. Perhaps the manufacturers, seeing that they already enjoyed a substantial monopoly, thought it best not to stir up an inquiry. The Minister's statement that the local manufacturers already supply 96 per cent. of the local market applies, I presume, to all kinds of belting. That approaches perilously near to a monopoly. I know that a new test is being applied in respect of many industries, the manufacturers putting their case in this way : " We do not want to raise prices, but we do want the Australian market to ourselves." That is merely a euphuism for saying, " We want prohibition ; we do not want any competition from abroad." A dangerous position will arise if any Australian industry is given an absolute monopoly. That is not the policy of the most ardent and deep-dyed protectionists in this country. </para>

                        <para>- That is the tendency in all industries. This matter not only affects the primary producers, but it also deeply concerns all industries, secondary and primary. No factory can be established without belting, and every secondary industry is concerned about getting it at competitive prices. When we were told yesterday of the quality of locally-made binder twine, and of the efficiency of the industry, it was pointed out that the industry got its raw material free, and that that accounted for it being  able to supply a good product at a reasonable rate. If other industries would realize that that argument goes to the root of all applications for high duties, it would assist us to find out what should be the limit of the protection granted in these cases. It is best not to go to extremes in tariff matters. I should have preferred that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy's</inline> first step on the right path had been to move for the reduction of this duty down to, say, 25 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator attacks various Australian industries, and hopes to improve them by lowering the amount of protection that they now enjoy. We admit frankly that those in charge of local industries will often exploit their opportunities to the full ; but we maintain that that difficulty would be overcome, not by a reduction of duties, but rather by a limitation of profits. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> has no faith in State control. Yet the sugar industry of Queensland affords a good example of what can be done by government action in the interests of the people. </para>

                        <para>- But Queensland helps the other States. The sugar industry affords a capital illustration of the valueof organized production, marketing, and consumption. Personally, I regard it. as grossly unfair for members of the Country party to assert, and reiterate, that the local manufacturers are receiving an exchange advantage of from 25 to 30 per cent. When the report of the Tariff Board on that matter comes to hand, I think it will be shown that that statement is not justified. </para>

                        <para>- We should have it as soon as possible; but preference to local manufacturers cannot be given by juggling with currency or exchange. We, on this side of the chamber, realize that the real value of an article is governed by the amount of socially necessary labour time involved in its production, and fluctuations in exchange cannot, in the long run, affect real values ; any apparent extra protection by medium of exchange is inevitably overtaken by rising costs. Ford's works, I recently read, have had their costs greatly increased as the result of the exchange manipulation. </para>

                    <para>. -  When this matter was before the Tariff Board, an effort was made to obtain an increase of the duties, so that camel-hair belting might be excluded. The contention submitted to the board was that satisfactory belting could be made locally out of Australian and New Zealand hides, Australian hark, and chrome alum from Great Britain. The question considered was whether a higher duty should be placed on camel-hair belting, so that the whole of the demand would be for Australian-made belting. The board deemed it desirable to enable camel-hair belting to be imported, with a view to keeping up the standard of the locally-made commodity. The importers of camel-hair belting claim that their article has special advantages. This matter will be reconsidered by the Tariff Board. The increase of the foreign rate is the result of the application of the Ottawa formula. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to know whether this is the principal item covering these vehicle's. While I agree with the group system of dealing with the schedule, I must say that it is sometimes difficult for honorable senators to keep track of the items. This is particularly the case in respect of divisions which contain only a small number of items. I have been informed that a consignment of bicycles from Japan has either been landed, or is about to be landed in Australia, at the ridiculously low cost of 26s. each It is obvious that Australian manufacturers of bicycles cannot compete under such conditions. What is the Government's attitude in regard to this consignment? The Australian bicycle manufacturing industry has been established for many years, and it deserves reasonable protection. </para>

The general rate has been increased by 5 per cent., in order to make a margin of 15 per cent. in favour of British importations. Our importations of perambulators and go-carts is not great. In 1930-31, the value of these goods imported from the United Kingdom was £1,900, and from other countries, £43. In 1931-32, we imported only £900 worth of perambulators, and the goods come solely from the United Kingdom. </para>

                    <para>. - The manufacture of hand bags and purse bags, baskets, and fancy boxes, has not been the subject of a report by the Tariff Board recently. The previous Administration imposed an ad valorem duty or surcharge of 50 per cent. British, but that was altered, as from the 1st September, 1932, and the general rate was increased by 5 per cent. to provide the margin of preference stipulated in the Ottawa agreement. It may interest the honorable senator to know that, in 1931-32, our total imports of this class of goods were valued at £31,137, of which Great Britain supplied £13,000, while in the following year our imports from Britain had declined in value to £4,000. In the former year our imports from Japan and Germany were about equal, the total from each country being approximately £6,000, and from other countries about £9,000 worth. The reduction of the volume of imports, I assume, was due to the exceedingly high special duty imposed by the previous Administration, and as. these bags are regarded as luxury goods, the duties imposed are for revenue purposes, as well as for the protection of local industry. Baskets are made in institutions for the blind. </para>

                    <para>. - The duties in these several sub-items present a problem to me. On crochet, knitting, mercerized, and embroidery cotton, put up for household purposes, the ad valorem duties are 25 per cent. British, and 42½ per cent. general, whereas sewing thread and sewing cotton, put up for household use in reels up to and including 400 yards are free British, and 15 per cent. general, while sewing threads and sewing cottons, n.e.i., carry a duty of 25 per cent. British, and 42½ per cent. general. The differentiation between these duties seems to be so extraordinary as to require an explanation. From what I know of the manufacturing industry in Australia, sewing cotton or thread is imported in very large spools containing 1,000 yards or more. I offer no objection to sewing cotton and sewing thread for general household use being admitted free, but I fail to see why there should be a substantial duty on sewing thread and sewing cotton simply because they are put up in spools exceeding 400 yards. </para>

                <para class="block">The request is made in order to permit the importation of Scotch barley malt pot-still whisky for blending in bond with Australian whisky. An import duty of 17s. per proof gallon is provided, and when the whisky is cleared from bond as a blended whisky, an excise duty of 28s. per proof gallon will be payable, bringing the total duty on the imported portion of the blended whisky up to 45s. per proof gallon, the equivalent of the present import duty on Scotch whisky. Blended whisky produced in Australia requires to be partly spirit distilled from barley malt by potstill or similar process and partly spirit distilled from other grain. The blend must contain at least 25 per cent, of barley malt whisky. The United Distillers Proprietary Limited, which is producing whisky in Victoria, states that the distinctive qualities which have made Scotch whiskies the world's standard are due to the peculiar characteristics of the Scotch barley malt pot-still elements, and has represented that the company can produce in Australia a whisky comparable in flavour and quality with imported whisky only if it be allowed to use in the production of whisky here, a proportion not exceeding 20 per cent, of Scotch pot-still, pure barley-malt whisky. A whisky would then be available to the public which would have the characteristics of Scotch whisky, but which would be mostly Australian produce. The extent to which the imported malt whisky would he allowed to be used would be 20 per cent. of theblend. To ensure that the use of Australian pure barley malt whisky is not unduly displaced, it is proposed to require, under the excise item, that the minimum proportion of such Australian whisky to be contained in the final product shall be 15 per cent. The minimum proportion of pure barley malt whisky at present required in Australian blended whisky is 25 per cent. This minimum will be maintained under this proposal, but it will be made up of at least 15 per cent. Australian whisky. There is nothing to prevent the applicants under present conditions from making this or any other blend of imported and Australian whiskies, if they do it out of bond, at the same total duty, import and excise, as will be payable if this requested amendment is made. The duties on spirits, however, are so high that blending is done in bond whenever practicable, in order to escape payment of duty until the goods go into consumption, and to save payment of duty on waste. The advantages that will accrue to the trade under this item are that 28s. per proof gallon will not have to be paid until the whisky contained in the blend is cleared for home consumption under the excise tariff, and the avoidance of payment on waste. The equivalent of the full import duty will be paid on the imported spirit used in the blend. The blend will, in the opinion of the distillers, produce a whisky more acceptable to the Australianpalate, and should increase consumption, while the revenue will lose nothing, as the same total rate will be payable. Should the anticipated increase in consumption be realized, the revenue will naturally benefit. </para>

                        <para>- Their purpose is twofold - protective, and to supplement the revenue. I am opposed to any cutting down of the protection afforded to Australian whisky. We make an excellent spirit in this country, and, were it not that we needed additional revenue, we should be justified in prohibiting the importation of whisky. The tradition as to the superiority of Scotch whisky has been so long established that many people will not give the local article a trial. I am confident that those who do so find it superior to the Scotch product, and I am in favour of popularizing our own whisky to such an extent that eventually a demand will be created for it even in Scotland. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> will have to advance some very good reasons before I support his amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - This  sub-item has been so well debated on previous occasions that I shall not labour it now. I can appreciate the desire for haste on the part of the Government, which would like to see the sub-item go through without discussion. Just prior to the time when the Bruce Page Government crashed, the duty on this sub-item was 35s. a gallon, and that Administration augmented the impost by 2s., making it 37s. a gallon. The then Opposition made a dreadful fuss about the increase, yet, immediately the Scullin Government came into power it slammed on another 8s., making the duty 45s. a gallon. The impost is purely a revenueraising device, and it is interesting to go back to pre-war days and compare the figures giving the consumption of whisky and the revenue derived from this duty, for the examination discloses that as the duty has increased the revenuehas decreased. I was told by a responsible Minister, prior to the holding of the Ottawa Conference, that this was one of the matters that would be discussed at that gathering. Without doubt, 45s. a gallon, or  7s.  6d. a bottle, is a wicked impost on an article that cannot satisfactorily be produced outside Scotland. I should like to go further than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> and move to reduce the rate by 8s. a gallon. It amuses me to see how gun-shy the Government is whenever this item comes up for attention; it now wants to rush the matter through without discussion. </para>

                        <para>- If the remark is offensive, I withdraw it. It was founded on the statement of the Minister that he wanted to get through these sub-items without wasting time. The remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> were beside the point, for Australian and Scotch whiskies are entirely different articles, and, therefore, there can be no competition between them. Those who like the Australian product are welcome to it, but those who prefer Scotch whisky should have a reasonable opportunity to obtain it. Frequently, doctors prescribe it as a medicine, and it is rough on those who have to purchase it that such an exorbitant duty should be imposed. I support the amendment that has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - I support my Leader, and oppose the amendment. The State of Queensland manufactures a splendid rum, and it would be inconsistent if  a  representative of that State sat quiescent, and allowed freetraders to tilt at the reasonable protection that is afforded to Australian whisky. I am not a heavy drinker of this spirit, but I take a little during winter time, partly from a medicinal point of view. Not very long ago, while in Brisbane, I was introduced to Old Court whisky, and I pronounced it to be an excellent product. I have been drinking whisky for the last 30 years in all parts of the world, and I cannot see that our product differs materially from that which is produced in Scotland. No doubt some will claim that the Scottish product is somewhat mellower, but it is all a matter of taste.Whisky is used medicinally, many doctors prescribing it for nervous dyspepsia, and, if the doctor's prescription is adhered to, no harm can result. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> said that he looked forward to the day when we shall be exporting our whisky to Scotland. I am half Scotch myself, and in the days when a nip of whisky and " split " was being retailed in the best bars in Piccadilly for 6d., I visited Sligachan, a whiskyproducing centre in Scotland, where, when driving past a country inn, I invited my companions to have a drink. Being a humble Australian who at the time had not travelled very widely, I thought that in the home of whisky I should be able to purchase it for less than I was accustomed to paying, but to my astonishment I was asked to pay 3s. for three whiskies and water, whereas in any other part of the world, including Australia, the price for a nobbier of whisky and soda was then only 6d. In my early years in Victoria there was on the market an Australian whisky produced by a company with which, I believe, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> M. Joshua was associated. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that Australia can produce as good a whisky as Scotland. A large sum is annually sent out of this country for this spirit; the Minister is, probably, in a position to furnish the exact figures. If the duty were 85s. instead of 45s. a gallon, there would be a much greater demand for the cheaper Australian spirit. Although whisky is not distilled in Queensland, to be consistent I, with other honorable senators from that State, must oppose the amendment, because we shall shortly endeavour to have restored to the old rate the duty on Queensland rum, or, if that be not acceptable to the committee, to reduce the excise on that product. </para>

                        <para>- I. suggest that at this particular juncture no good purpose would be served by discussing these duties at length. From the point of view of the Treasury, an item of this class is important, because we collect a considerable revenue from spirits, beer and narcotics, and, therefore, the Treasury is vitally concerned in fixing the duties at a rate which will secure the largest amount of revenue. I am not losing sight of the protective incidence of t.he rates which, of course, depends upon the difference between the duty on imports and the excise levied on local production. It would be impossible, of Course, to deal .with these duties without taking due cognizance of the excise duties so as to maintain the protective incidence of the tariff. When we look at the figures of the actual imports of whisky during the last few years, we have reason to question whether the customs duties are not, perhaps, so operating as to give us less revenue than we might reasonably anticipate from this particular source. The value of the whisky imported in bulk in 1928-29 was £1,175,000; in 1929-30, £1,048,000; in 1930-31, £440,000; and in 1931-32, £165,000. In view of those figures Ave must necessarily consider whether the duties have been fixed at a rate which may actually prevent us from getting the maximum revenue from, this source. </para>

                    GREENE.Of course it has. There has been, not a great, but still a material fall in the consumption of Australian whisky, but 1 suggest that the fall in the value of imported whisky from £1,175,000 to £165,000, in the course of three years, is clue to something more than the depression. ,

                        <para>- Honorable senators can form their own conclusions about that. There is, in respect of these spirit duties, another factor to which I draw the attention of honorable senators. They will find, if they glance at the whole series of spirit duties, that a balance. has been preserved between them, which it is important should be maintained. These duties are far reaching, as they include perfumery and other spirits, and the balance must be maintained between one spirit and another. For that reason, I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> that it is undesirable, at this moment at all events, to reduce the duty on whisky. The only objective in reducing the duty would, from the point of view of the ' Treasury, be to increase consumption, although that of course might by certain people be regarded as a heinous offence. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> will realize that it is exceedingly difficult to translate a reduction of duty by 5s. a gallon into something worth while from the point of view, not only of the ' consumer, but also of the .Treasury, if the objective he to obtain additional revenue as a result of increased consumption. I, therefore, suggest that honorable senators leave this item as it is. Although I can make no promises, I can inform honorable senators that the item is being seriously considered by the Government. What we shall do I cannot tell them at the moment. This item is indissolubly linked up with our financial policy, and I hope that the Senate will have a further opportunity to consider the matter. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad that the Government is in communication with the British Government regarding the duties on spirits, and is giving close attention to the matter from the point of view of the revenue involved. If it wishes to obtain more revenue from this source, it can attain that end by further reducing the duty on whisky. If spirits could be sold at 9d. a nobbler, instead of1s., there would be a surprising increase of revenue. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say offhand, because the position varies in different parts of Australia. The strength at which spirits are sold is fixed by State licensing laws, and varies in different States. My experience is that the drinkers of Scotch whisky do not drink Australian whisky to any extent. It is true that the con sumption of Australian whisky is increasing, but not among those who are accustomed to drinking Scotch whisky. Having heard the views of the Government on this subject, and knowing that the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> has always been an advocate of lower duties on spirits, I ask permission towithdraw my amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that the Minister will not agree to the postponement of sub-item (d) which deals with rum, because it would be better to discuss the position of the Australian rum industry when the excise duties are before us. The disabilities from which the Queensland producers of rum are suffering could be removed by a reduction of the excise duty. They complain that the protective margin is smaller in the case of rum than in respect of other spirits. On brandy the margin of protection is 18s. a gallon, and. on gin and whisky it is 17s. a gallon, whereas in the case of rum the margin is only 6s. a gallon. It has been said that the lower protective margin in the case of rum is due to rum not being so good a spirit as the others. I am no judge of their relative qualities as beverages, although I may take rum as a medicine. </para>

                        <para>- Some of them, I understand, called it " Nelson's blood ", because it improved their fighting qualities. Queensland senators are concerned with the duties on rum, not because they are heavy consumers 'of the spirit, but because it is produced in their State. Were the whole of the rum, whisky and gin in the world poured into the sea, the world would probably be the better for it. On the other hand, I know that many men like a little stimulant at times, because of nerve strain and in order to enable them to meet the competition of their fellows. We must, however, deal with things as they are, and one fact which stands out is that a certain quantity of rum is entering this country from Jamaica to the detriment of the Australian rum industry. Very little rum is produced in Australia outside Queensland, and in that State the position of the industry is far from satisfactory. Only about 8,500 gallons of Australian rum is produced outside Queensland, whereas one Queensland distillery has a capacity of 100,000 gallons per annum and the distillery at Bundaberg has an even greater capacity. Two big distilleries in Queensland have recently closed down, and others are barely able to carry on. We have to decide how best we can help this industry. </para>

                            Bedford, a member of the Queensland Parliament, tells the story of a club, some of whose members were drinkers of rum and whisky, and others were teetotallers. Those who drank spirits got rid of the teetotallers from the club, and introduced in their place a number of drinkers of rum and whisky. By that means, the club, which previously was in serious financial difficulty, got out of debt. We might convert the losses on the Parliamentary refreshment room into a profit by allowing only drinkers of rum and whisky to enter this Parliament. The Ottawa agreement stands in the way of the making of the duty on rum 40s. a gallon, and since at this juncture we cannot deal with the excise duty on this spirit, it would appear that all we can do now is to say that the Queensland rum industry is not being treated fairly.

                    <para>Prior to the Ottawa Conference, Australian rum enjoyed a protective margin of l1s. per proof gallon over foreign rum, that is to say that, whilst the excise duty on Australian rum was 30s., the import duty on foreign rum was 41s. The recent decision at Ottawa, however, was to reduce the import duty On foreign rum, embracing as it does all West Indian rum, to 36s., and there is distinct evidence in the short time that has elapsed since the decision became effective, of an increase in the number of gallons of imported rum. It seems quite unnecessary to remind you that all this imported rum is the produce of molasses produced entirely by black labour. </para>
                    <para>As the Ottawa decision seems to be irrevocable, the only other method by which we may obtain some redress is by a reduction in the excise duty of 30s. per proof gallon on Australian rum.Rum is produced in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, but at least 75 per cent. is produced by the three Queensland distilleries. Whisky, on the other hand, is produced almost exclusively in Victoria. </para>

                    <para>In the light of present day knowledge wo say that the above conclusion is entirely erroneous.Rum is now universally acknowledged to be equally as pure and wholesome a drink as whisky. This, then, is apparently the only reason why a margin of 2s. per gallon was decided on in favour of Australian whisky. Just here it might be appropriate to mention that Australian gin, which is produced in Victoria, is dutiable at 30s.per gallon the same as Australian rum, yet Australian rum must be matured in wood for two years before it can go into consumption, whilst gin is sold freshly distilled and need not be matured at all. </para>

At the very least it should be reduced to the same levelas Australian whisky, viz., 28s., as, in our opinion, no valid reason can be advanced for the present difference of 2s. in favour of Australian whisky. If this were done it would, aswe have said, offset to some extent the concession which our delegates at Ottawa saw fit to grant to a product of black labour. </para>

We have stored in our spirit bonds at the present time 300,000 liquid gallons of rum, equivalent to nearly 500,000 proof gallons, varying in age from one and a half to five years, which, partly on account of the high excise duty and partly to the distressing economic conditions, is going into consumption at a very slow rate. In fact, notwithstanding our enormous storage capacity, we have not distilled any rum for over twelve months. </para>

This amendment resulted in a considerable increase in the revenue obtained by the Administration from the sale of liquor. ' In 1931, the system of liquor permits was altered to the issue of weekly permits to "approved citizens ". The amount of wine and beer under the permits was at the same time increased twofold, with the object of encouraging the consumption of light Australian wine and beer in lieu of spirits. No liquor can be imported into Norfolk Island except by the Administration. </para>

He states that valuable rains have fallen in eastern Australia, and will prove a useful addition in Queensland to the falls that took place there a week ago. He adds that the latest rainfall will be particularly valuable in the wheat areas of New South Wales and the pastoral districts in central and southeastern Queensland. Little rain has fallen in the dry country in the far west and north-west of New South Wales. The report that I have before me shows that the rain has been fairly general, and that at most of the stations it is still falling. There has been general but light rain in Victoria.

                            <para>-  Yes; when the honorable senator said that the Government had been saved by the votes of the Lang group, it was a direct slur upon a group of honorable senators who had every right to vote with the Government. Indirectly, it was a slur upon honorable senators of the Federal Labour party because of their association with the Government in the various divisions that had been taken. The various press reports that I have seen simply start out with the statement: " <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacDonald</inline> made the disclosure." But I consider that </para>

                    <para class="block">I had every justification for the action that I took. I had no intention of making any such disclosure, but hearing a member of the Country party casting a slur at honorable senators on this side, I deemed it time to mention what I knew. It was a case of tit for tat, and I had sufficient provocation for what I said. But I mentioned no names. Astounding as my declaration may have been, I was particularly astounded when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> rose and mentioned the names of two honorable senators who had approached the members of the Lang group; because, obviously, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy's</inline> statement that the Lang group had saved the Government was entirely wrong. That group could not have saved the Government if the seven members of the Federal Labour party had consistently voted with the Country party and the insurgents on the Government side during the important divisions that had been taken on the tariff schedule. The Lang group did not save the Government. The Federal Labour party saved it by voting consistently with it, for the very good reason that the tariff policy of the Government is more acceptable to the Labour party than that of any other party in the Senate. I have no desire to reopen any discussion on this matter, but I thought it advisable to clear the air, in view of the garbled reports which have been published in the press. It occurs to me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> on returning to this chamber after the lapse of. some years, that considerable carelessness is shown by honorable senators in the alignment of parties and the seating of senators in this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> said that we had not been approached by an honorable senator " on behalf of " the Country party. I find, on referring to my <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proofs, that I spoke of an honorable senator " belonging to " the Country party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> disclosed  to me for the first time that he was the leader in this chamber of the so-called Country party, though he sits among a bunch of senators owing allegiance to the United Australia party. </para>
