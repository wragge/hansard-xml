                            <para>- The conditions of tender are at present under consideration by the Government, and until a decision has been reached, no disclosure of them can be made. They are not, however, likely to depart from the announced policy of the Government, and, therefore, the Government will proceed to invite tenders. Should, however, any variation of government policy be contemplated, members of the Parliament in both chambers will have an opportunity to discuss it in connexion with the budget, which will be presented before tenders can be accepted. No inquiry into the composition of any company likely to tender is called for at this stage. </para>

In the meantime, and before the embargo was imposed on importations, merchants in Adelaide and Perth had placed orders overseas for supplies of glass, but, owing to the virtual prohibition which was then placed on the importation of glass, they were permitted to take only 28 per cent, of their orders out of bond.

Under the Scullin tariff, there was a duty on 16-oz. glass of 12s. 6d. per 100 square feet, British preferential, while the general tariff was 16s. 8d. Under the duties which prevailed after -the Government had accepted the Tariff Board's recommendation, some consignments were imported by merchants from Adelaide and Perth, and in one instance an order worth £S8 in London cost £154 when landed in Australia. Later, when the Glass Company approached the Government, the Tarin* Board's recommendations were brushed aside, though I cannot understand why the Government should have allowed itself 'to be influenced by an organization which enjoys such exceptional trade advantages in this country. There was no excuse for such weakness, particularly having regard to the Tariff Board's report. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> has stated, time after time, that the Government proposes to be guided by the Tariff Board's recommendation, but, in this instance, although it allowed itself to be so guided for a little while, it eventually yielded to the representations of the Glass Company.

The report' goes on - </para><quote><para>In the terms of the Customs Tariff Act the company has no claim to the duty until glass is produced in Australia in reasonable quantities and of satisfactory quality, and the board has already expressed the view that these conditions have not yet been fulfilled. As stated above, duties equivalent to 100 per cent. (British preferential tariff), and 17« per cent, (general tariff) would be necessary to secure the market to Australian-made glass. Moreover, most of the protection would have to be used in fixing the price of the Australian glass. The board is not prepared to recommend these duties. . . . The board considers that in view of the importance of glass in the building industry, higher rates than these would not be justified, and has only increased the previous recommendation with a desire to meet the very difficult situation that has developed. The industry based on se high a cost would be of doubtful value on economic grounds, but the board is actuated in recommending it by the fact that the deferred duty encouraged the installation of the factory. The board further considers that for the twelve months' period importations should continue to be rationed under cover of the prohibition now operating. On the evidence submitted at the inquiry, the board is of opinion that at the present moment the annual consumption in Australia might lie placed at 5.000,000 square feet, and it is considered that 3,750,000 feet of that quantity should be permitted import. The disposal of glass now in bond, because of the prohibition, does not come within the terms of the reference to the board, but the board considers on the evidence submitted at the inquiry, that the conditions of the market, and also the circumstances under which the prohibition was issued, warrant the immediate release of this glass at the rates of duty now operating. </para></quote><para class="block">Another telegram from an Adelaide glass distributor is as follows : - </para><quote><para>Consider Parliament should carry out Tariff Board report.

The only part of the Tariff Board's recommendation to which effect was not given was that relating to the rationing of importations. The Tariff Board has furnished two reports on glass in fairly rapid succession, the first in August, 1932, and the second in January, 1933. In September, 1932, the duties on glass were reduced to the 1921-30 level, the principal reasons being stated as follows: - </para></talk.start><list type="loweralpha"><item label="(a)"><para>The local manufacturer was not in a position to produce commercially nor was it clear when production on a commercial basis could be expected; </para></item><item label="(b)"><para>The rates of duty were so high that they would seriously add to the cost in Australia of an important commodity without commensurate advantages to Australia. </para></item></list><para>The board stated that the high duties then obtaining would have meant an added cost to the community of over £150,000 per annum if the whole of  the  requirements were imported, and at that date glass had not been successfully manufactured in Australia. ' </para><para>I ask honorable senators to note that point, as it has an important bearing on the subject. At that time glass was not being commercially manufactured in Australia. </para><para>In view of the claim of local manufacturers that the position with regard to local production had greatly improved since June, the time when the board held its first inquiries, the question was again referred to the Tariff Board on 23rd September, 1932. The board was asked the following questions: - </para><list type="decimal-dotted"><item label="1."><para>The capacity of the applicant company to supply the Australian market with suitable glass in sufficient quantities at a reasonable price; </para></item><item label="2."><para>The rates of duty necessary for the protection of the industry, providing the industry is efficiently organized. </para></item></list><para>Concurrent with the reference of the question to the Tariff Board, a proclamation was issued prohibiting the importation of plain clear sheet glass, except with the consent of the Minister. Delivery has been allowed of all the glass on order at the time the prohibition was proclaimed, the deliveries aggregating some 4,000,000 square feet. Rationing did occur in respect of 4,000,000 square feet already ordered, and the whole of that quantity has been distributed to importers. </para><para>The Tariff Board furnished its second report on plain clear sheet glass on 26th January,. 1933. The board is of opinion that the justification of 'protective duties is dependent on the ability of the local manufacturer to supply the needs of the Australian market, and that three aspects should be considered, namely: (1) quality; (2) supply; and (3) price. Briefly, the board's conclusions with regard to these three aspects are as follow :  - </para><quote><para>The board concluded that, although there has been an improvement in the average quality produced, there have been considerable fluctuations and variations of the quality marketed. </para></quote><para class="block">Honorable senators will recall the discussion in this chamber, in which I participated, in regard to the prohibition of importations. I then explained that the works engaged in the production of plain sheet glass had been equipped at a cost of £300,000. The failures which occurred were due not to any defect in the equipment, but in operating the plant. These difficulties had been practically overcome when the manufacturers were again confronted with similar trouble. The board had these facts before it as also had the Government, as well as a few additional points. The board's conclusions continue - </para><quote><para>It was also remarked by the board that the average quality of the glass produced up to the temporary closing down of the factory is far below the quality of glass imported into Australia in recent years, and is not such as to fill the demands of the building trade. </para></quote><para class="block">The closing down of the works was necessary to enable certain parts of the plant to be cleaned. After examining the  volume of evidence submitted at the inquiry the board considered that the local manufacturers had failed to meet the requirements of ' the building trade in the supply of suitable plain clear sheet glass. The board points out that the local manufacturer's selling prices of the four brackets commonly ordered in 16-oz. and 21-oz. weights exceed the landed costs, of imported glass, excluding duty, but including exchange, by - British, 16-oz., 4s. 6d. per case of 100 square feet; 21-oz., 7s. 6d. per case of 100 square feet. Belgian, 16-oz., 9s. per case of 100 square feet; 21-oz., 13s. 6d. per case of 100 square feet. "With regard to the local manufacturer's contention that, by doing the bulk of distributing himself, the cost to the public will be lowered, and that the high rates imposed by the Scullin Government will not affect prices to the user, the board states that, taking all factors into consideration, it is convinced that distributing costs will be increased rather than decreased by adding seriously to' the first cost of glass to the distributing trade. The board concludes that the present selling prices of Australian plain clear sheet glass will mean increased costs to users. The board points out that the Australian market is limited, and difficulty will be experienced in disposing of the large proportion of the lower grades of glass. These factors, coupled with the costs of production as submitted by the company, led the board to the conclusion that satisfactory glass can be produced in this country only at a cost that will detrimentally affect the building industry, and that this will tend to decrease employment. Expressed in a few words, the board was of opinion that the industry is not economic, and can only bc supported at a cost too great to a dependent industry such as the building industry. </para><para>On referring the glass duties back to the board, the Minister asked, first, as to the capacity of the local sheet glass comp.any to supply the Australian market with suitable glass in sufficient quantities at a reasonable price, to which the reply was made that the company had failed to satisfy the board on all three points, namely, quality, quantity, and price. </para><para>The second question asked of the board was what rates of duty were necessary for the protection of industry, providing the industry is efficiently organized. The board was of the opinion that the industry was not efficiently organized, but that if the company could bridge the gap between costs of production then obtaining, and selling-price rates of .100 per cent., British preferential tariff, and 175 per cent., general tariff, would be necessary to secure the market to the Australian manufacturers. The board was not prepared to recommend such high rates, for the reason that they would be used in fixing the price of Australian glass. </para><para>The board recommends the present ra tes of 2s. per 100 square feet, British preferential tariff, and 4s., general tariff, with provision for deferred duties of 45 per cent., British preferential tariff, and 75 per cent.,- general tariff, such deferred duties to be either operated or terminated at the end of twelve months, according to whether it can or cannot be proved that such duties would be effective. The deferred rates now recommended are higher than those at present included in the tariff by 5 per cent., British preferential tariff, and 15 per cent., general tariff. The board is also of the opinion that for the twelve months' period importations should continue to be rationed under cover of the prohibition now operating. The present annual consumption in Australia i3 estimated by the board at 5,000,000 square feet, and the board considers that three-fourths of that quantity should be permitted importation. The Government was quite prepared" to abide by the Tariff Board's recommendation^ provided the facts Were as set out in the report. However, since the Tariff Board reported on this matter in January last, the local manufacturers have made representations to the effect that there is now a. marked difference in the condition of the industry from that in which the board then found it, in regard to both supplies and the quality of the output. On the question of price, the company states that since manufacture in Australia commenced, the prices to the user, as distinct from the distributor, have shown a marked decline. The local manufacturers claimed also that the adoption of the hoard's recommendation would result in 240 men being thrown out of employment. The importing interests contend that the board's recommendation for the continuation of the prohibition and the rationing thereunder is illogical and against the weight of evidence tendered to the board. The feasibility of rationing is also questioned. </para><para>The Government considered that it was inadvisable to accept statements made by sectional interests, but felt that an opportunity should be afforded the opposing interests to establish their statements. At present there is a sufficient quantity of glass in Australia to meet the demand for at least twelve months at the present rate of consumption. Such being the case, there is no need for further importations at present. As to the board's suggestion that importations be rationed under the cover of the existing prohibition, there are practical difficulties in rationing imports as distinct from rationing of glass in bond. It' was easy to ration the glass in bond, but almost impossible to ration further importations. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2967</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JNM</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BADMAN, Albert</name><name role="display">Senator Badman</name></talker><para>- Is not rationing contrary to governmental policy? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2967</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KTR</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCLACHLAN, Alexander</name><name role="display">Senator McLACHLAN</name></talker><para>- It is; but the honorable senator will realize the difficulty confronting the Government.

It practically recommended the sweeping away of the embargo and the very high protective tariff of the Scullin Government, which raised the price of glass by1½d. or1¾d. per lb., and the reversion to the light revenue duty of the Bruce-Page Government. The Government acted upon that report. Then this powerful combine represented to the Government and in the press that, if the former duties and the embargo were not re-imposed, a number of its employees would be immediately dismissed. The Government, which is supposed to legislate for a continent, ran for cover like a startled' hare, reimposed the embargo as quickly as it could, and again referred the matter to the Tariff Board, although the ink was hardly dry on its previous report. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2968</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KTR</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCLACHLAN, Alexander</name><name role="display">Senator McLachlan</name></talker><para>-  I regard the remarks of the honorable senator as offensive, and ask that they be withdrawn. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2968</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>- I ask the honorable senator to withdraw his remarks. </para></talk.start></continue><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2968</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KP8</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">JOHNSTON, Edward</name><name role="display">Senator E B JOHNSTON</name></talker><para>- I withdraw" them.

It is surprising that although evidence apparently reaches Ministers which induces them to refer matters back to the Tariff Board, when these matters have been sent back, that evidence does not appear to be forthcoming.' It seems that until the board presents a report that will meet with the wishes of this powerful combine, the public will obtain no relief from the merciless exploitation to which it is to be subjected under this deferred item, so soon 'as it comes into operation. Then good-bye to reasonably cheap glass in Australia. </para><para>It is interesting also to remember that the Minister who referred the matter to the board for another hearing said that there were about 5,000,000 feet of glass in Australia, and that, therefore, no harm would be done by rationing the supply for an extended period, or by placing an embargo upon importations. When that statement was made, the Minister might have added that no harm would 'be done to the fortunate owners of the glass, but the unfortunate consumers could pay and look pleasant, as they did not appear in the picture. When these deferred duties are again imposed, we shall return to much the same condition of affairs as obtained when the Scullin tariff was in operation, although, of course, the deferred duties  are not quite so heavy as those ruling under the Scullin Government's regime.

It appears to me to be remarkable that persons living in Australia, and entirely dependent on Australia for their means of livelihood, should adopt such an un-Australian attitude as is displayed by some honorable senators in the matter of the protection of our own industries. It is only within the last year or two that plain sheet glass has been manufactured to any extent in this country. It is urged that the company which makes glass in Australia has not " played the game." I am aware that not long ago this company went to the Arbitration Court, and demanded a reduction! of the wages of its employees. "With that action, of course, I have no sympathy whatever. A government carrying out the protective policy of the Australian Labour Party would see that the company was not allowed to offend in that respect, because my party stands for the "new" protection, under which the benefits given to Australian manufacturers must be shared with their employees. But .that is not the question we are now debating. It has been said that the local company makes enormous profits, because of the protection accorded to it under  .the tariff ; but are not all commercial operations conducted for private profit? "We, on this side, say that the manufacture of all the things needed for the use of the community should be carried on, not for private profit but for public benefit. It is an interesting psychological study to observe the holy horror with which some honorable senators opposite view the profits made by Australian companies, while making no protest whatever against the even .greater profits of the importing interests. I have here an extract from <inline font-style="italic">The Australian Manufacturer</inline> of the 23rd January, 1932. The document is valuable for its illustrations of the factory established at Alexandria, in New South "Wales, by Australian "Window Glass Proprietary Limited. This company began the manufacture of window glass in Australia early in 1932, and since it has been in operation it has accomplished a great deal. The document also give3 a concise account of the process of glass manufacture. </para></talk.start><para>Reference has been made to the conflicting reports submitted on different occasions by the Tariff Board, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> suggested that some mysterious influences had been at work. No definite charge was made - there never is - but the suggestion cannot be evaded. There are those who claim that there is no special virtue in consistency, and I am inclined to agree with them, excepting when fundamental matters of principle are involved. The difference between the two reports of the Tariff Board can easily be accounted for-, in the interval the conditions surrounding the manufacture of glass in Australia altered considerably. When the second report was submitted, the position in the industry was entirely different from what it was on the first occasion. </para><para>Before reading what the Australian Window Glass Proprietary Limited has to say for itself, I wish to make it clear that I have no connexion whatever with this company. I do not even know where its factory is, except that it is at Alexandria. I have never seen it, nor have I met any of the men connected with it. I have no shares in the company, which, considering the fabulous profits which it is said to be making, is obviously my misfortune. I rise to-day, as I did last year, when we were discussing the manufacture of window glass, solely because so long as I remain a member of this chamber, I shall do what I can to protect Australian industries. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2970</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K09</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PAYNE, Herbert</name><name role="display">Senator Payne</name></talker><para>- What is the date of the document which the honorable senator holds in his hand ? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2970</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K7P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">COLLINGS, Joseph</name><name role="display">Senator COLLINGS</name></talker><para>- I do not know why the honorable senator always seems suspicious regarding the date of any document from which I quote, hut I hasten to inform him that the document is dated the8th May, 1933.

As to quality -Our glass is sold on a guarantee that it is superior to that imported from Belgium - and Belgium has been the chief supplier of sheet glass to this market for years. We are prepared to submit 1,000,000 square feet of our glass to any independent tribunal at once for judgment on quality. The board's remarks' regarding quality and "the art of glassdrawing" shows the board to be ignorant on the subject and totally unfit to express an  opinion involving a technical knowledge of glass. Further than this, the board has expressed an opinion on statements made (by opponents of the industry) from six to twelve months ago - statements which subsequent events have proved to be incorrect. The truth may be ascertained by an examination of the stocks we hold and the products at present coming through the machines. We, therefore, register a definite and emphatic protest and denial of the board's finding on the quality of our glass, and submit an offer for any test that the Government cares to suggest. </para><list type="decimal-dotted"><item label="2."><para>Supply. - The board has said that it is not satisfied with the " supply " or quantity of Australian glass. This is truly a remarkable statement, and is directly contrary to the actual position. How the board has arrived at its conclusions does not appear in the report, but the answer is simple. In four months since the Australian Window Glass Company rebuilt their furnaces the production has exceeded demands by over 100 per cent., and stocks have accumulated in sufficient quantities to meet the next five months' requirements. This applies to builders' quality, picture frames, and horticultural - anything, in fact, from 12 ounces to¼ inch. We, therefore, definitely deny the board's statement regarding the inability of our company to supply requirements - we" can supply four times the present needs without any difficulty. </para></item><item label="3."><para>Price. - We pointed out in 1924 that we could not . produce as cheaply as overseas factories. We also pointed out to the present Tariff Board, however, that the price the user has to pay is more important than the price at which an overseas factory can sell to Australia. </para></item></list></quote><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2971</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>- The honorable senator has exhausted his time. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2971</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JYB</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNN, James Patrick Digger</name><name role="display">Senator DUNN</name></talker><para>.   -  A great deal of propaganda has been sent to me, in common with other honorable senators, from the  chairman  of directors of the Australian Window Glass Proprietary Limited, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. "</inline> Gunboat '.'

Unfortunately, like many other manufacturers, the allabsorbing purpose of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> is to give full range to the licence allowed him under the existing order of things, and pile up acceptable profits for his shareholders. Through his over-zealous application to that purpose, he ran foul of the trade union movement in New South Wales, for the Crystal Glass Works, Sydney - a subsidiary organization of the Australian Window Glass Proprietary Limited - endeavoured to get away with a scale of wages to its em ployees which would not have had the approval of a judge of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court; also, that company endeavoured to exploit hoy labour. I have been through the extensive works of the Australian Window Glass Proprietary Limited, which employs some 700 men and women, and I regret that it should stoop to such tactics. Fortunately, the Disputes Committee of the Trades and Labour Council, representing 75 trade unions and some 175,000 men and women, was able to persuade <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> and his colleagues to see the light, and to give the employees a fair deal. Whenever <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith,</inline> or any other representative of an Australian industry, attempts to prostitute a plank of the fighting platform of the Labour party, I shall do my utmost, by criticism, to nullify his efforts. Though these gentlemen may think that, with their " heelers," "urges," and voluminous propaganda, they can obtain the votes of most honorable senators, they will find that the representatives of my party will demand in return fair treatment and protection for those engaged in the industry concerned. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Some honorable senators have claimed that the Australian Window Glass Proprietary Limited is a combine. That may be, but it is not more a combine than is the British merger of glass companies operating under the name of Pinkerton's Limited, and situated at St. Helen's, Lancashire, England. That firm is the driving force behind the glass-making industry throughout Europe and the  British Empire. Before the war, crystal glass was manufactured largely in Austria and that part of Europe now known as Czechoslovakia. Since the application of modern science to glassmaking, the industry has progressed considerably in Belgium, and in certain parts of Germany, Bohemia, and elsewhere. The industry has been established in New South Wales, and Australian crystal glassware is now on sale in every capital city of Australia. All the ingredients necessary for glass-making, such as sand, limestone, and magnesia, are to be found in Australia, with the exception of soda ash, which, I understand, is imported from the Old" Country. It has been stated that many cases of ptomaine  poisoning have occurred through the canning of our' products in' tins, and, because of that, the Australian Glass Company has now established a subsidiary industry for the manufacture of glass containers for meat products, such as tongues. In conclusion, let me say to the representatives of the Australian Window Glass Proprietary Limited, who are at present in Canberra, that, on their return to Sydney, they can inform <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. "</inline> Gunboat " Smith that SenatorRae and myself, as representing one Labour group in this chamber, are not prepared to assist any Australian firm of manufacturers which is prostituting one of the cardinal planks of the Labour party's platform - new protection - by refusing to mete out fair treatment to its employees, and particularly its boy operatives. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2972</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KS9</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MACDONALD, John Valentine</name><name role="display">Senator MacDONALD</name></talker><para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith,</inline> the manager of this glass company, as " Gunboat " Smith.  His  reference to that gentleman recalled to my mind the saying of Napoleon about another Smith - the famous <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Smith, who resisted the siege of Acre - " That man made me miss my destiny ". So I say to this <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> that if he is not careful, he may cause the glass company to miss its destiny, which we can take to be, under proper management, the supplying of Australia with its requirements of glass. We, on this side of the chamber, are strongly in favour of the application of the policy of new protection. to Australian industries; it is only fair that when an industry is protected by the tariff from the competition of cheap-labour foreign countries, it should treat its employees decently. We know that in the past many manufacturers, who were otherwise good Australians, treated their workers as mere dumb beasts; but, since then, through the efforts of the Labour party, a great deal has been done in the direction of emancipating the workers. Before we grant the request of the Australian Window Glass Proprietary Limited for protection against foreign manufacturers, we must make certain that it is treating its employees decently. As a general rule, we believe in giving protection to Australian industries, to prevent them from being subjected to unfair foreign competition. This firm, in its propaganda, says - </para></talk.start><quote><para>A statement which is absolutely false has been circulated by the representative of a foreign company with the object of injuring the reputation of the Australian glass companies. The statement is to the' effect that the Australian Glass Manufacturers Company Limited took advantage of the tariff by increasing the selling price of stocks of imported glass sold by the company. Similar statements have been made by other opponents of the Australian glass companies, and in order to settle the question we had the matter fully ventilated at a public inquiry of the Tariff Board on figured rolled glass. </para></quote><para class="block">Whatever the report of the Tariff Board may have been, the Labour party is strongly averse to any manufacturer taking advantage of protective duties to exploit the workers and the consumers. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2972</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K7P</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">COLLINGS, Joseph</name><name role="display">Senator COLLINGS</name></talker><para>. - Some important facts relating to this industry have not yet been disclosed. When, this item was discussed in the House of Representatives in May last, some details which have been only hinted at to-day, were stated in full. I quote from a speech made on the 18th May - </para></talk.start><quote><para>The price of imported glass to-day is56s. 6d. less 33¼ per cent., less 5 per cent., or a net amount of 35s. per 100. square feet. . It is evident that . the Australian community has been exploited. Prior to the establishment of the Australian company,  glass which was valued at 12s. per 100 square feet, f.o.b. British ports, cost 56s. 6d. in Australia. The present price of Australian glass is 28s. 3d. per 100 square feet compared 'with about . 30s. in New Zealand where glass is admitted duty free. These figures must convince the committee that the establishment of the Australian Window Glass Company has conferred material benefit on Australia. Honorable members must be surprised at the condition of affairs to which the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> drew attention. I am reliably informed that, as the result of a merger, the firm of Pilkington Brothers Limited -is the onlylarge glass-making company in Great Britain. There was also an arrangement between that firm and the Belgian and American companies to form a combine, and, given the chance, those organizations would again exploit this country as they did in the past. Our only safeguard is the existence of a glass factory in Australia. In the 1932 report of the Tariff Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norbury</inline> is quoted as saying that " sheet glass can only be made economically in large quantities ". With that honorable members will agree; it is for that reason that there is only one glass factory in Australia. The Australian Window Glass Proprietary Limited has invested £300,000 in its business, and, with the assistance of protective duties, has formed what may be termed a combine. But is  it not better to have <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> combine which we can control rather than to be subjected to the operations of an overseas combine which is beyond our control, for we can control the local combine by reducing or withdrawing the duty, also through the medium of taxation. As to the prices charged, the Australian Window Glass Proprietary Limited has arranged for the distribution of builders' quality glass in the country at 38s. a single box of 100 square feet, or in 25 box lot?, at 30s. a box. Imported glass of a similar quality is being sold in Australia at 56s. 6d. a box. The company has also protected the public from exploitation in regard to figured rolled glass. <inline font-style="italic">At</inline> a recent deputation the Attorney-General asked a question similar to that asked of me to-night by the Postmaster-General. I pointed out that the manufacture' of figured rolled glass is a sideline, without which it is doubtful whether the company could carry on under existing conditions. I sincerely hope that the committee will accept the proposals of the Minister, which, after all, will merely mean deferring the matter pending the receipt of a report from the Tariff Board. </para></quote><para class="block">Since that date 'the Government has secured a further report from the Tariff Board, the nature of which the Minister has indicated. He has assured the committee also that, in the light of that report, the du'ties proposed in the schedule are fair, and adequate to protect a great Australian industry. The main charge against the Australian Window Glass Company is that it has exploited the public by charging the price of a first class article for glass of an inferior quality. We have definitely proved, not only that that statement is incorrect, but also that' the very opposite is true. The further allegation that the company cannot supply the Australian requirements of glass also is incorrect. Because of the stocks it has on hand and its productive capacity, it is able to supply, not only the present subnormal requirements, but also the full demand when prosperity, which1 we are assured is " just around the corner", re-appears. Tor these reasons, I trust that the duties will be agreed to. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2973</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZD</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">FOLL, Hattil</name><name role="display">Senator FOLL</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold">.- Senator Collings</inline>has stated the case for the Australian Window Glass Company, but I remind' the committee that a company writing its own testimonial would not err on the side of modesty. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2973</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K7P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">COLLINGS, Joseph</name><name role="display">Senator Collings</name></talker><para>-  The Tariff Board's report agrees with what I have said. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2973</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZD</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">FOLL, Hattil</name><name role="display">Senator FOLL</name></talker><para>- Because of what the Tariff Board has- reported, I shall support the item; but it is evident that a change has come over the scene in the last twelve months.

It is admitted that, in August or September last, complaints were not' unjustified ; but production is now proceeding normally, and honorable senators can accept my assurance that the Government is watching the position closely. With the operation of the Ottawa agreement, the deferred duty must eventually come to an end. It is admitted that, on two occasions - due, I understand, to mishaps to machinery - the company was unable to fulfil orders ; but I am advised that production is now on a permanent and satisfactory basis. The Tariff Board will again investigate  the position. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> desired to know if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irwin</inline> accompanied the departmental experts on the occasion of their last visit to the factory. Bie did not, because he is not an officer of the department, and the visit was purely a departmental one. It completely satisfied those who, prior to the departure of the former Minister for Trade and Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Gullett, for' Ottawa, were not satisfied. Although the company did, at one stage, import sheet glass, its importations were not of the huge dimensions suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll.</inline> Other persons or firms, which had resolved to get into thu business as well, did import heavily; in the belief, probably, that the Australian company would be unable to fulfil its orders. In the transition period between August or September last, and February of i.hi3 year, the company, I am informed, has overcome its difficulties, and is now producing good quality glass in sufficient quantities at prices that compare more than favorably with the prices charged for glass in New Zealand. I therefore ask honorable senators to support the item. If anything should happen to this Australian industry, which even its critics now admit is being conducted efficiently, 240 employees engaged in this branch of the company's operations will lose their employment. . So long as the company is treating purchasers of glass fairly, we should not act hastily to interfere with the duties. Some of the things that have been said about the company may or may not have been true ; but no one will deny that this industry is of some importance to Australia, and I venture to predict that, if it is not supported, and if, as a consequence, the company discontinues this branch of its operations, users of glass in Australia will not obtain their requirements at present prices. Shortly after his appointment to the Ministry, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(.Mr. White),</inline> .accompanied by departmental officers, inspected the works, in order to satisfy himself about the manner in which the manufacture is being carried on. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2974</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator REID</name></talker><para>.- As one who has watched the progress of this new industry in Australia, I have to admit that, while ite product was at first somewhat crude, it is now satisfactory as to quality.

There was a full dress debate on it when we were validating the Scullin tariff, and I have heard nothing new in the debate which has taken place to-day. I intend to vote for these duties, but I desire to enter a protest against the manner in which this company is treating its employees. Unfortunately, we are in such a position that, while we can talk about new protection, we cannot enforce it. We may vote for duties which will help the manufacturers while they are organizing to defeat us, not only politically, but industrially also. We may feel hostile to the manufacturers, but, as the lesser of two evils, we must vote to protect their industry. At the present time, the manufacturers are talking of imposing a levy in order to raise a fund to fight Labour at the next election. At the same time, they invoke the assistance of the Labour party to enable them to make profits out of the community, while attacking the interests of the most necessary class in the community. Of course, when we merely protest and still vote for the. duties, the manufacturers have the laugh on us. Any government worthy of its position should take up this stand: If the Constitution prevents it from stipulating how the consumers on the one hand, and the employees on the other, must be treated, it should lay it down that those manufacturers who fail to do the fair thing by the public and by their employees should have their tariff protection withdrawn immediately. In such a case, I should be prepared to repeal a duty on the spot, without giving the offending firms a moment's consideration. I have read much of the propaganda, literature issued by the Australian Glass Manufacturing Company, and have also heard the criticism directed against the company. Much of the adverse criticism comes from those who have failed to recognize the progress made by the company within very recent times. It has spent a great deal of money on improving its equipment, and is now in a better position to fulfil public needs than it was a little while ago. </para></talk.start><para>If the Labour party gets into power again,  1  hope that the Government will insist that those manufacturers who are reaping profits as the result of a high tariff shall refrain from exploiting the public by charging unduly high prices, and shall treat their employees properly. If they commit either of these faults, or attempt to do so, the protection should be removed at once. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> said, if we must have a monopoly, it is better to have one in our own country, where we may exercise some supervision over it, than to be at the mercy of one oversea, which we have no way of controlling.

One of the conditions of protection should be that the law of the land is observed in regard to labour awards and working conditions. The glass, manufacturers say that they cannot sell glass more cheaply, because they are compelled to  recognize  Australia's working standard. "We have been inundated with literature from the company, and one of the arguments used before the Tariff Board was that the company could not compete with the manufacturers of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and even Great Britain, because, in those countries, wages were so much lower than here. It was necessary for them, they said, to receive a higher price for their product in order to be able to pay the higher wages. I do not object to the manufacturers receiving a fair price, but when they receive it, they should do the fair thing by their employees, and observe the awards. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that the Labour party has been a stalking horse for the manufacturers.

We are told that this industry cannot prosper unless it receives a thumping high duty of 75 per cent., which is to become operative in February next. T suppose that there is hardly any standard by which we can measure the ambitions of some in the matter of customs duties. A duty of 25 per cent, was once considered fair, but now duties of 35 per cent., 45 per cent., and 55 per cent, are imposed, and, apparently, maximum rates have not yet been reached. It is ridiculous to ask this Parliament to believe that an Australian industry cannot survive unless it receives tariff pro,tection of 75 per  cent.,  plus other substantial benefits, which may represent another 75 per cent. We are told that the Australian glass industry cannot carry on successfully unless we are prepared to pay this price. Recalling the excuses put forward in support of local industries, I find that they are of an extraordinarily diversified, order. In the first place, high duties are recommended' to- assist what are- termed' languishing: industries. In a commercial sense, a languishing industry is one which is unprofitable to those engaged in it; but, judging by the experience of this particular company, I do not think that it can be said to be languishing. As there are not many other Australian companies that are paying so well, it cannot be included in that category. It is paying a high rate of dividend on the capital invested, and placing a fairly large sum to reserves even in bad times. In these circumstances, it is not entitled to a high protective duty. "We are also told from time to time that this and other Australian industries are being slashed. That term was extensively used prior to the last general election, and was to be seen on numerous hoardings in Melbourne. Can it be said that this industry is being " slashed " when the glass it produces is protected by a duty of 2s. or 4s. per 100 square feet, when an embargo is imposed on importations, and on top of all, the rationing system is introduced? Where does the " slashing " come in? What application can such a term have in this instance? The glass industry has three separate coats of mail. It is protected by high duties, an embargo, and the rationing process, which enables it to obtain its own prices. Every citizen is supposed to stand equal before the law. I direct <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings'</inline> attention to the fact that while this and other Australian industries are protected in this way, another important Australian, industry does not enjoy any protection at all. Its products are sold in open competition in the markets of the world. The glassmanufacturing industry, having three - distinct and effective forms of protection, is 'producing goods at an artificial price. Equality before the law! Where does the equality come in ? It is a sham and a farce to say that there is equality before the law when one industry receives protection in three forms, while the wheat, wool, butter, and other primary industries, which, unlike this industry, are of vital importance to the Commonwealth, do not receive any. Is that fair play? Australian producers, who have been selling large quantities of their products in the European markets, will not have a dog's chance, because of the damage being done by this Parliament. Australian producers wish to dispose of 150,000,000 bushels of wheat and 2,800,000 'bales of wool in foreign markets, but when the foreigner realizes how we are treating them under this and other items in the tariff, what chance will we have of profitably disposing of these products? Our action in this and other matters will have a repercussive effect, resulting in such decreased markets and lower prices, that our wheat and wool producers will find their work so unprofitable that they will be forced to leave their holdings. Should that occur, the unemployed situation will be more acute than it has ever been. </para></talk.start><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline>informed the committee that the quantity of plain sheet glass used in the average dwelling-house is so small that it is not worth considering. The action we are taking will centre attention upon us, and show that, in framing tariffs, we do not know what we are doing. As a nation we could not pay our way, and as individuals we could not sustain our bodily strength but for the wheat and other primary products we produce. Quite recently the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> said that . the rural producers are the backbone of this country. Without a vestige of protection they are producing goods for export which enable us to meet our overseas commitments. Why should we do anything which tends to diminish our sales of wheat and wool? We are. increasing the burdens, of our rural producers, and discouraging land settlement. This protection mania, which commenced 25 years ago, may go even further; but at last there are signs that it has reachedthe limit. The glass-making industry commenced operations with a duty of 25 per cent., but duties, like the bids of an auctioneer in a sale-yard, are continually going up. Is it not time to call a halt ? We cannot play ducks and drakes with duties in this way without others doing the same. This company, like many others, should be satisfied with' paying dividends of 4 per cent, or 5 per cent., and in these bad times should not ask for high, duties. Many companies are not making any profits at all. Are the primary producers making any profits? They have incurred serious losses, which increase every time they set the plough in motion. We should reduce, rather than increase, the cost of production. The quantity  of  plain clear glass used in an average dwelling may be small, but it is the accumulation of what may appear small items that burden primary producers, and increase their producing costs. The <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Year-Booh</inline> shows how the cost of production has increased. </para><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2978</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>- The honorable senator has exhausted his time. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2978</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K09</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PAYNE, Herbert</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name></talker><para>.- I suppose that there is no industry in Australia which has been discussed more than the Australian  glass  industry.

It is understood that the company did not increase, its price to the same extent as did other merchants. There is no doubt that the action of the Scullin Government was responsible for the increase. The <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette</inline> had notified the further deferment of the duty until August or September of that year. Without withdrawing that notification, the Scullin Government, by resolution, brought the duty into operation, although no window glass of reasonable quality was being produced by the company at the time. The law provides that, when the Tariff Board reports to the Minister that an article of reasonable quality, and in sufficient quantity to provide for the probable requirements of the people, is being produced, the Minister may, by proclamation or resolution, lift the deferment of the duty. That stipulation was not observed. I have not risen to oppose the company; I wish to see the industry carried on, but under reasonable conditions. I am hopeful that, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Badman</inline> docs not secure the acceptance of his request, a further request will be moved that I can support. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us look at what this really means. In the first place, it must he remembered that the whole of the glass business of this country  wa3  very seriously interfered with by the lifting of the deferment of the duty before glass was manufactured  here.  At that time, it was difficult to obtain supplies of glass. The statements in regard to the quality of the glass first produced by the company are contradictory.  The  company ought to have known very well that it could not expect to produce suitable glass at the first attempt. I am prepared to accept its statement that the quality is now more satisfactory than it was last year, when even a layman could detect the difference between the local and the imported article. It must be recognized that glass is absolutely essential to the people of Australia, even in connexion with the construction of cottages, despite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid's</inline> suggestion that clear glass is gradually being used to a less a.nd less extent in such buildings. It will be a long time before the Australian people consent to have opaque windows in their houses. I believe that there will always be a considerable demand for clear glass by some of our primary producers. I know very well how the tomato-growers were handicapped when the price of clear glass was enormously increased by the excessively high duties  that  were imposed contrary -to the law of the land. I trust that when this matter is settled, the Government will stick to its guns, and that we may regard it  as  having been decided for a reasonably lengthy period. I should like to know  why the matter has been so frequently referred to the Tariff Board. The report of the board dated August, 1932, recommended a flat rate of 2s. and 4s., and a deferred duty of 40 per cent, and 60 per cent. In January of this year, the board made a further report, in which it slightly altered its previous recommendation, and now we are told that the matter is again to be referred to it. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2979</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K3L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SAMPSON, Burford</name><name role="display">Senator Sampson</name></talker><para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> says that if the last recommendation of the board i3 adopted, he will be ruined. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2979</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K09</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PAYNE, Herbert</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold">- Mr. Smith</inline>has stilted definitely in some of his letters that unless he is given a prohibitive duty, he cannot carry on.

It is on that particular aspect of the matter that the Government desires the board to report.

The board has been asked to say whether it adheres to its recommendation, which meanwhile is being given effect. The duty can be further deferred if the board reports that the company i3 not producing glass of satisfactory quality, or that it is being produced satisfactorily at the moment, but that those conditions may not continue. I understand that the production is now continuously satisfactory. The Minister himself saw what was being done, but preferred to be fortified on the question of permanence. I wish to be perfectly just to the industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> will recollect that on two occasions, this company produced a good article, and that subsequently, its methods failed.

The telegram which I read earlier this afternoon was dated the 23rd June, 1933, and I challenge the honorable senator, to disprove the statements contained therein. There is no doubt that the Australian Glass Manufacturing Company is a wealthy concern which, as honorable senators opposite know, has endeavoured to exploit both its employees and the general public. It is significant that honorable senators opposite are now beginning to see the tariff in the light shed upon it by the leading article in the <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily</inline> of the 8th July - a light in which many of us have regarded it for a long time. They appear to realize at last that high duties may enable Australian  manufacturers to exploit the public. I quote the following extract from the leading article referred to - . </para></talk.start><para>It has been obvious for a long time that employers have taken advantage of Labour's wholesale high tariff policy to build up a protective wall behind which they can extract excessive profits from the public and drive their employees at the lowest rates that can be- wangled from friendly courts, while at the same time using .portion of the profits so obtained- to destroy the ' Labour Governments when the desired benefits have been obtained, and to smash the Labour movement. . . . The timehas arrived, and it cannot be too much emphasized, when the manufacturers must learn that they cannot have it both ways. If Labourhas been the clown of the Australian political circus, even a clown sometimes learns to laugh at himself. And the Australian Labour movement is laughing at itself now - but laughing bitterly. </para><para class="block">Some particulars concerning this company, taken from its published balance-sheets,; may be of interest to honorable senators. From 1923 to 1933 it paid a dividend of 9 per cent, on its preference shares - evidently the £1 shares of those who were fortunate enough to get in on the ground floor. Its ordinary shares paid a dividend of 10 per cent, from . 1923 to 1928, and in the two succeeding years 12½ per cent. Even in 1931, the worst year of the depression, the company's ordinary shares paid a dividend of 6 per cent. In 1932 the dividend rose to 7½ per cent, with a further  rise to 9 per cent, in 1933. The paid-up capital of the Australian Glass Manufacturing Company Limited, of which Australian Window Glass Proprietary Limited is a subsidiary company, was £950,695in 1924; in 1933, it was £1,105,478. Its cash investments in 1933 amounted to £608,769, and its nominal reserves to £506,087.I take it that that money has come from the Australian purchasers of glass sold by the company. </para><para>There have been numerous complaints regarding the Australian company's inability to meet orders from the trade. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harvey,</inline> of Clarkson's Limited, Adelaide, informed the Tariff Board that, in order to test the quality of Australian glass, his company had given. Australian Window Glass Proprietary Limited an order for 112 cases of sheet glass on the 2nd November, 1931. That glass was delivered as follows: - Five cases on the 17th June, 1932; 21 cases on the 20th June; 30 eases on the 30th June; 43 cases on the 11th August; 10 cases on the 19th August, and the balance on the 8th September. The last consignment was delivered nearly ten months after the order had been placed. ' There is no justification for protecting a company which has inflicted suffering on the general public by charging unduly high prices for glass. Listening to honorable senators opposite, one might think that the Tariff Board existed merely for the purpose of assisting Australian manufacturing industries, and was not concerned with the interests of the Australian public. It is time that the interests of the consumers were considered. It has been said that because the Australian company paid £80,000 to the Belgian owners of certain patents, it is entitled to protection.

While I am anxious to see the ad valorem duty retained, I also desire to ensure that it will not be unnecessarily heavy. The rates proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Badman</inline> should give ample protection to the Australian industry, for a British ad valorem rate of 30 per cent, really represents an 80 per cent, protection when a 25 per cent, exchange, 10 per cent, primage, and a transportation cost amounting to 12½ per cent, are taken into consideration. The difficulties that have been experienced in the past should help the Australian Window Glass Proprietary Limited materially in the future to manufacture a suitable article at a reduced price. Glass is used extensively throughout Australia, and any action that would tend to interfere with general trade, and increase prices, would act prejudicially on the community as a whole. I believe that rationing of imports is most unwise, because it is impracticable, and prevents that freedom of business operation which is so desirable. While the department might adopt methods which it considered suitable, it would find, in practice, that they were most unsuitable. Only those who are handling glass and supplying the market can understand the proportions in which the various sizes and gauges should be imported. We have had the experience that, when a total embargo was first placed on the importation of glass, prices immediately increased. As soon as the embargo was removed, and entry was granted to a certain quantity of glass, prices dropped; then, when the embargo was re-imposed, prices again went up. The dislocation of trade that ensued must be prejudicial to our commercial life, and must react adversely upon those who have to buy sheet glass. For that reason I support the request, and I hope that the Minister will consider not only the removal of the embargo on the importation of glass, but also the practice of rationing. </para></talk.start><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae)</inline> negatived - </para><quote><para>That the question be now put. </para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2984</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KTR</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>UAP</party><role>Vice-President of the Executive Council</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCLACHLAN, Alexander</name><name role="display">Senator McLACHLAN</name></talker><para>. -  It is not the wish of the Government, nor of myself, to stifle discussion in any way.

The Government is not engaging in any process of rationing, as there are sufficient supplies of glass in Australia to meet all requirements, and, while that condition exists, the prohibition will remain in force. The department has come to the conclusion, that, while it is easy enough to ration such commodities while in bond, it is impracticable to ration importations. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2984</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K3L</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SAMPSON, Burford</name><name role="display">Senator SAMPSON</name></talker><para>. - I shall support the request that has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Badman.</inline> I con fess that I envy theself  -confidence  and self-complacency of my very good friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> who speaks invariably with a sublime authority.

Some years ago I inspected the Ulam Carrara marble quarries in the Rockhampton district, and I was amazed at its beauty. The marble is pure and white, and for durability is first-class, if not equal to the best Italian Carrara. It has been used in a war memorial at a place about 30 miles from Rockhampton, for marble steps for the Rockhampton School of Arts, for a hotel bar in Sydney, and also for a well-known cafe bar, and in every instance the marble has given complete satisfaction. In 1929, before the advent of the Scullin Government, I was told that, with sufficient tariff protection, this industry could capture the Australian market. Unfortunately, the depression arose, and, no doubt, the company operating in Queensland found it impossible to extend its operations at that time. This is a small industry, but still it is worth encouraging, since, according to the old saying " Mony a pickle makes a muckle ". It seems strange that a country like Australia, of nearly 3,000,000 square miles, has to import stone of any kind. In addition to the Ulam Carrara marble, there are good deposits at Gladstone, Queensland, and in certain parts of New South Wales. Although Italian marble has almost a monopoly of the trade, Queensland marble to the value of £12,456 has been marketed. It is ridiculous to import stone, wrought or unwrought, when Australia produces every variety, of stone to granite and marble. We must protect the hundreds of small industries as well as the large ones. </para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator MCLACHLAN</inline>(South Australia - Vice-President of the Executive be read in conjunction with the other subitems of item 262, dealt with in group 4. Stone in the rough, n.e.i., is admitted free under the British tariff, and is subject to a duty of 10 per cent, in the general tariff. The proposal to admit free white marble, unwrought, for monumental and switchboard purposes is in accordance with the recommendation of the Tariff Board, which inquired into this item in 1930. The importations of unwrought marble, including rough or scabbled from the pick, were valued at £1,021 in 1928- 29 ; £1,710 in 1929-30 ; £544 in 1930-31 ; £803 in 1931-32 ; and £1,210 in 1932-33. The evidence obtained by the board showed that Australian white marble blocks can be purchased in any of the capital cities at prices lower than the landed duty paid costs of Italian marble blocks. Imported slabs, however, can be landed at a cost lower than that at which the Australian slabs can be delivered, but if blocks are purchased from the quarries, they can be cut into slabs in the monumental yards at a cost which makes them cheaper than imported marble. The board was satisfied that if prices were the only factor in the competition, Australian white marble could easily capture the market. Marble is used in Australia principally for monumental work, switchboards, and the interiors of buildings. The evidence showed that Australian quarries can provide the whole of the marble required for interior building purposes, but the local white marble possesses characteristics which render it unsuitable for monumental purposes and the making of switchboards. For monumental work, the texture must be crystalline fine and uniform in grain size. It would appear that the marble from Queensland and South Australia, which are the main sources of supply of the Australian product, is too friable, and the uses to which it may be put are definitely limited. Even in many cases in which it can he used, the marble has to be worked in a special and more expensive way to produce satisfactory results. .The white marble obtainable from the Newbridge quarries in New South Wales is considered by the trade to be quite satisfactory for monumental work, but the supplies are limited. Australian white marble, by reason of the metal impurities it contains, is unsuitable for the manufacture of switchboards. </para><para class="block">Another objection is that its coarse texture renders it unsatisfactory because great precision in drilling switchboards is necessary. About 80 per cent, of the marble imported in the past has been used for monumental work and switchboards, for which purposes Australian white marble, generally speaking, is unsuitable. The board was of opinion that if the highest duty asked for were granted, very little of the white marble imported would be replaced by Australian marble. In respect of all classes of Australian stone and marble which can be used satisfactorily, the board has taken good cars of the local industry. </para><para>Sub-items agreed to. </para><para>Division 10. -DRUGS and Chemicals. </para><para>Item 273- </para><quote><para>Carbide ofcalcium, per lb., British,1d.; general, 2d. </para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2987</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JRT</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">COX, Charles</name><name role="display">Senator COX</name></talker><para>.- I move- </para></talk.start><quote><para>That the House of Representatives he requested to make the duty, British, free. </para></quote><para class="block">Under the 1921 tariff, the duty on British carbide was £4 a ton, and on foreign, £7 10s. With this protection, the industry was carried on successfully, almost three-fourths of our requirements being supplied by a company operating in Tasmania. In 1926, the Tariff Board recommended against an increase of the protection. In addition to those duties, the industry was further protected by gazettals under the Customs Tariff Industries Preservation Act, which prevented carbide from being imported at prices lower than £18 10s.1d. a ton c.i.f. Adding a duty of £7 10s., the landed cost amounted to £26 0s.1d., which was higher than the prices charged by the local industry c.i.f. at main Australian ports. The board considered in 1926 that under the existing duties, plus the protection afforded by the Industries Preservation Act, the whole of the Australian market would eventually be secured to the local manufacturers. The duty was sub1 sequently increased to £28 a ton. This schedule proposes a duty of £18 13s. 4d., but even this is an increase of over 160 per cent, on the 1921-30 duty. A feature of the Canadian Trade Agreement was a concession to the dominion in respect of this commodity, but Canada has been unable to benefit on account of the high rate of duty imposed by the Commonwealth. If primage and exchange also are taken into consideration, the proposed rates are prohibitive. The prices of the Australian product range from £23 7s. to £25 10s. a ton. Carbide is sold in Norway at' £14 13s. 5d. a ton f.o.b., whilst Canadian carbide is quoted at £12 a ton f.o.b. This industry in Australia is a monopoly. There is no competition at present, and on account of the prohibitive duties there can be none in the future. The industry will be able to exploit the public, and as the principal users are men on the land who use acetylene gas plants, and poor working men who ride bicycles, the increase of duty is entirely indefensible. The small farmers are dependent on acetylene lighting, and carbide has to -be carried great distances to them. These people are the real pioneers, and should be helped and encouraged. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> who has taken a prominent part in the debate on these tariff items, and has moved many requests for lower duties, should, to play the game, support this requested amendment. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2987</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KTR</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>UAP</party><role>Vice-President of the Executive Council</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCLACHLAN, Alexander</name><name role="display">Senator McLACHLAN</name></talker><para>. - I cannot accept the honorable senator's request.

It would, perhaps, have come better from him if it had related to some industry in which New South Wales was concerned, also if he had earlier considered the inter-action of the tariff as a whole, and the effect of high duties, not only on those who live in the back-blocks of New South "Wales, or any other State, but also on the Empire overseas, and the world at large. But I am afraid that, even if his request were carried, it would not make the slightest difference, because our imports from British countries and Norway this year were nil, and from other foreign countries only £47 in value. Last year we imported from British countries carbide to the value of £423, from Norway £1,051 worth, and from other foreign countries £375 worth, so it is perfectly obvious that the honorable senator's request is more aimed, I suggest, at his colleagues from Tasmania than designed to help those unfortunate people who have to use carbide. But I shall support the honorable gentleman, provided he stands up to his arguments in support of it, and. provided, also, that he receives the Government's permission to proceed with it. It may, after all, be a belated repentance for his attitude with regard to the duties on sheet glass. I happen to know something about carbide, because, for many years, I have used considerable quantities of it. I regretted exceedingly when it became impossible to procure the Norwegian article, which was very good. For a considerable time the Australian carbide was not so good. It was dusty, and, with the particular apparatus which I was using, it was not quite satisfactory. But, by way of rebuttal of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> has said about it, I should add that the Australian industry has definitely improved during the last ten years.

Since then the position has become more acute, because of the alteration of the exchange position. "We can claim for the carbide industry what could not be claimed for the glass industry, which we were discussing a little while ago, that it has never increased it's prices.  When-   ever possible, it has reduced prices, while always maintaining the quality of its product. Shortly after the company was inaugurated, the price of carbide was £80 a ton. The company gave an undertaking to keep its price in the vicinity of £26 a ton, and at the present time it is, I believe, as low as £24. It cannot, therefore, be said that the manufacturers are exploiting the public. The industry is worth about £100,000 a year to Tasmania, and, with the exception of a small quantity of anthracite coal imported from Wales, all the raw material, including limestone, steel sheets, timber for casks, fuel, &amp;c, is obtained in Tasmania. The company is also a very large consumer of electric power produced at the hydroelectric works operated by the Tasmanian Government. Since the present' protection became effective in June, 1930, users have paid less for carbide. than at any time since the war. In the report of the Tariff Board, it was stated - </para><quote><para>Since the present company has been in operation all carbide that has left the works for the general market has at least equalled the British acetylene standard gas yield (300 litres per kilo), and for the last three years nothing has been shipped of a quality less than 310 litres per kilo - the weekly average being over 315 litres per kilo, which is 5 per cent, in excess of the amount required by the British standard. </para></quote><para class="block">That, I think, answers <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> in regard to the quality of the product. I think he admitted that the quality 'has recently been satisfactory, though, at first, he said it' was not equal to the best Norwegian carbide. The price charged for carbide ' in Australia is approximately the same as that paid in other parts of the world, while the quality is' equal if -not superior to that of carbide supplied to users elsewhere. When applying for the duty to be raised to 2d. per lb., the company gave an undertaking not to increase the price above the then ruling price of £26 a ton. The company has proved its bona fides by charging less than the stipulated amount, the average price being a little over £24 a ton. The company is being run. on sound commercial lines, and is not out to exploit the public. Since it has been in operation, it has never yet paid a dividend. The first company lost the whole of it's capital, and the enterprise has now been run for some years by an English company having many Australian shareholders, which, as -I have said, has not returned, to its shareholders a penny on the capital subscribed.

I can understand the sympathy which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> has with the Australian users of carbide, and, how anxious he is that their living costs should be reduced. The honorable senator is keenly desirous of reducing the cost of living to the Australian farmers who use carbide, and possibly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> will support the request for a reduction of the rates. I am rather inclined to favour the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant.</inline> There appears to be a split in the Tasmanian camp, but of that we may hear more later.

According to the evidence given before the Tariff Board  -  I take it that the witnesses before that tribunal are honest and prudent - prior to the establishment of this industry in Tasmania carbide was selling at £80 a ton, but immediately on the establishment of the local industry, the price fell by about 50 per cent. Those controlling  the Tasmanian carbide industry are to be congratulated upon placing carbide on the Australian market at one-half the price previously ruling. This shows that in Australia, where the cost of  labour is comparatively high, we have been able to market a commodity at a price which is lower than that at which it is produced in countries where labour is. much less costly than it is in Australia. Since the, establishment of the local industry there has been a gradual reduction of price. In support of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has said, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peacock,</inline> on behalf of the Australian Commonwealth Carbide Company, alleged that overseas carbide manufacturers, including those in the United States of America, and in Canada, had formed an international carbide ring, and fixed the price at rates to prevent competition.

It came under the board's notice that the price quoted to Australian buyers are substantially below the domestic price in the countries of export. For instance, Canadian carbide is sold to Australian purchasers at £12 per ton f.o.b., whereas the price on the Canadian home market ranges from £20 16s. 9d. to £22 8s. lOd. Again, Norwegian carbide is .exported to. Australia at £14 13s. 5d. per ton f.o.b., but it waa ascertained that the domestic price of Norwegian carbide recently imported into New Zealand was £21 10s. 4d. a ton. That was clear evidence of what was taking place in the matter of selling prices in two countries. Compared with the market prices for overseas carbide in the country of export, the prices charged by the Australian manufacturers at present are reasonable, and are much below the price at which overseas carbide could be landed free of duty in Australia under present exchange conditions. The Australian manufacturer's present selling prices c.i.f. and e. capital cities are for 5-ton lots, £25 4s. lid., and for larger parcels, £23 7s. Id. The board shows conclusively that the industry can function successfully under the rates of duty proposed. The Government, of course, has in mind that there is only one manufacturer of carbide in Australia, and cannot overlook the fact that a monopoly in the industry may be harassing to the purchasing public as it may result in prices being charged on a much higher scale than if competition existed. Under the proposed rates, with normal exchange and no primage, Canadian carbide would be landed in Australia at £25 12s. 5d. a ton, and Norwegian carbide at £37 5s. lOd. a ton, compared with the Australian manufacturer's selling prices of £25 4s. lid. for 5-ton lots and £23 7s. Id. for larger parcels. The rates that the committee is asked to adopt will adequately protect the local manufacturer and, at the same time, under normal exchange conditions, ensure the safeguarding of the interests of the purchasing public by establishing a maximum price level for Australian carbide. Carbide is one of the items included in the Canadian Trade Agreement. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox's</inline> request were agreed to, the Australian producer would not be able to carry on. If, on the other hand, the duty were increased beyond the rate recommended by the Tariff Board, the protection given would be greater than that which the board has demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt is sufficient. The industry employs a considerable volume of labour, more than 200 persons being engaged in it. It uses a lot of Australian products, and absorbs a good deal of electric power. A greater measure of protection would result in monopolization, of which there could be no corrective, and which would exercise a disturbing influence on the Canadian Trade Agreement, while less protection would expose the. industry to the chill winds of Canadian imports, and ultimately crush it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> said that the company had never declared a dividend. It is for, the company itself to decide whether it should carry on in those circumstances. The recommendation of the Tariff Board was made after the most searching investigation, and the object of the board was to give the industry a fair deal. That also is what the Government stands for; no more, and no less. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2993</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KOF</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HAYES, John</name><name role="display">Senator J B HAYES</name></talker><para>. - My colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Grant)</inline> has stated the case so fully and clearly that there is not much left for me to say; but there arc one or two points that I should like to make. I do not believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> is serious in his request, and I hope that he will withdraw it. This industry has been in a struggling condition ever since it commenced to operate during the war years. The carbide that it produces is made to a standard, is of excellent quality, and is cheap. When it was initiated, the price of carbide was £80 a ton, but it dropped immediately to £40 a ton. I remember distinctly that for some time while this company was supplying carbide in Australia for £27 10s. a ton, the price in South Africa was £50 a ton, and in New Zealand £45 a ton. Surely, then, it deserves some recognition! The company which inaugurated the hydroelectric scheme in Tasmania started this enterprise, but lost all the capital invested. I do not know what electric power is being used by the present company, but the first contract made with the Tasmanian Government some years ago was for 3,500 horse-power continuously. This industry is a necessary adjunct to the hydro-electric scheme, and that is the reason for its having been started in Tasmania. I recollect that the original company could not obtain the formula that would enable it to make the electrodes which are necessary in the manufacture of carbide, because the secret of their manufacture, was held in enemy countries, and the knowledge was not gained until many months had been" devoted to research and experimental work of a most exacting character. Then, as soon .as a satisfactory result was obtained the plant used for their manufacture was burnt down. Other diffi- culties  have been encountered year after year, and no dividends have yet been paid. The present company cannot carry on without this small duty. Owing to the exchange position making it easier for Canada to export, I am sure that a duty of 2d. per lb. British is needed. -I cannot find in the schedule many items that have been reduced, and I do not consider that it is fair to lower by 50 per cent, the protection afforded to a key industry. This industry ought to enjoy the Australian trade. When my attention was first" drawn to the reduction of 50 per cent., I thought that it must be a mistake. I still think so, and I shall help to restore the rate to a reasonable level. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2993</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRZ</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LYNCH, Patrick</name><name role="display">Senator LYNCH</name></talker><para>. - It is worth while recording that, comparatively speaking, Tasmania has suffered to a greater extent than any other State in consequence of its having entered the federal system. That is admitted on all hands. Therefore, when an industry of this description asks to be shown some sympathy, my old friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox,</inline> cannot be serious when he suggests that we should abolish the duty and thus, at one stroke, wipe it out of existence. If those who are running the glass industry conducted their business on the same lines as are followed by the carbide industry, no fault could be found with them. The trouble under the operation of the tariff is that one set of people can do a lot of things which are not open to another set to do. This carbide enterprise is rendering a good service to Australia if it succeeds in attracting capital to this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacDonald</inline> referred to the fact that the company is registered in London, and that some of the capital came from there. What is wrong with that? I regard it as a most commendable feature, if only because it serves to show that there are, in the distance, people who are willing to trust us to the extent of investing their savings in our industries in the belief that they will get a fair deal. This industry is entitled to special consideration on that ground alone.  The reason that it was established in Tasmania is that it was able to obtain there cheaper power than is available in any other State of the Commonwealth. If an industry started under  such favorable auspices has found it hard to continue, and has not paid a penny by way of dividend, "what would have happened had it had the same environment as the glass industry in Sydney? It would have been hopelessly bankrupt, and would not be appealing to this Parliament for assistance. Therefore, a great deal of credit is due to the company for having carried on and given the users of this commodity a fair deal. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2994</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JVF</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DOOLEY, John</name><name role="display">Senator Dooley</name></talker><para>-  The same thing applies to the gold-mining industry in Western Australia. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2994</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LYNCH, Patrick</name><name role="display">Senator LYNCH</name></talker><para>- Because Western Australia had not a free market for its gold during the war period, it lost more than would have paid the gold bounty ten times over. This case presents a feature of our tariff legislation that is too often lost sight of. If the argument is true that the essence of protection is that we must protect ourselves against those who are on a lower plane than we are, socially, industrially and economically, no protection should be needed against Canada, because its standards are not inferior to ours. When we seek to protect ourselves against those who enjoy equal social standards, we expose the utter fallacy of a large part of our tariff policy. We protect a local industry against Massey-Harris machinery, yet it still comes in; and we cannot prevent it from doing so, because those who make these implements in Canada are standing up to their job, while the Australian workmen and manufacturers are not doing so. We cannot con-, tinue to build this high tariff wall against people who are in no respect inferior to  u3,  because to do so would be a confession of incompetence, and an inability to stand up to our job. Are we not the equals in every respect of the people of those countries which observe the same conditions of living and civilized life as ourselves. Then, why the necessity for our high tariff barrier, unless we are the dupes of the party that believes that high tariffs alone are needed to bring about prosperity? If this barrier is required, it must be maintained at the expense of the unfortunate section who toil on the land, and whose backs are now almost broken. We should ask ourselves why we cannot stand up to our duties, the same as countries like Canada, the United States of America and New Zealand. I support these duties in the belief that the Tasmanian carbide industry needs assistance, and if every other industry in Australia that enjoys protection had behaved in the same way as has the carbide industry, the charge against protection would be shorn of its ugliest features. Many of those who are sheltered by the tariff wall are fleecing the people to an unwarranted extent, an( the people on the land feel hurt when, they find that favours are shovelled out to one section of the community at the expense of another. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2994</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JRW</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CRAWFORD, Thomas</name><name role="display">Senator CRAWFORD</name></talker><para>.  -  I have listened with a good  deal  of indignation to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> entirely unjustified vilification of Australia and Australians.

In Denmark, the krone has depreciated a great deal, and a remarkable feature of the economic reviews received from London is that they show that Scandinavia is using Denmark as a buttress for the purpose of dumping products on the British markets. When the ex-member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> visited Canada on behalf of the last Labour Government - I admit that he did good work in connexion with the trade mission which he conducted - it was desired that Australia should increase its trade with Canada in dried fruits, canned pineapples, other canned fruits, rabbit skins, butter and citrus fruits; but our trade agreement with Canada has been nullified by the Ottawa agreement. As Canada is now entitled to export carbide to Australia under the British preferen tial rate, I feel that that rate should be increased to 3d. per lb. Directly and indirectly, the manufacture of carbide of calcium at the company's works at Electrona, about 27 miles from Hobart, gives employment to over 200 men. With the exception of about 4,000 tons of Welsh coal, an essential requirement which has to be imported, all the raw materials are obtainable in Tasmania. A higher British preferential tariff would give added protection to this Australian industry. At this juncture we have little need to fear competition from Germany, because that  nation  is fully occupied in dealing with' its interna] troubles. The French Chamber of Deputies, of about 500 members, recently raised the tariff against goods from the United States of America by about 100 per cent., in retaliation against that country's manipulation of the dollar. Just as the Scandinavian producers of carbide operate through Denmark, so the producers of this material in the United States of America work through the British dominion  of  Canada. By establishing their factories in Canadian territory they get the benefit of the British preferential rates in our tariff. In the matter of Empire preference, Canadian manufac:turers are on the same footing as those in Tasmania; and, since there is no natural boundary separating the United States of America from  Canada, and because the industrial conditions in the two countries differ greatly, a British preferential duty of 3d. per lb., and a general duty of 6d. per lb., is only reasonable. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> had his way, the money in circulation in Australia would be reduced by £40,392. Statistics show that a worker in receipt of £4  153.  or £5 a week receives sufficient only to meet his needs from pay-day on Friday or Saturday of one week until Tuesday or Wednes-- day of the following week. </para><para>Carbide of calcium manufactured in the United States of America was quoted ' at £25 13s. 4'd. a ton when that country was on the gold standard; but its value to-day, with a goods standard in operation, is difficult to determine. Canada and the United States of America, like Australia, are now off the gold standard, so that national frontiers are ineffective  as a moans of preventing dumping. In view of the happenings at the World Economic Conference in London, Australia will have to follow the example of other countries, which have met the situation confronting them by depreciating their currency.

The Tariff Board states that the manufacture of elastic in Australia commenced in September, 1931. At that time it was free of ordinary customs duty from all countries. The manufacturers hoped to be able to manufacture under the protection of the exchange, and did not apply for a duty. After the industry had been established some little time, the selling prices of both British and Japanese imported elastic were substantially reduced. An application was then submitted by a local manufacturer for the imposition of a duty. The board recommended rates of duty of 35 per cent. British and 55 per cent, general. It stated that the rates recommended would not enable Australian manufacturers to secure the market in all lines, but that they should provide adequate protection for the lines for which there was a reasonably heavy demand. In making its recommendation, the board applied the principle embodied in the Ottawa agreement. </para></talk.start><para class="block">No one will deny that this industry has been of some benefit to the users. of this commodity in Australia. The capital invested in the enterprise is £66,000, and it gives employment to about 150 persons. Iti evidence before the board, the applicants claimed to be able to supply the whole of Australian requirements in narrow elastic, which are estimated to be in the vicinity of 250,000 gross yards, of an approximate value of £130,000. This firm commenced business without assistance <inline font-style="italic">from the</inline> tariff; but, shortly afterwards, it met with the keenest opposition from importing interests,, with the result that it was obliged to apply to the board for protection.

The proposed rates are substantially lower than those imposed by theprevious Government, but agree with the recommendation of the Tariff Board in its report of the 2nd December, 1932. Australian manufacturers did not enter into bulk production, of black printing ink until 1930, but they are now supplying 98 per cent, of the local demand, and have been able to reduce their prices by 20 per cent. In fact, the present prices are the lowest which have been quoted in Australia for some years, and compare favorably with those previously paid for imported ink. The value of the industry, however, is not great. Seventy-five per cent, of the raw materials are imported, and only a small amount of labour is employed. The board is satisfied that the high rates of duty proposed by the previous Government are not required to protect the industry, and there is a danger that, if maintained, they may result in injury to the consumers at a later date.

After reviewing local and overseas prices, the board was satisfied that they were altogether out of proportion to costs, and that the fixed rates now proposed were adequate to provide ample protection to the industry. Windscreens are extensively manufactured in Australia, those of the better class almost wholly from Australian raw material. Most of the cars now sold in Australia are fitted with windscreens of local manufacture. Owing to the shifting of the demand from the open to the closed type of motor-car body, the demand for windscreens of the type covered by this paragraph is diminishing.

The board was satisfied as to the quality of the local article, and believed that the proposed duties were sufficient to protect the Australian manufacturer. Electric wind-screen wipers are not manufactured locally, but these represent only about 10 per cent, of the requirements, and, as they are competitive with the vacuum wiper, a moderate duty against them is needed. Wipers of foreign origin have been quoted at very low prices, and the board considered that the fixed rate of 6s. each was necessary to protect the local manufacturer against the competition arising from such low-priced wipers. The trade speaks very favorably of the Australian wiper, which is supplied by the manufacturer at a moderate price. It has been exported to New Zealand, where it has competed successfully against the products of the' United Kingdom and the United States of America. The Tariff Board drew attention to the marked disparity that existed between the local manufacturer's price and that which the user has to pay, and suggested that an endeavour should be made to reduce the retail price. Action on these lines has been taken, but the matter has not yet been finalized. It is the responsibility of the Trade and Customs Department to police the tariff in matters such as this. The necessary inspection is now being made with a view to remedying some of the defects to which the honorable senator has referred. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3002</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JY7</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNCAN-HUGHES, John</name><name role="display">Senator DUNCAN-HUGHES</name></talker><para>. - Owing to the speed at which motor cars travel, and the danger of accidents to the occupants of motor vehicles and to others, windscreen wipers should be obtainable at as low a price as possible. Nobody can convince me that a great deal depends upon the local manufacture of this article. It is an insignificant and negligible- item, and the motoring public should not be penalized to such an extent that they will be disinclined to purchase windscreen wipers. Although it is but a small accessory of a motor car, it is of the utmost importance that it should be in general use. It is better that half a dozen persons ' should have their lives saved than that  60 should be provided with employment which would make this article expensive. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3002</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K09</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PAYNE, Herbert</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name></talker><para>. - I draw the attention of the committee to the following evidence by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> I.
