                        <para>-  I ask the Leader of the Senate:  (1)  Is it a  fact  that both the post office and Commonwealth Bank derive their authority as governmental institutions from enactments of the Federal Parliament; (2) Is it a fact  that  under financial emergency legislation, the reduction of salaries of postal employees is twice as great as the reduction applied to employees of the Commonwealth Bank? If so, will the Government give consideration to this matter, with  a  view to ensuring uniformity of sacrifice by  the  employees of these  two  important institutions? </para>

                    <para class="block">Briefly, the purpose of this measure is to provide for a reduction of die number of  the  Justices of the High Court from seven to six. Section 4 of the Judiciary Act provides  that  the High Court shall consist of a Chief Justice and six other justices. At present, the court consists of a Chief Justice and five other justices, and it is considered that that number is sufficient to transact the work of the court, but while the present act remains in force, there will be an unfilled vacancy on the bench. Originally, the High Court consisted of a Chief Justice and two other justices. In 1906 the number of justices was increased from three to five and in 1912 from five to seven. Of that number, one was almost fully occupied in presiding over the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, whilst a second justice also spent a great deal of his time in that court. The full bench of seven justices was assembled only to adjudicate upon Constitutional or other very important matters. The law with respect to the Arbitration Court was altered in 1926, to provide that instead of one or two justices of the High Court, with deputy presidents for the time being, functioning as the Arbitration Court, a separate Arbitration Court should be established consisting in the first instance, of three judges, and later,&#39;  of  four judges. There is, therefore, no longer any need for a justice of the High Court to function in the Arbitration Court. Accordingly, one factor which influenced Parliament in arriving at its decision to increase the number of justices of the High Court has disappeared. As six justices are able to do the work, there is no good reason for leaving a vacancy upon the High Court bench, and it is proposed to alter the law by providing that, in future, the court shall consist of a chief justice with five other justices. </para>

                        <para>.- The opposition of some honorable senators to this measure surprised me. When I was discussing the bill with the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. White),</inline> he assured me that for the time being it would apply only to traction engines, and he pointed out that a firm in Australia was manufacturing a traction  engine of a good type in competition with machines made overseas by mass production methods. Most of the tractors used in Australia in recent years have been made either in the United States of America or Canada. Much of the natural protection formerly enjoyed by the local manufacturers by reason of the high rate of exchange between Australia and the United States of America has disappeared in the last few months. The lower exchange rate is assisting the importers of not only tractors, but also American motor cars, and the trade in British vehicles is being unfavourably affected. This bill has been submitted for the purpose of giving encouragement by way of bounty to the local manufacturers of traction engines. </para>

                    <para>In regard to galvanized iron I was surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> offer opposition to the bill, because when he was speaking on the tariff schedule he freely admitted that, owing to the cost of the raw product and the industrial conditions operating in Australia, the local industry required some form of assistance. He said that he preferred that such help should be given by means of a bounty, the cost of which would be borne by the community generally, rather than by a duty which would have to be paid by the users of the commodity. This bill specifically provides for the payment of a higher bounty in the event of the duty being reduced or removed, and an honorable senator who favours a reduction of the duty should readily assent to the measure because the duty is more likely to be lowered if there is a bounty to take its place. If my fiscal views coincided with those of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> I should welcome the measure, because it makes provision for a form of assistance to the galvanized iron industry which he has advocated in the past. Presumably, he will continue to fight for a reduction of the cost of galvanized iron, and he is more likely to achieve his object by supporting the bounty principle. </para>

                            <para>- I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> would have welcomed this bill with open arms. If we wait ten or even fifty years it will always be necessary for Australia to protect its great iron and steel industry, which is vital to. the well-being of the nation. Although it has been said that the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited is able to get from the Parliament any concessions it desires, we must not overlook the fact that, in the event of war, the works of that company would be the arsenal on which we should have to rely for our main supplies of war material. The Government, acting in the belief that the Pacific will be the theatre of warlike operations, and in response to the insistent demand by the people of this country for increased armaments, is considering proposals more effectively to defend Australia. Surely no one will deny that the first step to that end is the adequate protection of the iron and steel industry at Newcastle, which is the only large undertaking of its kind in the southern hemisphere; to it Great Britain itself will look for the requirements of its fleet when the Singapore base is completed. The Newcastle works are practically a part of the defence arm of Australia, and should receive adequate tariff protection even at some cost to the taxpayers. The Government is fully justified in asking the Senate to pass this bill, the purpose of which is to assure the maintenance and further development of this national industry. On other occasions, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has expressed his approval of the system of bounties for industry instead of protec- tion through the customs. This bill gives him an opportunity to .show his consistency. </para>

                            <para>- I am well aware of that, but if the British duty were reduced, and no other provision existed to assist the Australian industry, it could not carry on. The protection given to it was not imposed in some haphazard fashion. Careful investigation was made of all the circumstances connected with the local industry, and a calculation made of the amount of protection necessary for its development under Australian conditions. But we are not, at the moment, concerned with the amount of protection given to this industry. We are considering a measure to enable future bounty payments to be restored iu the. event of a reduction of the duty, and I make no apology for my support of this measure. Although the State of which I am one of the representatives in this chamber is not directly concerned in the iron and steel industry, I regard it as my duty, and the duty of all other honorable senators, regardless of the States which they represent, to safeguard this national industry, whim, in time of* peace, is necessary for the manufacture of commodities required for the development of this country, and in time of war for the production of commodities essential for its defence. Since the iron and steel industry is part and parcel of our defence system, it would be a. bad day for this country if, lacking adequate protection, it were allowed to languish. </para>

                        <para>. - I oppose the bill. It is unnecessary, because adequate protection is already given to the various by-products of the industry in the tariff schedule which has recently been carried through this chamber by the Government, with the assistance of Labour senators. I should like to know why this bill was introduced. Was it because the Government feared that it would not be able to retain the existing rate of &#163;4 10s. a ton in the British tariff on galvanized iron, and &#163;3 8s. a ton on barbed wire? The principle of bountypayments is wrong. </para>

                            <para>- No. High protection for secondary industries, thus enabling them to charge exorbitant prices for their products, is responsible for the present plight of the wheat industry, and renders necessary the payment of a bounty to the growers to enable them to carry on. If the general tariff level were lower, the wheat industry would not be in its present desperate position. In this bill the Government is providing for a contingency which may not arise for the next ten or twenty years. Once it is placed on the statute-book, the Minister for Trade and Customs will be able to increase the rate of bounty to an amount corresponding to the amount by which the duties are reduced, without having to submit to Parliament a bill which may not be passed. It is time that the Government gave consideration to the interests of producers and consumers. Dp to the present time manufacturers have been getting more than a fair deal from successive governments. The, time is rapidly approaching when the Government should appoint to the Tariff Board an economic adviser, who would advise regarding the economic effects of proposed new duties or increases of existing duties. It is significant that Labour senators have consistently supported all proposals to increase the tariff burdens on the community. Often I wonder whether they are sincere in their declaration that they represent the  workers, and when they prate about their consistent support of legislation for the good of all sections of the community. Obviously they are wilfully blind to the effect on the industrial classes of certain Government proposals. I wonder if it is any consolation to Ministers to know that, in the revision of the tariff, they so often had to depend upon the votes of Labour senators, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> than whom no more ardent supporter of high duties is to be found in this chamber. </para>

                            <para>- What greater proof of Labour and Government unity, in regard to tariff matters, is necessary than that witnessed in this chamber on Wednesday last, when, to save this bill, the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> led the Labour party across the chamber to secure the adjournment of the debate. Although the Labour party has always declared its opposition to anything in the nature of* monopolies, Labour senators voted with the Government to impose such high duties on galvanized iron and barbed wire, as would give to the manufacturers a monopoly of the Australian market. The Government, in tariff matters, appears to have the unhappy knack of ignoring the interests of the consumers, because it gives more and more protection to manufacturers, whose principal object is to make what they can out of the community. In this matter the Government stands condemned in the eyes of primary producers, and must share with the Labour party the responsibility for failing to protect adequately the rural industries, which create real wealth and establish credit overseas for the payment of our external obligations. Such a short-sighted policy is condemned by all thinking people, particularly in the smaller States, such as South Australia. On numerous occasions during the tariff debate the Government had the support of only a minority of the ministerial senators, and but for the votes of Labour senators very few of its more important proposals would have been carried. Usually one expects the Government to command a majority from among its own supporters, but a perusal of the division lists shows that, during the debate on the. tariff schedule, it depended for its majority on the votes of Labour senators. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber were elected to support a lower tariff than that in operation at the time of their election. This Government said that it proposed to reduce customs duties, but it has retained many of those imposed by the Scullin Government, and has reduced only slightly many others. Although the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> said that he was opposed to the indiscriminate increase of customs duties, and particularly when the increases were not recommended by the Tariff Board, the reductions made by this Government have been only of a minor character. The members of the Labour partyin this chamber solidly supported the Government&#39;s proposals for the imposition of unnecessarily high customs duties, and in many instances, the support which the Government received from the Labour party was greater than that which it had from honorable senators on this side of the chamber. The Government was elected on the promise that it would reduce customs duties, and would give to primary producers a just deal, but neither the primary producers nor the consumers have received fair treatment. I am opposed to the bill, and shall vote against the second reading. </para>

                        <para>. - The treatment which this innocent machinery measure has received at the hands of the Senate, suggests that I gave a very imperfect explanation of the bill,and of the principal act which it proposes to amend. I remind those honorable senators who have expressed their own fiscal opinions and have commented on the fiscal policy of the Government, that this measure does not affect customs duties. Section 3 of the Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act of 1922 reads - </para>

                        <para>Provided that the rates of bounty payable on any fencing wire, galvanized sheets, traction engines, or wire netting, delivered from the Australian factory after the introduction of a customs tariff bringing into operation increased duties of customs on any of those articles, shall be decreased by an amount, in the opinion of the Minister, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, corresponding to the amount by which the respective duties of customs are increased. </para>

                    <para class="block">In other words, Parliament decided that bounties should be payable on fencing wire, galvanized sheets, traction engines or wire netting, and that if customs duties were increased the bounty should be reduced. At present the proviso operates in only one way. When duties are increased the bounties automatically decrease, but when the duties are lowered the bounties do riot automatically increase. This measure is intended to make the variation operate in both ways. There seems to be some misapprehension on the part of honorable senators because the Government has introduced this comprehensive measure in consonance with the scope of the original act instead of limiting its scope to traction engines. In July, 1930, when primage duty was first imposed on traction engines the rate of duty was 2&#189; per cent. Later in that year it was increased to 4 per cent., and in 1931 to 10 per cent. When a. primage duty was imposed in 1931 the bounty of &#163;90 on traction engines was reduced to &#163;43 4s. Primage has been withdrawn from these engines, but under the existing legislation the bounty cannot be restored. It is provided that the bounty on fencing wire, galvanized sheets and wire netting, as well as on traction engines, shall be increased when customs duties on those items are reduced. The measure has been drafted to render the legislation on the statute-book effective. </para>

                            <para>- The language of the act compels us to do so; it refers to &#34; increased duties of customs &#34;. That term covers primage; at all events the Government is advised by the Crown Law officers that this amendment is required. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> referred to the measure as a &#34; reduction of duties prevention bill&#34;, but I repeat that it has nothing whatever to do with a reduction of duties. If the duties on the articles mentioned in the bill are increased the bounties will be reduced, but unless this amendment is made there is no machinery for the bounty to be increased following a reduction of customs protection. If honorable senators believe that the Government is unnecessarily legislating with respect to certain items, further consideration can be given in committee to that aspect of the subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> B. Johnston supported a reduction of duties on galvanized iron, and urged the substitution of assistance by means of a bounty. </para>

The one point made in the debate which might induce the Government to accept an amendment in committee is that the bill is not required at present in regard to wire netting, galvanized sheets, and fencing wire. When the measure is in committee I shall consider the deletion of those items to which exception has been taken. If the bill is agreed to the position will be the same as under the old act, in that action by the Minister will have to be preceded by a report from the Tariff Board. Honorable senators should be content to accept the proposal in the bill, especially in regard to traction engines. </para>

However foolish Australia has been in the past, its reputation has been re-established throughout the world. Under the existing legislation, the Government cannot pay a bounty on traction engines, and for that reason this bill has been introduced. No fiscal principle for which the opponents of the bill stand is being violated, and I ask the Senate to agree to the second reading. </para>

                    <para>.- Whateverthe attitude of the Minister to the amendment, I cannot support it. This bill seeks to amend the principal act, and the two measures will be inconsistent if the amendment is agreed to. The Minister said that the bounty was reduced when the primage was added, and that the Government now wants the bounty to be restored because the primage has been removed. If the amendment is accepted, the only item in respect of which the bounty will be increased as the result of the removal of the primage duty will be traction engines. I shall supportthe clause in its present form. </para>

                <para> - I support the amendment. The manufacture of traction engines in Australia is not in the hands of a monopoly as is the manufacture of galvanized iron. Moreover, the users of traction engines are being treated fairly by Australian manufacturers of this class of machinery. I am not surprised that only 172,000 tons of galvanized iron was used in Australia last year, because the price of this commodity is so high. If a bounty of  &#163;3 10s. aton  is granted in lieu of duty, the Newcastle works will benefit by about  &#163;250,000  per annum. That is a huge sum to pay to one manufacturing concorn, especially when the money  comes  from the pockets of the poorer sections of the community, who are the chief users of galvanized  iron. </para>

                    <para>- That is not so. The managing director of a reputable firm which deals in galvanized iron, both in Australia and in New Zealand, has informed me that the price of this commodity in Australia is  &#163;3 10s.  a ton more than in New Zealand. I am in favour of encouraging the manufacturers of traction engines, because of their fair treatment of the users of such machines. They are not exploiting the users to the same extent as are the manufacturers of galvanized iron, and, for that reason,  1  shall support the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes.</inline></para>

                <para>-  I intend to support the amendment, becausethe Minister  in  charge of the bill practically limited  his  remarks to the need for the application of this bounty to traction engines. The outstanding feature of his second-reading speech was that the measure  would  be applied only to traction  engines.

                    <para>. - I desire to offer a few comments, which go more to the root of the matter than does the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes.</inline> Section  3  of the principal act enacts that the bounty shall be payable subject to the proviso that, if the duty upon the articles specified is increased, the rates of bounty payable upon them shall be decreased by a corresponding amount. It seems incredible that Parliament did not provide for the converse position by enacting that, if the customs duty were decreased, the rate of bounty should be correspondingly increased. I feel that it did not overlook that contingency, and that it did not insert the proviso now proposed for the reason that it did not regard its insertion as necessary. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Minister in charge of the bill says that, although the primage duty has been removed,the bounty cannot be increased. Frankly, I cannot accept that position. When a duty is increased, what procedure is followed? Is an order in council passed, or by what authority is the increased customs charge collected? Obviously, the Minister has merely to refrain from collecting extra duty, and it is not collected. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite evident that the Crown Solicitor of 1922 did not think the same as the Crown Solicitor does to-day. To me it is incredible that the draftsman of the principal act did not contemplate the possibility of a converse position arising. I was not present when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> made his second-reading speech, but I read it very carefully in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> this morning, and I find that the statements of those who say that he rested his whole case upon traction engines, is absolutely correct. He never mentioned the other articles. It seems clear that we can differentiate between traction engines and the other three articles. I shall therefore support the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes.</inline></para>

                    <para>.- The Crown Law authorities differ from the view expressed by my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan.</inline> Under section 3 of the Principal Act there is no authority to increase bounties when once they have been reduced by the operation of the law. That is my opinion, and it is an opinion which is concurred in by the Attorney-General&#39;s Department. If it acted in the way suggested by the honorable senator, the Customs Department would be held responsible under the Audit Act. None of the other articles enumerated in the bill, save wire netting, is receiving the benefit of any bounty whatever. Wire netting receives the nominal bounty of 9s.7d. a ton. In regard to traction engines, however, the position is different and must be met. Before there can be any alteration of the incidence of the protection afforded to any of these articles other than traction engines, parliamentary action will be necessary. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment is another challenge to the principle of the maintenance of Australian industries. The Minister said that the bill was practically of a machinery nature, but I point out that it provides for the payment of such bounty as is &#34;necessary for the maintenance of the industry. &#34; Whether honorable senators opposite prefer to call themselves fair traders, free-traders or high protectionists, they were surely elected to main tain Australian industries. If the amendment is accepted, the bill might as well be thrown out altogether, for only a shell would be left. If there was a full attendance of honorable senators the amendment would be defeated. Very few honorable senators are &#34; game &#34; enough to go before the people and advocate a tariff policy which would destroy Australian industries. I hope that the amendment will be defeated. </para>

                    <para>.- I thought that the discussion of this bill was unnecessary, because it is merely a machinery measure, designed for the more effective working of the principle contained in an act already on the statute-book. Apparently I was in error, because honorable senators professing to represent farming communities arc strenuously opposing it, and amendments which have been proposed are aimed at the destruction of essential secondary industries. In the course of the next few days, those honorable senators will be appealing to Labour senators to support a proposal to assist wheat-farmers to the amount of over &#163;3,000,000. This being so, it is the more extraordinary that whenever we have before usGovernment measures for the protection of secondary industries, they oppose them. I am getting tired of their attitude towards the industrial section of the community, which I and other honorable senators of my party represent. It is no exaggeration  to say that more miles of wire netting for farmers have been paid for by the people of Australia than have been bought and paid for by the farmers themselves. Notwithstanding the generous assistance given by various governments to the farmers at the expense of the taxpayers, the representatives of rural industries take the first chance they get to defeat proposals for the assistance of workers in secondary industries. It is a grave reflection on the Government that, for the passage of this and other similar measures, it has to depend upon the support of the Labour senators. I regret that some of my own colleagues are, for various reasons, unavoidably absent. It is the duty of the Government to have a sufficient number of its supporters in attendance to ensure the passage of its measures. </para>

I am not here for fun. I have set for myself a standard of political honour never to make a statement which I know to be untrue. Coming from the source it does, the remark is exceedingly offensive to me, and I ask for its withdrawal and an apology. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and I, who have consistently advocated the cause of the workers and of the primary producers in New South Wales, have no doubts in that direction. If the leader of the &#34; Black swan brigade &#34; wishes to &#34; lock horns &#34; with me at the pre-selection ballot or on the hustings, I invite him to do so. Matters of great importance to the representatives of Queensland are also awaiting discussion. I hope that it is not proposed to have all-night sittings in order to dispose of the business to be dealt with before Parliament adjourns for the Christmas vacation. I understand that the Government is contemplating a reconstruction of its budget, apparently because the prosperity which the Government declared was just around the corner has now disappeared around another corner! We are asked to adjourn until Thursday in order that the House of Representatives may deal with the Estimates. I should like to know the policy of the Government in regard to a flour tax. </para>

                    <para>. - I, too, protest against the proposed adjournment of the Senate till Thursday. There is business on the notice-paper which could be dealt with, and, if necessary, the Standing and Sessional Orders could be suspended for that purpose. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> frequently moves for their suspension to meet the wishes of the Government, and similar action could be taken to enable motions in the name of private members to bo discussed. I am interested in the motions standing in the names of Senators Dunn&#39; and Rao, and am of the opinion that an opportunity to discuss them should be given. It is not right that honorable senators should be forced to spend to-morrow playing golf or bowls when there is public business awaiting their attention. </para>

                    <para>. -  I hope that when the Senate meets on Thursday there will be work for us to do. I make a practice of being here when the Senate is sitting, but I do not care to spend more time in Canberra than is necessary. Particularly do I dislike being brought here only to find that there is no business to engage the attention of the Senate. Twice this session the Senate has adjourned for a fairly lengthy period - fourteen days on one occasion, and thirteen days on another. To-day, we have sat for less than three hours, and it is now suggested that the Senate shall adjourn until 3 p.m. on Thursday. I do not blame the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> for he cannot be held responsible for delays which take place in the other chamber, but the Government should arrange its business better. Even when the Senate adjourns for a fortnight honorable senators from Western Australia have only about one and a-half days at home; they arrive home on Friday morning and have to leave again the following day to reach Canberra in time for the sitting on the following Thursday. And this is only possible when the Leader of the Senate arranges for the Senate to meet on Thursdays instead of on Wednesdays after an adjournment. Were that not done a fortnight&#39;s adjournment would not enable senators from Western Australia to visit their homes. I hope that in future, when we are dragged to the </para>

                    <para>. - I protest against the proposed adjournment until Thursday not merely because I have a motion on the business-paper, but also because this is one of a number of occasions on which honorable senators have been brought here only to find little or no business awaiting them. Unlike <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> B. Johnston, I do blame Ministers. They should arrange their business better. Unfortunately, the lot of a private member in any parliament, whether he be a supporter or an opponent of the Government, is to be humbugged and kicked about at the will of ministers. There is a growing tendency for governments to do as they like and for parliamentary control of the executive to become weaker. Private members are like footballs, to be kicked about at the will of the Government in power. Honorable senators know that the reason for the adjournment is that the House of Representatives has not dealt with certain business. </para>

                        <para>- Practically every professor in the country has been consulted by the Government in an attempt to frame its policy, and when it thinks that it has made up its mind, another professor comes along with a fresh idea, and the Government&#39;s policy is re-cast. The Government is humbugging members and hoodwinking the people. Its legislative programme is a thing of shreds and patches. We are accustomed to pass a measure to-day, reverse it to-morrow, recommit it the next day, and then go home having laboriously done nothing. I protest against this method of conducting the public business. As regards the precedence of private member&#39;s business on Thursday evenings, I endorse all that has been said by my colleague. Government after government has attempted to destroy whatever small opportunity private members formerly enjoyed for the ventilation of grievances. Our standing orders can be suspended readily enough to rush through Government business, and to this end we constantly forego all the safeguards involved in delay between the various stages of bills. Indeed the only standing order observed in this House is one for the suspension of our standing orders. Yet while that practice is followed almost daily, and whilst contingent notices of motion are tabled to permit of certain measures being put through at express speed, no proposition is submitted for the discussion of private members&#39; business when Government business fails. Honorable senators are not consulted in regard to the private business which they place on the notice paper, yet they are expected to render every possible assistance to get Government business through promptly. When they have done that, they discover that their own business is hung up indefinitely. I hope that if this Government will not mend its ways, it will be replaced by a government which will do the right thing in this connexion, and which, when defeated, will make way for another government that will follow in its footsteps. </para>

                <para class="block">When the Prime Minister was in Queensland, this particular section of the community requested that a special inquiry should be conducted into the conditions existing in the tobacco industry there. The report by the committee which investigated those conditions, has been submitted to the Government and presented to Parliament. That report has come as a thunderbolt to this section of the tobacco-growing industry, particularly in view of the fact that one of those who are responsible for it, is a gentleman who was mainly instrumental in attracting settlers to that portion of Queensland. Whilst I admit that there was a certain amount of go-getting and salesmanship in connexion with settlement in the Mareeba district, it is a fact that many of the settlers were invited to settle there by the Grown. Crown lands were made available to them, and they were induced to believe that the area was the most suitable in Australia for tobacco culture. During the first two years of their settlement, their operations were entirely successful. They had good crops for which they obtained satisfactory prices. As a result more men settled in the district and made it their home. But, in the report which has now been presented to Parliament, the district itself, as a tobacco growing area, is very severely criticized. This is inexplicable, seeing that one of the members who conducted the inquiry was himself largely instrumental in imbuing settlers with the idea that the district is eminently suited to tobacco cultivation. The truth is that during the present year an abnormal rainfall has brought into the crop a disease known as &#34; froggy eye.&#34; What action does the Government propose in respect of the recommendations contained in that report ? Many of those recommendations relate to matters within the jurisdiction of the State government, but some of them call for Commonwealth action.For instance, one recommendation is that greater powers should be vested in the States, and that the Commonwealth should more or less abandon the tobacco arena. The increase of the customs duty on imported tobacco by 6d. per lb. will be of only slight assistance to the locally-grown leaf. The main inducement we can offer Australians to smoke the local product is to make it cheaper than the imported. That is the quickest way of encouraging the consumption of locally-grown tobacco. </para>

                <para> - We need to make it available to smokers in the easiest method possible. Much of the disfavour with which the local product is regarded arises from prejudice. It is very doubtful whether many men who claim to be connoisseurs of tobacco can discriminate be tween the imported and the local article. The report of the committee has caused much concern in the most northern portion of Queensland. To those who have looked upon Mareeba as an ideal place for tobacco cultivation, it has occasioned the greatest surprise. The extra 6d. per lb. customs duty imposed on imported tobacco is intended to enable the Government to collect more revenue so that it may give further relief to the wheatgrowers. I hope, however, that it will not be regarded as the final measure of assistance to be accorded the tobacco growers. I suggest that if another 6d. per lb. excise duty were levied upon imported manufactured tobacco, the Australian factories would be encouraged to continue to purchase the locally-grown leaf. The report states that the committee examined bales of locally-grown leaf which had been rejected by buyers, and that it generally upheld the action taken by the BritishAustralasian Tobacco Company. But there are scores of farmers who have not had an opportunity this season to submit their leaf for purchase by the local buyers. I bring the matter forward because tobacco cultivation in Australia is destined to become more and more important, and it is imperative that the Government should take more cognizance of it. The Commonwealth, in conjunction with the States, should embark upon a definite campaign of instruction in respect of tobacco cultivation, so that Australian growers may become thoroughly familiar with the latest methods of curing the leaf, and may learn whether they are attempting to grow it in unsuitable soil. I trust that the policy of the Government will follow the lines I have suggested, thereby making Australian-grown tobacco leaf more attractive to local consumers. </para>

                    <para>I confirm the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> concerning the importance of the tobacco industry. I am in entire sympathy with the request from Mareeba, &#60; a copy of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll</inline> forwarded to his Queensland colleagues. It seems to me that an increase by 6d. of the customs duty on imported smoking tobacco would be helpful in providing assistance to the wheat industry, without imposing hardship on Australian smokers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> also said that an increase by 6d. of the excise duty would do no harm ; and I point out that, those who have invested their capital in the cultivation of tobacco in Australia are especially desirous of making the industry a success, and the report of the expert committee which recently investigated the industry in Queensland is not particularly encouraging.- The tobacco-growers in that State think that the Government might further assist the industry on the lines suggested in the telegram which was read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll.</inline> I am heartily in accord with the proposal by Messrs. Hunter and Henderson, of Mareeba, and I hope that* the Government will take action as suggested by the presidents of the Mareeba Chamber of Commerce and the Tobaccogrowers Association at Mareeba. </para>

                        <para>. - I received an amazing reply to-day to questions submitted by me to the Minister representing the Minister administering war service homes. I asked whether it was a fact that the two officers whose services were dispensed with by the State Government Agricultural Bank on the Commonwealth Government resuming the administration of war service homos in Tasmania, were originally employed by the War Service Homes Commission; if so, what was the duration of their employment, and the remuneration paid in each case; and, further, whether they carried out their duties in an efficient manner when employed by the Deputy Commissioner prior to the Agricultural Bank taking over the administration of war service homes in Tasmania. I first brought this matter under notice on the 17th November, and I received a reply from the Minister on the 21st November. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> records that the Minister stated, &#34;I wish to emphasize that these officers were not in any way employed by the Commonwealth &#34;. The Minister, had been misinformed, because, of course, these officers had been in the employ of the Commonwealth. I do not suggest that the Minister attempted to deceive me, but I claim that he has been misled. The reply received by me to my question as to whether these officers had carried out their duties in an effective manner when employed1 by the Deputy Commissioner prior to the Agricultural Bank taking over the administration of war service homes in Tasmania, was - &#34; The records available do not enable a definite statement to be made&#34;. If I were the Minister in charge of that department, I should blush with shame for trying to &#34;put over&#34; such a reply. Those who were in charge of the Deputy Commissioner&#39;s office in Tasmania at the time referred to are not dead. Therefore, it would be possible to obtain from them a reply to the question; the answer which I received is merely an evasion. If the Minister in charge of war service homes were now in his old battalion, and I were still his commanding officer, I should see that he did not give me a reply of that nature. It is necessary to submit question after question in order to get any information from the department. If the records available actually do not enable a definite statement to be made, the department and war service homes administration must be in a sorry mess. </para>

                    <para>In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> whose remarks were supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacDonald,</inline> I assure the honorable senator that the tobacco industry is giving the Government great concern. Apart from the report that has been furnished by the Expert Committee, a conference of the State authorities has been held. Every State was represented, except &#34;Western Australia, whose views were communicated in a letter received from the Premier of that State. The  conference,  which was attended by the official heads of the Agricultural- Departments in the various State&#39;s, assembled in Canberra about three weeks ago, and submitted certain recommendations regarding further expenditure for the purpose of instructing the growers in the cultivation, curing, and other treatment of tobacco. I have submitted their recommendations, together with my own comments, to Cabinet, by whom the matter is now being considered. Speaking for myself, I regard this industry as of great importance to Australia, and its interests must be safeguarded in a number of ways. The diseases to which the tobacco plant&#39; is subject are numerous, and I can assure honorable senators that the Cabinet is giving the closest attention to the claims of the industry. </para>

            <para class="block">We should all like to know what is in the mind of the Government. Following the lead of its predecessor, it made a reduction of the basic wage, and as indicated in the criticism from this side of the chamber, it may be necessary to restore the  10  per cent, reduction made in salaries and wages of the Public Service to offset the increase of the cost of living due to the imposition of a sales tax on flour. </para>
