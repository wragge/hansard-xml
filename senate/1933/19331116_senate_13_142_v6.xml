                        <para>- A few moments ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> submitted to the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> a question of which, subsequently, he gave notice, concerning an incident in the career of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> E. Rofe, a well-known solicitor of Sydney. In his question, the honorable senator made a number of statements derogatory to the character of that gentleman. Is an honorable senator allowed to publish to the world statements containing half truths which are worse than a lie? I do not know whether you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have any knowledge of the facts of the case, or if you followed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> very closely; but I assume that when his question comes before you prior to being placed on the notice-paper for to-morrow, you will peruse it carefully. </para>

                        <para>- We must rely to a large extent on the good sense and fairness of honorable senators asking questions. Obviously, it is not in order to make damaging <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements relating to particular incidents in thecareer of any citizen of the Commonwealth, because of the harm that might&#34; bo done. The only safeguard is for honorable senators to refrain from making statements about the career of any citizen, unless they are satisfied that such statements are true. </para>

Honorable senators will realize that the Chair is in some difficulty because of the absence of any definite rule with regard to such matters.While an honorable senator may be entitled to mention incidents in the career of a citizen of the Commonwealth, common sense and fair play dictate that the line be drawn somewhere. I rule that it will not be in order for an honorable senator to make damaging statements about any citizen of the Commonwealth unless he is satisfied beyond all doubt as to their truth. In this instance I shall exercise my right, and direct that certain references to this gentleman be deleted. </para>

                                    <para> At my instigation the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,has already reported upon the De Raeve process. The council consulted one of the highest authorities in the matter, in the person of Associate Professor W. J. Young, Department of BioChemistry, University of Melbourne, who ad vised that the process did not possess any features which would commend it for consideration. The council is of opinion, following upon the results of practical demonstration, that the process which has been developed at its Food Preservation Laboratory, at the Brisbane Abattoir, will enable chilled beef to he transported from Australia to the London market. In these circumstances, and bearing in mind the advice tendered by Professor Young, it is not thought that any useful purpose would be served by a further investigation of the De Raeve process, unless substantial improvements have been effected since the process was examined. If such improvements have been made, and full details are submitted to me, I will consider whether I will arrange for a further expert opinion to be obtained. </para>

These duties would impose a direct burden on -primary industries, and I, therefore, urge the committee to adhere to it&#39;s previous decision. </para>

                        <para>.- The Government, in pressing for this increase of duties, shows a total disregard for the serious condition of the fruit industry. Both at Shepparton and in Tasmania, the canners are unable to dispose profitably of last season&#39;s output, and these heavy duties will have serious repercussions. The Government should realize that the United Kingdom offers a most promising market for Australian canned fruits. Canned fruits to the  value  of nearly &#163;1,500,000 were imported into Great Britain during the last six months, but the proportion that was obtained from Australia was almost negligible. I hope that the committee will stand by its original vote. </para>

The Broken Hill Proprietary Limited has supplied the following information since this request was made: - </para>

                    <para>These deferred, duties were placed in the tariff in 1920, and since that time the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited has been developing its plant, having in mind the manufacture of tinned plate in Australia. The duties have served for the last thirteen years as an incentive to the local industry to undertake the manufacture of these goods. Parliament should recognize its obligations in the matter, and not delete the duties, for that would be tantamount to expressing the opinion that the commencement of this industry in Australia is undesirable. The two questions (1) whether the deferred duties are necessary and (2) if so, what duties should be placed in the schedule, are now being considered by the Tariff Board, and no action apart from further deferring the operation of the duties will be taken by the Government until such time as the Tariff Board has submitted its report. Honorable senators will realize that these duties will not be imposed before the Tariff Board has fully investigated the possibilities of economic manufacture in Australia. One of the provisions which the Tariff Board must consider is whether the goods can be produced at a reasonable price, having regard, among other things, to the probable economic effect of the imposition of the deferred duty upon other industries concerned, and upon the community in general. It will, therefore, bo seen that the interests of all concerned will be fully safeguarded. Since the deferred duties are not now operating, and are not likely to operate for a considerable time, it would appear that no harm would be done to the industry contemplating the local manufacture of tinned plates if the request were adopted; but if the deferred duties remain in the schedule for some time at least, while tha local industry is not ready to produce, no harm can possibly be done to other industries. The Government is averse to pressing this request as it considers that the deletion, of the deferred duties from the tariff would be an indication to the company that Parliament did not desire this industry to be commenced in Australia. In view of this I ask that the request be not pressed, and that the item, as amended by the House of Representatives, be agreed to. No action  will  be taken that could possibly harm the canning industry. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> put up a very good case from the point of view of the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited, but ignored the desperate plight of fruit-growers and the canning industry.  His  remarks have merely confirmed me in my intention to vote against the Government in connexion with this item. I hope that, in the interests, of the canning industry of Australia, the request will be pressed. </para>

                        <para>. - This is one of the many items in the tariff concerning which the layman is entirely at sea. We do not know precisely what protection this deferred duty will give to the industry concerned. All we know is that originally this  item was  free British, and carried a duty of 10 per cent, in the general tariff. It is now proposed to impose, as from the. 1st January next, deferred duties of 76s. a ton British, and 115s. general. Can the Minister give any information as to the selling price of the material, and state what is the rate per cent, of the deferred duty? Honorable senators are entitled to know how much protection it is propos_ed to give to the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited. </para>

                        <para>. - I am advised that the proposed deferred duty of 76s. a ton British is equivalent to an ad valorem rate of 23 per cent. It has been in the tariff since 1920. The recommendations of the Tariff Board will be considered before action is taken to make the deferred duty operative. I realize that those honorable senators who are pressing the Senate&#39;s request desire to make a gesture in the interests of the fruit-canning industry; but I would remind them that  the deferred duty will not affect this season&#39;s pack. </para>

                            <para>- That. I suggest, is all the more reason why we should not press the Senate&#39;s request. We desire to see the industry established on an economic basis. If the Senate persists in its request, it will be an indication that it does not wish the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited to go any further with its plans, although already it has expended approximately &#163;500,000 on plant for the production of tinned plates. This item is part of the iron and steel duties. </para>

                        <para>. - I trust that the committee will oppose the motion. Since this item, was before fhe committee on a previous occasion, I have received numerous communi cations from local manufacturers who say that, in view of the exchange adjustment recently decided upon, they will be unable ro carry on with duties of 20 per cent. British and 374 per cent, general. I have also been supplied with price lists showing that the Australian, orchardists are now obtaining their spray pumps at a cheaper rate than they otherwise could. The point which I cannot understand is that although fruit-growers can obtain their supplies at prices lower than those charged for the imported article, the manufacturers are pressing for an unusually high duty. I trust that the committee will agree to the duties of British 20 per cent, and general 37&#189; per cent. </para>

It should be our endeavour ro reduce the costs of production of fruit growers to the lowest possible level. It appears that Australian manufacturers are receiving all the consideration, and the fruit-growers who arc compelled to buy these pumps are not receiving the assistance they deserve. </para>

                            <para>- A hand pump costs only a few shillings, but a motor spray pump may cost as much as &#163;130. This year, the fruit growers, particularly those in Tasmania, sent hundreds of thousands of cases of apples and pears to Great Britain for which they did not receive anypayment at all. In many instances, they were asked to forward remittances to defray handling and other charges. Although the wheat-growers receive some return for their commodity many of the fruit-growers havo not got any tiling at all.  In  the winter, fruit-growers spray with oil, and later on they must spray three or four times with lime sulphur or some other preparation in order to protect their crops. If the Australian manufacturers can supply pumps at prices lower than the cost of the imported article, why should they require high duties? If unnecessarily high ratesare imposed and costs arc not reduced, the fruit-growers will be compelled to appeal to Parliament for further assistance. </para>

                        <para>. - Since this matter was last considered by the committee, the Customs Department has obtained certain additional information which indicates that some imported spray pumps could, if a lower duty were imposed, compete with the Australian product, but in the ease of other lines the present duties are required. The Government proposes to refer the duties back to the Tariff Board for further inquiry and report, but meanwhile I suggest that the existing rates should remain. It would be better if this item were sub-divided. In the United Kingdom the retail price of hand operated bucket, spray pumps, model A1, is 30s.; that of the Australian article is 31s. 6d. For the model A pump the English price is 24s. 6d. and the Australian price 32s. 6d. For the Knapsack spray pump the Australian price varies from 75s. to80s. and the British price from 92s. 6d. to 97s. 6d. For barrel spray pumps the Australian price is &#163;6 7s. 6d. and the New Zealand retail price of similar pumps imported from the United States of America is &#163;8 2s. 6d. I have not the price of the British product. In these circumstances I suggest that the request should not be pressed. </para>

As stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes many fruit-exporters have not received any money for their labour: the reward of the year&#39;s efforts of many of them is a debit instead of a credit. Fruit-growers work continuously  throughout the year, and their . duties are more arduous than those of any other primary producer. I trust that those who supported the request on the previous occasion, will oppose the motion. </para>

                        <para>.- I trust that the committee will press for a reduction of the duties to 20 per cent. British and 37&#189; per cent, general. I cannot understand why any honorable senator should penalize primary producers who are in such sore financial straits. The Australian fruit-growers are disposing of the bulk of their products in the markets of the world without any protection whatever. Fruit growing provides one of the most desirable forms of closer settlement, and those engaged in it have developed virgin land to a remarkable extent. This year many fruit-growers in Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia have not received the cost of production. Some who were fortunate enough to sell on the earlier markets is Great Britain received a few shillings a case, but many others, through no fault of their own, did not receive any return at all. The Almighty may send a hail storm, and in half an hour, the whole crop will be destroyed. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator must know that the reduction of this duty would be some indication of our desire to help the orchardists. We are sometimes accused of pandering to the big man, but that cannot be said on this occasion. The men whose interests we are now endeavouring to protect are small, hardworking, struggling settlers, who are doing a useful service to the State by turning waste lands into productive orchards. I should be prepared to vote for the free admission of these goods, if necessary, and I certainly support the request for the reduction of duty. </para>

The board reported that, not only was the price of the Australian-made article lower than that at which similar articles were being sold abroad, but that the quality was better. It also pointed out that the industry furnished employment to Australian workers at satisfactory rates of pay. I have not heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes say that the price of zinc should he reduced, or that the duty on carbide is too high, yet he is not prepared to assist secondary industries on the mainland. Honorable senators of the Country party are fond of saying that Parliament should be guided in tariff matters by the Tariff Board, but in this instance, the board has recommended in favour of the retention of the present duties. My vote will be recorded in support of an Australian industry that employs men who spend their wages in Australia. The workers in this industry buy the fruit grown by the orchardists who use the spray pumps. I suspect that honorable senators who are opposed to the present rates of duty are merely hoping to create a favorable impression among the orchardists in their State, with a view to winning their votes. </para>

                        <para>. - Since December, 1932, when the Tariff Board made the report to which the honorable senator has referred, the board has again considered the position of the industry with a view to subdividing the items, on some of which, I admit, the amount of protection now afforded may not be necessary. The board expressed the opinion that the present rates of duty provided for reasonable competition between Australian and United Kingdom manufacturers. No hand spray pumps have come in for a considerable time, and the board commended the fourteen Australian manufacturers of these goods for their efficiency, and for keeping faith with the public with regard to prices. </para>

                            <para>-Do honorable senators propose to. set themselves up as a dissecting body to undertake the task of determining what particular duties shall apply to such articles as spray pumps and garden syringes? Should we not be dealing with the matter in rather an unscientific way if we endeavoured to determine such details without having all the facts before us? Australia requires spray pumps to the value of about &#163;50,000 annually, and the fact that no complaint has reached the board from the representatives of the fruit-growers concerning the goods supplied by the local manufacturers, shows that the latter are not taking an unfair advantage of the tariff. </para>

                        <para>. - It is true, as pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn,</inline> that a study of the price lists issued by reputable firms in the United Kingdom and New Zealand shows that the Australian prices are about the same, or perhaps a little lower, and are similar to those charged in the United States of America. This fact appears to provide a ray of hope that Australian secondary industries may be able to compete in the markets of the world. The Tariff Board, in its report issued about two years ago, stated that Australian orchardists were obtaining good spray pumps from the local manufacturers at lower prices than those at which similar goods could be obtained from overseas; therefore, 1 cannot understand why heavy duties are desired. The only conclusion at which I can arrive is that the local manufacturers wish to keep the Australian market entirely to themselves. The original duties of 45 per cent. British and 65 per cent, general are prohibitive. When I discussed this matter with a representative of one of the leading manufacturers of these goods, whose factory is situated at Petersham, New South Wales, he was unable to give me a satisfactory explanation of why heavy duties were needled. He merely said. &#34;We want the Australian market to ourselves.&#34; Duties of 20 per cent. British, and 37-^ per cent, general ought to be sufficient, and would keep the local industry in a healthy condition. I trust that the committee will adhere to its previous decision. </para>

Although for four of those years I was&#39; a member of the Senate, for the remainder of the period I did most of the work on the orchard, and therefore, am familiar with the difficulties of fruit growers. It is unreasonable to. suggest that the success or failure of the industrydepends on whether an extra shilling or two has to be paid for a hand spray pump. The arguments advanced by those who oppose the higher duties, are contradictory. In one instance we  are  told that the rates should be reduced in order that the Australian fruit-growers may receive cheaper pumps. On the other hand, they admit that in countries where the industry is not protected similar pumps are considerably- dearer than in </para>

                    <para class="block">Australia. It follows, therefore, that a reduction of the duty would not mean cheaper pumps for Australian orchardists^ We should not regard the Tariff Board as an extra parliamentary body whose reports should, in every instance, be accepted; but if we are not in agreement with the board in respect to any particular item, we should bo able to expose the weakness of its case. Honorable senators who are pressing the request have not brought forward any argument to show that, in tins matter, the board is in error, so we must assume that the manufacturers are not profiting unduly from the protection given to them. </para>

                            <para>- If the existing protection were withdrawn importing firms would be able to destroy the Australian industry, and, having done that, would be free to raise their prices against&#39; Australian users of spray pumps. This has happened over and over again in the history of Australian industries. Therefore, instead of its being a crime for local manufacturers to seek to obtain the whole of the Australian market, it is really a reasonable and businesslike course. The population of Australia, being so limited, it is essential that local manufacturers should be assured of the greater part of the market so as to expand production, and market their goods at competitive prices. If, owing to unrestricted competition from manufacturers in Great Britain or the United States of America, they had only a small portion of the Australian market, they could not be expected to produce at present prices, and it would not be long before the industry would be destroyed. I admit that the fruit-growing industry is in a bad way, largely because of the perishable nature of the output, the prices being so low that, in some cases, no income is provided for the growers. On numerous occasions earlier in my life, I ploughed in large quantities of beautiful lemons, which, had they been marketed, would not have &#39; returned me the cost of the cases and selling agents&#39; commission. Yet much inferior fruit was, at that time, selling in Sydney at a fairly good price. The difficulty with the fruit-growing industry is the enormous gap between the price receivedby the grower and the price paid by the consumer. </para>

                        <para>. -  This debate seems to be largely concerned with the question of profits and losses. Apparently, the Government is determined, with the support of the Opposition, to ensure high profits for the manufacturers of spray . pumps, and heavy losses for fruit-growers. I fail to understand the reasons why the Government is not pressing the Senate&#39;s request on this item. The figures quoted by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> show that piunps manufactured locally are being sold more cheaply than the imported article. This being the case, there is no need for a high rate of duty. Apparently, the Government litis made up its mind that&#34; the profits of the manufacturer must be guarded without regard to the position of the fruitgrower. I was surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline> should support the Government in this matter, because a large number of fruit-growers in a small way in South Australia are affected by this duty. We are told that the local market is the best market, but if, as has been the case during the last two or three years, fruit-growers are suffering losses both at home and abroad, the local market is no better than the overseas market. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> sought to justify the establishment of the smaller industries in Australia by arguing that they provide employment and keep down prices. I do not agree with him. The establishment of so many minor industries on an uneconomic basis has a very seriouseffect on other Australian industries. If a small manufacturer is making a decent living, others set up in competition with him, and it is not long before they come together to make representations for higher protection, thus enabling them to increase prices. </para>

                        <para>. -  It is only fair that I should explain that this industry was examined by the Tariff Board &#39;before the Ottawa agreement was made. There has been no inquiry since then. The suggestion that the Australian manufacturers are making big profits at the expense of the fruit-growers is not borne out by the facts. The requirements of the Australian market are estimated at about &#163;50,000 per annum, and there are fourteen firms manufacturing spray pumps. . If all shared the market equally, each would be receiving about &#163;4,000 per annum, which would not allow of huge profits after allowing for the costs of raw material and wages. It is because they have the Australian market that they are able to manufacture this article so cheaply. </para>

                        <para>. -  Some honorable senators have argued that, because this item affects a minor industry, the request should not be pressed. But is it not possible that this duty is regarded by fruit-growers as equivalent to the last straw which, we have been told, broke the camel&#39;s back? Fruit-growers and other primary producers, suffering as they  are, from a multiplicity of tariff and other taxation burdens, naturally feel that some relief should be afforded them by the removal of a portion of the excessive protection given to a number of secondary industries. That the tariff has not, as has been contended, been framed on scientific lines, is plain from the number of inconsistencies .in the rates of duty on such goods as internal combustion engines and rabbit traps. When the present schedule is ratified, it will publish to the world the matured opinion of this Parliament, that the rate of duty required for the protection of an Australian manufacturer of an internal combustion engine, is also necessary for the manufacture of such a simple article as a rabbit trap. It is claimed that duties of 45 per cent. British and 65 per cent, general are necessary to protect the industry. Australian manufacturers have become accustomed  to  such high protective duties that we shall have to remodel our ideas of what are reasonable rates. Some years ago a duty of 25 per cent, was considered exorbitant, but rates have now soared to such an extent that in many instances the protection amounts to approximately 10.0 per cent, when all charges are brought to account. Let us study the subject from another angle. Unnecessarily high duties affect primary producers struggling to hold their own against overseas competition. The fruit-growers have not any protection when their product is placed alongside, similar products from other countries in the London and Hamburg markets. They- are handicapped not only by excessive competition, but also by exorbitant duties on many of the commodities that they require. The duties are imposed to support those engaged in secondary production in Australia. Fruitgrowers conduct their operations on light soil that is unsuitable for dairying, or wheat-growing. Land with a clay subsoil that is too poor for almost any other purpose can be used for fruit-growing. Those producing fruit are using the waste lands of this country. </para>

Yet these men are called upon to pay a duty of 45 per cent, to help Australian manufacturers. According to the annual report of the Federal Commissioner of Taxation, the total taxable income of primary producers, including fruit-growers, in 1918, was &#163;12,000,000. What is their taxable income to-day? Only about &#163;2,000,000 remains. For every &#163;5 of taxable income in 1918, there is les3 than &#163;1 to-day. What has happened to the manufacturing interests which, in this instance, are asking for a duty of 45 per cent.? In 1918, their taxable income was approximately &#163;2,000,000, but to-day it is &#163;9,000,000. The Senate has the responsible duty to request&#39; the reduction of customs imposts and thus assist primary producers. The secondary industries are receiving too much assistance, and are not shouldering their share of the burden. Many primary producers are broken in spirit and in pocket, because the tariff is not properly balanced. I oppose the motion. </para>

The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline> McLachlan)  has admitted that information obtained by the Trade and Customs Department since this matter was last before the Senate, has led it to the conclusion that Australian manufacturers of these articles could succeed with lower duties than they now actually enjoy, and, apparently, could also succeed under the duties requested by this chamber. Of course, if the figures supplied to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> are accurate, it is clear that they could succeed without any protection at all.

                            <para>- I cannot rest assured that no harm has been done if the rates of duty are so high as to prohibit importations. Until quite recently, a protectionist, however ardent he might claim to be, did not favour absolute prohibition. We now find that advocates of&#39; prohibition of imports are quite common. They say, &#34; We want the local market to ourselves,&#34; and that is another way of demanding prohibition. But, sooner or later, harm must result from this policy. When cut off from world competition, there is no pressure on manufacturers to keep down prices. In the absence of competition, the Australian manufacturers will be able to do those things which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> said are done by the importers. Instead of competition among local manufacturers, we shall have combination. </para>

                            <para>- If I accept the assurance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> and the information I have seen in the press, that is always happening, but I do not believe it. There may be combination with respect to some patented articles, but with a free market, we are not likely to have a combination of inporters to regulate prices. There is another comment which I should like to make which relates not specifically to this item, but to other items which we have discussed. So far as we know no arguments were adduced in the House of Representatives why the duties originally proposed by the Government and adopted in that chamber should stand. After a long debate in this chamber, a request was carried that the duties on this item should be reduced from 45 per cent. British and 65 per cent, general to 20 per cent. British and 37&#189; general. So far as I know that request did not receive proper consideration, as the Minister in another place simply moved that the requested alteration of duty be not made. Up to the. present, no requests made by the Senate, except those initiated by the Government, have been accepted by the House of Representatives. In my opinion, it behoves the Senate, as abody possessing constitutional powers, to press its claims more strongly. </para>

                    <para>The facts obtained in connexion with this industry indicate that while the present rate of exchange is in operation, users would not obtain chains any cheaper if the duty were reduced. The adoption of the request would divide the market between importers and the local manufacturers. This would probably injure an industry which, although not large, appears to be operating economically. It provides an outlet for Australian steel, furnishes employment for twenty persons, and supplies good quality chain at reasonable prices. </para>
                    <para>Request No. 26, which gave effect to the rates of 27&#189; per cent. British, and 45 per cent, general on plough and trace chain and chains, as recommended by the Tariff Board, was agreed to by the House of Representatives. These rates are not high when &#39;the difference between wages and other production costs in Australia and those in other countries is taken into consideration. All the available information shows that prices are reasonable, and that the industry is operating efficiently. The committee is, therefore, asked not to press the request. </para>

                        <para>. - When this request was first moved in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> apparently recognized its justice, and accepted it without protest. For a long time, plough and trace chains were admitted free from Britain, while a duty of 15 per cent, was imposed on those imported from foreign countries. Then they were placed in item 325a, under which the duties were 45 per cent. British, and 65 per cent, general. The Senate&#39;s request was that the duties should again be free British, and 15 per cent, general. Item 325a covers chains made partly of leather, and though I was told that all plough and trace chains had been placed in that item, I am prepared to believe that the information was incorrect, and that the item really covered only those plough and trace chains which contained, some leather. The Minister said that twenty persons wore employed in this industry in Australia. Plough and trace chains are used by primary producers and others from one end of the continent to the other, and it is the wish of the Government to tax them for the benefit of twenty workers. </para>

So far, no requests of the Senate for reduced duties, except those moved by the Minister in charge of the bill, have been accepted by the House of Representatives, even though, as in the present instance, the request was made unanimously. Even the most reasonable requests have been treated in arrogant fashion by the House of Representatives. We should stand firmly on this matter. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that the Government has not accepted the duties requested at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson,</inline> who desired to reduce the rates for all saws to free British, and 35 per cent. general. The timber industry has suffered, probably, more than any other from the general depression, because the building trade has been inactive, and the local demand for timber has fallen to a negligible quantity. Overseas countries have not been taking the usual supplies of Australian timbers. In Western Australia it has been almost impossible to find a market for karri, and the local mills have been working on short time for the last three or four years. Only lately has the trade in jarrah improved slightly. Most of the saws required by the millers are imported, and they have to be replaced frequently. The well organized and efficient timber industry ordinarily affords much employment at good wages, and I trust that the committee will adhere to its previous decision. </para>

                        <para>.  - This item includes circular saws, which are tools of trade in the timber-milling industry. It was contended that the cost of a circular saw today is about half as much again as it was prior to the introduction of the Scullin tariff, and that the duties had placed a severe impost on this industry. When this item was last dealt with by the Senate the Tariff Board had not submitted its report. The report has since been received, and when the request was having attention in the House of Representatives, an amendment was made at the instance of the Government which brought the item into line with the Tariff Board&#39;s findings. This item covers principally the blades of circular saws for both wood and metal, band saws, and gang saws. The board ascertained that capital amounting to approximately &#163;30,000 is invested, and employment is given to 40 workers, who annually produce saws to the value of &#163;17,000, which is equivalent, to 70 per cent, of the total demand. Of the Australian production, 86 per cent. comprises circular saws. The Tariff Board was satisfied as to the efficiency of the industry in general, and considered that the rates recommended by it are necessary for the continuance of the manufacture of saws in Australia. The modified rates provide for the five admission from the United Kingdom of inserted tooth circular saws, which are of a type not manufactured in Australia. As the Tariff Board has submitted a recommendation since the Senate last dealt with this item, and this recommendation has been adopted by the House of Representatives, I ask honorable senators to accept the modification. </para>

                    <para>This request was submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> after two other requests for lower duties had been defeated. The reasons advanced for requesting lower duties were: - (1) To obtain lower prices for traps. (2) To give effect  to  the competitive level provided for in the Ottawa agreement. </para>
                    <para>The report of the Tariff Board shows that the industry is one for which Australian conditions as regards demand are suited. Local manufacturers make the class of traps required by the market of both the wire spring and the flat spring types. Practically all the raw materials used are of Australian origin. The capacity of Australian factories is sufficient to supply all demands, the local manufacture is efficient; and the users of the traps are not penalized. Some doubt was raised as to whether the Tariff Board&#39;s recommendation regarding these goods complies with the Ottawa agreement. A passage in the board&#39;s report in the following terms has perhaps given rise to such doubt :  - </para>

                        <para>The selling price to the trade  of  the Australian-made trap exceeds the landed coat duty free par exchange  of  the cheapest heavier type British trap by only four and one-sixth per cent... but it exceeds the corresponding landed cost  of  the &#34; Star and Crescent &#34; light British trap by 53 per cent. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>This matter was taken up with the Tariff Board, which replied in the following terms :  - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The board recognizes that the duty  of  45 per cent. is a higher protection than is necessary against the heavier traps but there  is  a lighter and cheaper trap being manufactured in the United Kingdom. The board&#39;s report (page  6  of printed copy) indicates that the selling price  to  the trade of the Australian-made trap exceeds the landed cost duty free par exchange of this light weight trap by 53 per cent. This trap, although not equal in quality to the Australian, could compete after paying the rate ofduty recommended by the board. If the duty were lower than that recommended by the board, competition would be unduly in favour of the imported line. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">This shows that in respect  of  the kind  of  trap in general demand, that is the trap of the light type, the present duties express the competitive levelso  far as  British manufacturers are concerned. The Tariff Board&#39;s report  on  this industry is comprehensive, and <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> whole of the findings  of  the board indicate that the local manufacturers are efficiently producing traps and selling them at prices very much below those operating prior to the imposition  of  the higher duties. The request was for a reduction  of  15 per cent. The exchange adjustment proposals operate in respect to this item, and the British preferential tariff is at present reduced by111/4 per cent., making it 333/4 per cent. About 150 persons are receiving employment in the &#34;manufacture of these articles locally. This industry has been  of  benefit to the users  of  these goods, and, in view  of  this fact, I ask honorable senators not to press the request. </para>

The duties  of  30 per cent. and 50 per cent., even allowing for the exchange adjustment, are almost prohibitive, and I urge the committee to press the request. </para>

                        <para>. -  The Minister mentioned the interesting fact that . 150 employees were engaged in the manufacture  of  rabbit traps. The Government&#39;s attitude regarding these duties is rather surprising. On the one hand we have three firms employing 150 persons, and their factories are situated, I understand, in Sydney. On the other hand, applications for reductions  of  the duties have been received from the Sydney Chamber  of Commerce, the Graziers, Farmers and Settlers, and Retail Traders Associations of New South Wales, the Producers Advisory Council, and the Fruit Growers Federation of New South Wales. Apparently the Government regards the claims of these bodies as deserving of little or no consideration by comparison with the interests of three local manufacturers who have 150 employees, despite the fact, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> recently remarked, that the primary producers are engaged in a battle with the direst opponent that the pastoral and wheat-growing industries have ever encountered. We should not sacrifice the interests of the country people in an attempt to benefit a few men employed in the manufacture of rabbit traps. The Minister&#39;s reply to that is, &#34; This duty will place no burden on the pastoral industry &#34;. I should like to hear him offer that explanation of his present attitude to the members of the Stockowners Association in his own State. I have a very good idea of what their reply would be. He says, further, that the duty will invite competition. What competition? lt is not necessary  to labour this matter. We have to consider whether the interests of about 150 employees in the cities, including possibly a fair proportion of boys and girls, should come before the interests of the whole of the pastoralists in the Commonwealth and the need for destroying, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> has said, one of the most destructive pests in Australia. When I was speaking on this item before, I mentioned also that a large number of unemployed, rather than remain in the cities drawing sustenance allowance,  purchased a few traps and went out into the country districts to earn a little money by catching rabbits. The interests of these people also&#39; are affected by this duty. I can understand a party or an individual standing for a principle; but when it benefits only a handful of people, and is harmful to the interests of thousands of our chief producers, and of a great number of the poorest people in the Commonwealth, the principle becomes a farce. A few years ago I accompanied <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> rabbit-trapper out in the country to see what, he could do. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that the Senate will press its request. The rabbit pest has never been so bad as it is to-day. In Western Australia, rabbits are now a grave menace to all primary producers. Why should pastoralists and farmers who wish to use. British traps be required to pay a duty of 45 per cent, on them, especially when clog traps, and rat and mouse traps are free. Why this discrimination against country people? Why should mouse and rat traps, which are used by householders in the cities, be admitted free from Great Britain, and rabbit traps, which are required to keep clown a pest that is threatening the pastoral industry,&#39; be dutiable at 45 per cent. British and 65 per cent, general? I have a very keen recollection of the debate which took place in this chamber a few weeks ago on this item. On that occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes&#39;s</inline> requested amendment that rabbit traps be free in the British tariff was not accepted by the Government, but it accepted a request, moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> at the suggestion of one of the Ministers, for a duty of 30 per cent. British and 50 per cent, general. Are we to understand that Senate Ministers were overruled when this matter came before Cabinet? I urge them now to support those honorable senators who believe that the Senate&#39;s request should be pressed to display a little backbone for once in tariff matters, and stand up for principles which they advocated on the hustings. The duty on rabbit traps is important, because the rabbit pest is costing the primary producers millions of pounds yearly, and as they have to sell their products in the open market, they should have an opportunity to get their requirements, including rabbit traps, at a reasonable price. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that the Senate will press its request, because rabbit traps are necessary to keep down the pest in all country districts. If they were cheaper, many more of the unemployed would be able to make a living catching rabbits. The reduction of the wool clip this year by approximately 450,000 bales was due, in part, to the increase of rabbits, which ate the sweeter grasses, and to the drought, the combination of which resulted in heavy mortality of sheep and lighter fleeces. If we could get rid of the rabbits, Australia would probably be able to carry another 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 sheep, and the added wealth from the sale of the increased clip would be of enormous advantage to the nation. Despite the high price of wool, sheep are almost unsaleable in many pastoral areas, largely because of t,ho increase of the rabbit pest. I have never seen rabbits more numerous in some districts than they are now, and I regret to state that they are increasing at an alarming rate. As drought conditions are developing in the drier central areas, the rabbits aro moving towards the south, and are eating out all the better grasses. Very few people understand how real is the menace and how important it is that the duty on rabbit traps should be lower. If the duty were abolished altogether rabbit traps would be procurable at a more reasonable price and larger numbers of our unemployed, especially in country districts, would bo able to make a living at trapping rabbits. </para>

                        <para>.- I was pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator johnston</inline> speak so kindly of Senate Ministers a few minutes ago. The improved relations are probably due to the joint meeting of the United Australia party and the Country party this morning. Evidently it was a step in the right direction. In order that this feeling of goodwill between representatives of the parties may continue, I intend to vote with the honorable senator on this item. There is no more justification for imposing a high duty on the traps necessary for the extermination of rabbits, which, as Senator Guthrie has told us, are eating out the richer grasses in all pastoral areas, than there is for putting a duty on <inline font-style="italic">cactoblastus</inline> imported for the destruction of the prickly pear. In recent years, rabbits have taken possession of large areas of pastoral country, and hundreds of nien, who have been thrown out of work, have been trapping rabbits for a living rather than remain iti the cities and larger towns drawing sustenance. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> that we should not place the interests of a small section of the community, such as those employed in the manufacture of rabbit traps, before the interests of the primary producers. Traps should be obtainable at the lowest possible price in order to encourage the destruction of rabbits, which are causing such enormous damage in this country. I trust that the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> will not fall upon deaf ears, and that a majority of honorable senators will insist upon a reduction of duties. </para>

                        <para>. - I anticipated that this moderate request would have been readily accepted by the House of Representatives. To-day, rabbits are destroying not only valuable stock grasses, but also the mulga foliage, upon which cattle sometimes hare to depend, for fodder. When in Central Australia a little while ago I passed through country where miles of mulga scrub had been destroyed by rabbits which, when unable to obtain any other food, climbed the trees and devoured the bark and leaves. During periods of drought in that locality the only stock fodder available is that provided by mulga scrub which in some places has been totally destroyed by rabbits.  Some honorable senators favour the free admission of dog traps, but the damage done by rabbits is infinitely greater than that done by wild dogs.- If dog traps are admitted free from Great Britain, why should we impose a duty of 45 per cent, on rabbit traps? Trappers need at least 100 traps, and, if an unnecessarily high duty is imposed, many men are prevented from earning an honest living. Good rabbit traps are made in Australia, but there is no reason why such a prohibitive duty should be imposed on importations. I shall oppose the motion. </para>

                        <para>. - I should not have spoken on this item but for the extraordinary statement of SenatorFoll, that as no restriction is placed on the introduction of <inline font-style="italic">cactoblastus,</inline> used in the destruction of the prickly pear pest, high protective duties should not be imposed on traps used to combat the rabbit pest. , Surely the honorable senator realizes that the introduction of the <inline font-style="italic">cactoblastus</inline> does not interfere with an Australian industry. It is an insult to our intelligence to contend that the rabbit traps made in Australia are not as good as those produced in Great Britain or elsewhere. This pest can be destroyed by other means than trapping. They can be poisoned or dug out of their warrens, and on one occasion I saw a rabbit-catcher with 40 dogs of various breeds assisting him. The rabbit was introduced from Great Britain 70 years ago, but it is not the only pest we have received from that country. Amongst others are the fox and prickly pear. After years of costly research, it was discovered that the <inline font-style="italic">cactoblastus</inline> was effective for the destruction of prickly pear, which had already covered 30,000,000 acres in Australia. We do not now import supplies of <inline font-style="italic">cactoblastus,</inline> but breed what is required here. </para>

                    <para>We have had the rabbit pest with us for more than 70 years, and, surely, after all that time, we should be able to make our own rabbit traps. I admit that we cannot make battleships or big steamships, or some forms of machinery, but I see no reason why we cannot make rabbit traps. It is a reflection on our intelligence and industry to suggest that we cannot. The fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> knows very little of conditions in the back-blocks of Australia, and I hope that honorable senators will not allow themselves to be impressed by what he says. In this instance, the Senate ought to accept the decision of the House of Representatives, where there are 75 members, many of whom are just as concerned for the welfare of the pastoral industry as are members in this chamber. We should give a full measure of protection to this Australian industry against the products of any other country whatsoever. </para>

                            <para>-  Much as I would like to succeed in the division, I submit that we must follow the usual parliamentary practice. The only question at issue is one of fact. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,have</inline> found as a fact that Senators Payne and Plain were in the chamber before the doors were locked. You can be the only judge of that question of fact, and as you have ruled that the two honorable senators were in the chamber notwithstanding the manner in which they arrived - one of them somewhat precipitately - it hardly seems competent for an honorable senator to dissent from that decision. </para>

                            <para>- The only question to be decided was as to whether the doors were locked for the purpose of taking the division. Obviously they were not locked. Does the word &#34;locked&#34; in Standing Order 171 mean &#34;locked and bolted&#34;? I say that it does. It is my duty to afford to each honorable senator every facility to exercise his vote, and until the doors are locked, every honor able senator has the right to enter this chamber. Ordinarily, the doors of the Senate are closed, and it is impossible for an honorable senator to know whether they are merely closed or locked until he tests them. It is clear that in this case the doors were not locked, and I think that I shall have the support of every honorable senator in saying that Senators Payne and Plain were properly in the chamber and entitled to exercise their votes. DoesSenator Dunn persist in his objection to my ruling? </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators will observe that it has been decided partially to meet the request that the duty under the general tariff on feature films for copying purposes be reduced from1s. to 4d. per lineal foot. The request has been modified to make the duty 8d. a lineal foot. There is little need to recapitulate the whole of the circumstances surrounding this matter, as it was fully discussed when the bill was before the Senate some months ago. I shall, therefore, content myself with stating a few of the salient facts which prompted the Government to decide to adopt the modified rate of 8d. a lineal foot on foreign feature films. The reduction from1s. to  4d. a foot would have involved a loss of revenue to the amount of &#163;76,000. The modified rate of Sd. &#39; will halve this loss, but will return &#163;81,000 less revenue than the average annual collections during the five years ended the 30th- June, 1930, that is, before the rate was increased to 4d. a foot. Although, according to film distributors, rentals fell from &#163;2,095,000 in 1929-30 to &#163;1,391,000 in 1931-32, representing a percentage redaction of 34 per cent., duty collected on films fell from &#163;295,000 t&#169; &#163;57,000 during the same period, a percentage reduction of 81 per cent. The duty collected on cinematograph films during the peak year of 1929-30 represented 14 per cent, of the rentals paid to exhibitors by distributors during that year; but the duty of &#163;96,000, which it is anticipated will be collected at the modified rate of 8d. on. foreign feature film for copying purposes, and 4d. on other foreign film, represents only 7-J per cent, of the film rentals paid during 1932-33. The duty which the film industry is being asked to provide is thus much lower in proportion to film rentals than that paid in 1929-30 before the duty was increased to 4d. a foot. </para>
                    <para>The increase of the duty to 4d in July, 1930, which has been evaded, brought about the exemption from sales tax of film contracts. Besides evading the greater payment which it was anticipated would result from the increase of the duty to 4d. a foot, the distributors have also escaped sales tax which logically should have been paid on the film rentals. The Income Tax Assessment Act of 1930, provides that the taxable income of film distributors shall be deemed to be equivalent to 30 per cent, of the gross rentals received by them, but the  Commisioner  may vary such percentage as he thinks proper. Thus, if owing to the increased duties profits are substantially reduced, relief can be afforded from assessable income to the extent that the duty operates harshly. The extra duty should not result in any appreciable increase of film hire to exhibitors, the reasons being - (1) Film distributors&#39; charges have not been reduced commensurately with the fall in the commodity prices; (2) the easing of the exchange with the United States; (3) the provision in the Income Tax Act for distributors to claim relief from income tax if the duty operates harshly. </para>
                    <para>Even if the whole of the extra duty of 4d. a foot were passed on to exhibitors, the additional charge on the average film which screens for a week in the city would be in the case of city and suburban theatres, 2s. 4fd. for each screening; and in the case of country theatres, <inline font-style="italic">Hid.</inline> for each serening. If a double feature programme were provided, the charges would be 4s. 9d. and ls. lid. respectively. The additional charge would be considerably less on the better class of films which are screened in city theatres for twelve to sixteen weeks and sometimes longer periods. The local film printing industry will still&#34; be adequately protected. The increased preference .accorded to British films in 1930 will be partially restored. I trust that, in view of this explanation, the committee will agree to the compromise. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that the committee will stand by its former decision. During the debate on this item when last it was before this chamber, there were some heated interchanges and references to certain propaganda, it being suggested that much of the information supplied to honorable senators was not strictly accurate. I have carefully examined the situation since then, and I am satisfied that the information then supplied was reliable. The Minister&#39;s remarks to-night applied principally to film corporations and the larger theatres. Many picture theatre proprietors, including one at Launceston and others elsewhere in Tasmania import their own films. A duty of ls. a foot in the general tariff would be ruinous to them. Now it is proposed to make the duty 8d. When this subject was being discussed in the House of Representatives. the Government promised that an investigation would be made into the conditions of the industry. I therefore say that&#39;, pending such investigation, the duty should remain at 4d. a foot. If the inquiry showed that this was not a fair impost, it would be a very simple matter for the Government to table a new schedule of duties in another place, and put the matter right. </para>

                <para>It is, however, in my opinion extremely unlikely that duties on negative films will be increased, as I cannot at the moment see any probability of the production in Australia of films to such an extent that this action would be warranted.

Why alter it now? If Ministers, two months ago, were in favour of a duty of1s. a foot, but now favour a duty of 8d. a foot, may we not be encouraged to hope that, if this committee stands firm, they will agree that 4d. a foot is the correct duty to impose? I am opposed to excessive duties on films which are the principal entertainment of a large proportion of the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - The situation that  has  developed in connexion with the duty on films indicates that a considerable amount of influence has been brought to bear to induce certain honorable senators to change their minds, and to vote for a duty of 8d. a foot on foreign films. It is clear that there has been a good deal of log-rolling, and, like the boy who fell out of the boat, I am &#34; all at sea &#34;. When this item was being discussed in another place, the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> said that, as the result of a compromise with the Senate, the Government had agreed to the duty being fixed at Sd. a foot. I should like to know what senators were parties to that compromise, and what was the text of the messages that passed between the Senate Ministers and their colleagues in the House of Representatives in connexion with this matter. Nothing has been said, so far, to induce me to support the higher duty in the general tariff. &#34;When the duty &#34;on films was under consideration in the House of Representatives, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> said - </para>

                    <para>I am not concerned with making out a case for thu American subsidiary companies engaged in the distribution of films in Australia. They can look after themselves; but I am concerned with the exhibitors and their employees, and with those engaged in printing films in this country. I submit that an increase of the -rate from 4d. to (id. would be fair, in view of the fact that the duty was only 1-Ad. in 1028. It was next increased to 1¾d., and later to 3d. The Seullin Government increased the duty to 4d., and the present Government raised it to ls. The Minister said that he was anxious to help the industry, and that the Government proposed to give money prizes with this end in view. </para>
                    <para>I hold no brief for the American distributing companies.

Rather would I. stress the fact that picture shows are the chief entertainment of the poorer sections of the community, and that we should not make it more difficult for them to have this enjoy ment.

                    <para class="block">The House of Representatives has accepted the Senate&#39;s request that the British preferential rate on manufactured stationery, including letter clips, papers ruled or bordered with water lines, or likewise, date cases, ink bottles, ink wells, ink stands, paper knives, memorandum slates and tablets, sealing and bottling wax, Christmas cards, &#38;c., book markers, writing desks, not being furniture, writing cases, paper binders, card hangers, pen racks and bookbinders&#39; staples, be reduced to 30 per cent., but has declined to reduce the duty on bill and box files, date cards, albums of all kinds, cards and booklets, namely, printers&#39;, menu and similar kinds, stationery cases, including note paper, and/or boxed envelopes, packed or in compendiums and the like. In moving the request, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> contended that many of the articles covered by item 340 a, for example, ink wells, memorandum slates and tablets, sealing and bottling wax and writing cases, did not come into competition with the products of Australian industries, and that the high duties, therefore, consti tuted an additional burden on the community. The Government has considered the request, and proposes a modification, because the Tariff Board, in a report dated October, 1930, recommended that on item 340 a 1 the duties should be,ad valorem, British 30 per cent., general 40 per cent., and on item 340 a 2, ad valorem, British 45 per cent. and general 55 per cent. The modified rates follow the board&#39;s recommendation, except for an adjustment of the general tariff rate to provide for the existing margin of preference under the Ottawa agreement. The evidence tendered at the Tariff Board&#39;s inquiry related principally to note paper and envelopes, boxed, packed or in compendiums, but the board considered that the local manufacturers were entitled to increased protection on all the goods covered by paragraph 2 of sub-item a. The request, as modified, gives effect to lower duties on those goods referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> as well as on many other kinds of stationery, and, at the same time, is in accord with the Government&#39;s policy of following, in broad principle, the recommendations of the Tariff Board. </para>

                        <para>.- It is gratifying to learn that the House of Representatives recognizedthe fairness of my submission, and has agreed in part to the request. When I was speaking to the request, I did not think it necessary to mention every article covered by the item, but now I find that the Senate&#39;s request has been agreed to in respect of those items which I mentioned, but on those which I did not mention, the higher duties still remain. My arguments in favour of reduced duties applied equally to the articles I did not mention as to those I did. They applied particularly to boxed stationery, &#38;c., because the importation of such goods necessarily entails heavy freight charges. For that reason, I believe that a duty of 20 per cent. British, in addition to the natural protection which such goods enjoy, should be sufficient to safeguard the local industry. I can well understand the House of Representatives agreeing to the request to reduce the duties on Christmas cards, because quite  90  per cent. of the cards used in Australia have to be imported. </para>

                    <para>Unless it was shown that something was being done to prejudice the revenue, there was no justification for the heavy increase of the duty under this item. An importer, desirous of increasing the sale of a certain article in Australia, who arranges with the manufacturer to print on it words indicating that it had been specially imported by that importer, should not be penalized. The principle goods covered by the item are earthenware articles, glassware, pencils, pens, smoking requisites, cinematograph films - other than dramatic - thermometers, fancy goods, and penknives. The request was acceded to with the modification that the general tariff rate be reduced to 42&#189; per cent. in order that the margin of preference may conform with the formula set down in the Ottawa agreement. Any reasons for the reduction of the British preferential rate apply with equal force to the general tariff rate. The bulk of these goods come from foreign countries, and there is no sound reason for allowing such a wide margin of preference as 40 per cent. The total loss of revenue, if both British preferential tariff and general tariff rates were reduced, would be on the basis of the 1931-32 figures, &#163;809, but possibly, the reduced rates would stimulate importations and obviate any loss. The margin of preference required under the Ottawa agreement formula is accorded, and no objection should be taken to the modification. </para>

                        <para>. - I oppose the amendment. We have witnessed the&#39; extraordinary spectacleof the Minister in charge of the bill, who is also Acting Leader of the Senate, moving the adoption of the report, and one of his colleagues submitting an amendment to the motion, in order that the message from the House of Representatives may be recommitted for the purpose of reversing a decision given by the Senate on two previous occasions regarding the duties on galvanized iron. The Government might at least have given reasonable notice to members of the Country party, particularly in view of the desire expressed and shown earlier in the day, at a combined meeting of the United Australia and Country parties, for better working arrangements between them. I did not know that the recommittal of the message was contemplated until I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> a few momenta ago, address remarks to members of the Ministry. Apparently the Lang Labour party has the confidence of the Government, but members of the Country party may not have notice of the Government&#39;s intentions in matters of this kind. </para>

                            <para>- If the Government had accepted the decision  made several days ago, the House of Representatives probably would have been willing to compromise on the galvanized iron duties, as it did on the films duties. In my 4&#189; years&#39; experience in this Parliament, governments have always accepted the decisions of one chamber and forwarded them to the other. When the Scullin Government was in power, the Senate made decisions in opposition to it, but, on no occasion did the Ministry adopt the procedure that is now being followed. That Government had only a small band of supporters here. </para>

Certainly the majority of the electors desire that galvanized iron shall be admitted free. I have no doubt that the Government, which so frequently changes its mind, as it did in regard to the film duties, could be induced to meet the Senate half-way in respect of the duties on galvanized iron if the Senate adheres to its twice repeated request for a lower rate. </para>

                            <para>- I respectfully suggest that no point of order is involved because, in this matter, the Senate is following established precedent. I take it that honorable senators generally are desirous that the true opinion of the Senate should be taken on every subject brought before it. The item affected by request number 13 would not have been decided in the first place, as it was, but. for the unfortunate absence, through a misunderstanding, of one honorable senator who would have voted with the Government. When the item was next before this chamber, the decision to press the request was made in a thin Senate. If the request is recommitted, the item will be open for discussion and we shall get a vote that will more correctly represent the views of this chamber. </para>

                    <para>My interpretation of the standing order is that the message from another place is part of the bill, and, as such, it may be recommitted. If there were not this power to recommit, the Senate would be placed in a very awkward position. If, for instance, it were thought that a true expression of opinion on a bill or message could be recorded in a fuller Senate, and it were not competent to move for its recommittal, the voice of the chamber would be stifled. Accordingly, I rule that the amendment moved by the Assistant Treasurer is in order. </para>

I did not anticipate that we would pass these tariff items without a struggle, and I know, from a lengthy parliamentary experience, that whenever a Minister is defeated on a tariff item, he considers it his duty to move for its recommittal and further consideration if he believes that there is a prospect of the vote being reversed. Had I been in the Minister&#39;s place to-night, I would have moved for the recommittal of the message to consider the item in question. But, while I agree that the Government is merely doing what any government would do in the circumstances, I shall do all in my power to prevent the recommittal of the message for the consideration of the duties on galvanized iron, and will stand by the previous decision of the committee. </para>

                        had formed some sort of a coalition with the Government in order to secure the recommittal of the message for the further consideration of the duty on galvanized iron; but I was pleased to hear the honorable senator say that he accepted the assurance of my colleague that his remark to the Minister in charge of the bill was made in a jocular way. Lang party senators in this chamber, and&#39; in another place, pay very little attention to criticism from any other political party. I would have been surprised if the Government had not moved for the recommittal of the message, and I am entitled to assume that, if an understanding has been arrived at, it was the result of a joint meeting of the United Australia and United Country parties in regard to the wheat problem thi3 morning. I intend to vote with the Government on this issue, because I believe in doing everything possible to give adequate protection to Australian industries. The industry affected by the item which the Government seeks to have recommitted gives employment to many thousands of- people in the Newcastle district, and distributes in wages about &#163;8,000 weekly. I am just as much concerned as is
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline>
                        about the welfare of the primary producers. I have had some experience of primary industry. Earlier in my life I was employed on farms, and, I may add, I never worked harder in my life. If

But we are now dealing with an exceptional matter - a message which has been received from the House of Representatives with reference to certain amendments <inline font-style="italic">to the</inline> tariff schedule requested by the Senate. Therefore, with great respect, I submit that that passage in the Standing Orders dealing with the report stage, upon which you, sir, relied, can be relevant only by analogy, and is not directly associated with the point we are now considering. The amendment moved by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Lawson)</inline> is that .the message be recommitted for the purpose of reconsidering one of the principal requested amendments. I do not know whether or not that involves two questions - first, whether the bill be recommitted, and, secondly, that it be recommitted for the purpose of reconsidering a particular request. I submit that we cannot reconsider this particular request to-night. No resolution, whether of a club, an association, or a legislative chamber, can , be rescinded, unless the proper forms are observed. Standing Order  No. 134 reads - </para>

If we wish to rescind a step deliberately taken by the Senate - and what applies to the Senate applies to a committee of the whole - we must do so according to prescribed forms. </para>

I do not object to the formal motion for recommittal, but I do oppose the proposal to rescind a decision of the committee duly arrived at without giving to honorable senators an opportunity to be present and say whether or not they desire to recant their votes. &#34;We will assume that when the decision was arrived at, it was the considered opinion of a reasonably full Senate. If what is proposed can be done, the Government could, at any time, with a vigilant Whip, take due regard to the state of the House or of the committee, and move for a recommittal when the attendance was thin, and a decision arrived at in a full committee could be upset by a committee in which barely a quorum was present.

                    <para class="block">Standing Orders were framed to prevent that. While I do not object to the recommittal, I dissent from the view that the message should be recommitted for the purpose of reconsidering any particular request that has already been considered, unless proper notice is given, so that honorable senators may attend. Of course, the rules of this chamber are modelled upon those of other parliaments in Australia and in Great Britain, but whatever necessity there may be in the parliaments of the various States of Australia, or in the Mother of Parliaments, for proceeding in an orderly manner with respect to rescinding a resolution, the necessity is much stronger in a parliament such as this. Australia is a country of great spaces, and doubtless the provision in the Standing Orders requiring that seven days&#39; notice of a proposed rescission shall be given was inserted with the knowledge that it is impossible for many senators to attend here at short notice. It will be seen that to correct irregularities or mistakes one day&#39;s notice is sufficient, in other cases seven days&#39; notice is necessary, and at least half of the total number of senators must vote for the rescission. Standing Order 134 is intended to prevent anything being undone without proper notice being given. While I do not object to the first portion of the motion, I do object to theitem being recommitted for the purpose of reconsidering a decision already reached. </para>

It may say that the request shall be pressed or that it shall not, be pressed; that the modification be agreed to or that it be not agreed to; or that some other modification of the original request be made. The committee having come to a decision, the  Chairman,  in accordance with Standing Order 257, notifies the Senate of the resolution. In Standing Order 212, which deals with tin; recommittal of bills - a totally different subject - it is provided that the resolution of the committee shall come before the Senate on a motion for the adoption of the report.

                            <para>- If that is so, then Standing Order 212 also was suspended, and the Minister is not able to rely upon it. The Minister says that the Standing Orders have been suspended on a motion moved by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> I maintain that they have not been suspended. The contingent notice- of motion reads that so much of the Standing Orders may be suspended as would permit the message being at once dealt with, and all consequent action taken. The obvious intention is that, immediately upon the Standing Orders being so suspended, the particular matter is to be considered and dealt with forthwith. The fact is, of course, that, in this particular instance, the bill was not dealt with forthwith. Half a dozen bills have been considered since the Standing Orders were suspended to enable this bill to be dealt with. I maintain that, as soon as any other bill intervened, the suspension of Standing Orders in respect of this one automatically lapsed. If the Standing Order does not mean what I say, why were the words &#34;at once&#34; included in the motion for suspension? </para>

                            <para>- Even on the reading of this standing order, the Minister&#39;s case has broken down. But I do not think that the Standing Orders have been suspended. The whole procedure to be followed in connexion with a money bill is clearly set out in its own compartment of the Standing Orders, namely, Nos. 255 to 257. I emphasize one aspect at which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> hinted. It is unusual for the House of Representatives to decline to accept a request of this chamber and for the Senate to press it a second time. What might be a reasonable thing to do when a bill was first before this chamber would be an extraordinary thing to do when the bill was before us a second time. The attempt of the Ministry to smuggle this item through in the absence of certain honorable senators who have had no notice of the Government&#39;s intention appears to be unusual, to say the least. I admit that the Government is acting within its legal rights, if its action is in accord with the Standing Orders. But the Senate having resolved to press its request, it seems injudicious to attempt, by a hasty vote, to prevent its considered and reiterated decision from being sent back to the other chamber. </para>

                            <para>- I do not share the view that has been advanced by the honorable senator. The practice that is now being followed is not without precedent. Precisely similar action was taken in 1921 in connexion with the customs tariff. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> D. Millen proposed &#34; That the report be adopted &#34;, an amendment was submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> his colleague, that the message be resubmitted for the reconsideration of certain requests, and the recommittal was agreed to. This practice has been followed on subsequent occasions, and I believe that it was adopted prior to 1921. </para>

                            <para>- The original point of order taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> was that the recommittal of the message could not take place until certain formalities had been observed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes,</inline> in supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> contended that bills which the Senate may not amend were to bo treated according to theprocedure laid down in. Standing Orders 251 to 258. I point out that these bills are subject, not only to those standing orders, but also to others in Chapter XIX. which deals with public bills. Returning to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan&#39;s</inline> contention, it is true that if the Standing Orders had not been suspended the bill would have to be passed through its various stages at such intervals as would allow adequate time for honorable senators to express their views upon it. But provision is made for the Standing Orders to be suspended on special occasions for the purpose of enabling a bill to be passed through all its stages without delay. A motion for such suspension can be carried only by an absolute majority of the Senate unless notice of motion has been given. The Minister gave the required notice in this case, and a simple majority was sufficient to carry the motion. For the purposes of the consideration of this bill the Standing Orders are already suspended, and the suspension will operate until the bill is either passed or rejected. I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> has placed a wrong construction upon Standing Order 134. He said that a proposal for the recommittal of the bill is not in order until certain formalities provided in that standing order have been complied with, but I call attention to the fact that the standing order refers to &#34; an order, resolution, or other vote of the Senate.&#34; There is no reference to a report from the committee. Therefore, this standing order does not apply in the present case. The Minister properly cited precedents and he promptedme to go further afield and find out the practice in the Mother of Parliaments. I draw attention to a marginal note on page 494 of the twelfth edition of <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> &#34; consideration of reports from Committees of Supply andWays and Means &#34; and the following passage on page 495 :  - </para>

I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> that we should not lightly limit our own freedom. If we decided that at this stage we should not in any circumstances recommit a message or bill received from the other chamber, we should definitely limit the legislative powers of the Senate. If the Senate approves of such a limitation it must of course accept responsibility for it; but my ruling is that the procedure now being adopted by the Minister is in order. </para>

                            <para>-  Surely a committee of the whole Senate must always be the same committee. I must accept your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that this is not the same committee, but I must add that had you not said so, I should not have reached that conclusion with my own unaided intelligence. I am raising this matter, not merely with the object of delaying the committee, but it appears to me that we may be establishing a precedent, and may be laying down a practice which may be used to limit, if not to destroy, the rights which we possess. The opinion of the Senate, or of a committee of the whole, may be obtained by a deliberate vote, but at some future time, a member less conscientious than the present Minister, noticing the state of the committee, may upset a decision deliberately arrived at. If that is allowed, the Government may, when some honorable senators who previously voted are hundreds of miles away, and unable to return in time to vote, submit a motion nullifying that which the committee did perhaps two days before. </para>

                        <para>.- I am afraid that some honorable senators who are prejudiced, may feel that they cannot give to the Government&#39;s proposal the sympathetic consideration it deserves. Honorable senators should remember that the galvanized iron industry is essential to Australia, for both commercial and national reasons. The Australian producers of galvanized iron have given satisfactory service to the people of Australia, by supplying a commodity of  good  quality at a price which commends itself  to the Australian public. The first alternative suggested by the Tariff Board was punitive in character, and the second, which provides for a reduction of price, should be acceptable to the users of galvanized iron. In these circumstances, those honorable senators who favour lower duties, should admit that the Government&#39;s proposals are reasonable, and that as the Tariff Board is policing this industry, the Australian public is not likely to be detrimentally affected. At times, I too have criticized this industry, tut honorable senators should not allow prejudice to influence them in the vote which they will shortly record. Having regard to the value which this industry is to Australia, and the report of the Tariff Board regarding it, I do not see how the Government can possibly give way on this item. The Government does not desire to take advantage of the absence of honorable senators, but now that the strength of the committee has been increased, I believe that the vote taken to-night will be truly indicative of the opinion of the committee. </para>

                        <para>. - On two previous occasions, the duties on galvanized iron have been debated at length, and when a vote was last taken, the committee decided to request the House of Representatives to reduce the British preferential duty from 90s. to 20s. a ton. That request has been returned from another place, and the Minister who has moved that it be not pressed has not given any reasons why the  committee  should reverse the vote previously recorded. I am surprised that those who profess to represent the workers of Australia in this chamber should favour the imposition of a high duty, which will increase the &#39;cost of galvanized iron used for constructing the cheaper types of dwelling, and for many other purples.. Those who occupy the more expansive dwellings use tiles and slates for roofing purposes, but workers in the big cities and in country districts are compelled to use galvanized iron extensively. This commodity, which now costs &#163;23 10s. a ton, is also used by primary producers, in the construction of dwellings, wool sheds, milking sheds, barns and other farm improvements. We <inline font-style="italic">have</inline> been told over and over again that galvanized iron is obtainable at a cheaper rate in Australia than it is in <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> Zealand, where it is admitted free of duty. That is an inaccurate statement. </para>

In New South Wales the power of Lysaght Limited is apparently so great that it is able to induce the Railways Department to grant to it specially favorable freight rates. If I use British galvanized iron en my farm in the Riverina, I have to pay &#163;2 a ton more in freight for bringing the iron from Newcastle than if I buy Australian galvanized iron. That does not seem, to be in accordance with either the spirit or the letter of the Ottawa .  agreement.  It is scandalous that the New South Wales Railways Department, should charge a higher freight on British than on Australian iron. It shows what power is possessed by this monopolistic firm. </para>

                            <para>- It is disgraceful. Every primary producer and worker from Cape York to Tasmania uses galvanized iron, and we know what difficult times the workers are passing through jUSt now. The primary producers also have tremendous difficulties, as we know only too well. It seems remarkable therefore, that the Government should be attempting to make galvanized iron still dearer, instead of doing whatever it can to make it cheap. </para>

I have listened to. all his speeches. and I cannot agree with him. When this matter was first debated, we who opposed the duties proposed by the Government had a majority of one.

                        <para>The Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act 1922-29 authorizes payment of bounty at the rate of &#163;4 10s. per ton on galvanized sheets manufactured in Australia, and delivered from the factory on and after 1st January. 1930. Section 3 of the act cited provides that on the introduction of a customs tariff bringing into operation increased duties on galvanized iron the rate of bounty shall be decreased by an amount which, in the opinion of the Minister, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, corresponds to the amount by which the duties are increased. At the present time no bounty is payable, because of the operation of Tariff Resolution of 3rd May, 1932, increasing the duties by &#163;4 10s. per ton. </para>

                    <para class="block">In other words, when the duty was increased to &#163;4 10s. a ton the bounty automatically became inoperative. The law provides that, if the duty is reduced, the bounty may be correspondingly raised, even though Parliament is not sitting at the time. If the Government thinks that the industry should be assisted - and for the moment I do not argue against it - that assistance should be given by the whole community in the form of a bounty, so that we may know just what it is costing us. I strenuously oppose the action of the Government in seeking to retain a duty of &#163;4 10s. a ton, because the burden of assisting the industry under that system falls entirely on the users, who are chiefly the workers and primary producers. The heavy duty operates chiefly against Great Britain, from which country most of our iron, whether flat or corrugated, has been imported. We have hoard much of the Ottawa agreement, and here is an opportunity for us to show our bona fides by reducing the duty on British iron. The Tariff Board&#39;s report sets out as follows the imports of galvanized iron, plain and sheet, into Australia from various countries, for the four years ended 30th June, 1931- </para>
                    <para class="block">The reason why no importations were made in  1930-31  from countries other than the United Kingdom is that they were prohibited by customs proclamation from the  3rd  October,  1930,  until the 6th May,  1931.  This restriction directed a serious blow at British trade, yet we have heard people prating about the way in which the Government is giving effect to the Ottawa agreement. </para>

Until the Minister brought this motion forward, we were not aware of the form which it would take, but we  now  find that it consists of a resubmission of the original motion which the Senate refused to pass. I am told that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy,</inline> who is ill and has a month&#39;s leave of absence, has informed a member of the committee that he desires a pair. Will a pair be given to him? Is it a fact that the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> who, I understand, has gone to Melbourne to-night, is paired with an honorable senator on this side who is in Canberra at the present time? Tomorrow possibly the billwill again be recommitted to enable the duties on dates, sprays or rabbit traps to be reconsidered. However the measure is in its final stages, and the Government has had to rely practically throughout on the votes of the Labour Opposition. The time may come when Labour senators will not be so docile, and so ready to give their support to the Government; and when Ministers may once more desire the support of senators of their own party. </para>

Although the whole of the people are vitally affected by the duty on galvanized iron, only two persons, both representing the same firm, appeared before the board to give evidence in. support of the higher duty. Those who gave evidence in support of reduction of the dutywere Walter Corries Cambridge, general secretary, Farmers and Settlers Association,7 O&#39;Connellstreet, Sydney; Sydney Linden Officer, secretary of the Graziers Association of Victoria, and the Graziers Association of Southern Riverina, Melbourne; Norman William Hutchinson,  president  of the Australian Association of British Manufacturers, and manager in Australia of Nielson and Maxwell Limited, iron and steel merchants, London, Glasgow, Melbourne, Sydney and New Zealand; Reginald Dines Westmore, on behalf of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, and secretary of the Joint Committee for Tariff Revision, expressing the views of the Graziers Association of New South Wales, the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales, and the Fruit-growers Federation of New South Wales; Norman Lee Rigg, trading as N. L. Ragg, seller of galvanized iron, Melbourne. It was, of course, quite right that the Association of British Manufacturers should be represented before the board because, if we had a reasonable tariff, Ave should be importing large quantities of galvanized iron from the Mother Country. As the committee has on two occasions decided that the British duty on galvanized iron shall be &#163;1 a ton, its decision should stand. Honorable senators should not accept the Government&#39;s proposal to give higher protection to this selfish, monopolistic combine that wants the whole of the Australian market in order to extract higher profits from the whole of the primary industries. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> is. prevented, by illness, from taking part in this debate, because I am sure that he would have been able to advance strong arguments in favour of the lower duty. When  this subject was last debated, he mentioned the difficulty experienced by reputable hardware merchants in securing supplies of Australian galvanized iron from the combine. Regarding the prices charged for steel sheet bars, evidence was given by William Roy Coles, representing Broken Hill Proprietary Limited, iron and steel masters, Melbourne. Cannot honorable senators see the hand of the combine in so much of the evidence that was given before the board? The Broken Hill Proprietary Limited and Lysaght Limited have interests in common: WhenI visited the Newcastle Steel Works a few months ago, I did not notice any boundary between the properties of the two companies. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Essington</inline> Lewis, the general manager of Broken Hill Proprietary Limited, is a director of Lysaght Limited, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lysaght</inline> is a director of Broken Hill Proprietary Limited. Therefore, it was not surprising that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles,</inline> representing the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited should appear before the board to say a few words in support of the request by Lysaght&#39;s Limited for higher duties. Regarding the wages paid in the galvanized iron industry, evidence was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Hopkins, iron worker, employed at the worm of John Lysaght Limited. </para>

TheChamber of Mines, primary producers, and the wheatgrow ers&#39; associations of that State, as well as the chambers of commerce, are behind me in my protest against a reversal of the Senate&#39;s decision with respect to this item. They object to the primary industries being forced to pay tribute to this Newcastle monopoly, and also to the imposition of a duty of &#163;4 10s. a ton on British iron. The committee is further handicapped in dealing with this item because the board&#39;s report contains no summary of the valuable evidence given by the witnesses whose names I have given. </para>

With the aid of the Lang Labour party, the Government has secured a victory against the majority of its own party, and the members of the Country party owing to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was given a &#34;live&#34; pair, while a member of the Country party, who is absent on sick leave, was refused that privilege.

                        <para>. -  I enter my strong protest against the manner in which this matter has been disposed of. Some time ago, when fighting for tariff reduction, we said, &#34; Thank God that we have a Government which will give us a tariff policy for which we have been fighting so strenuously for years&#34;. In these circumstances,I expected that when a clear expression of opinion was given on two occasions in favour of a reduction of duty, the Government would have accepted that decision us the considered opinion of this chamber, and abided by it. I am bitterly disappointed with what has taken place . I could say a good deal more, but I feel that that is all I dare say. </para>

In the absence of any notification that an honorable senator wished to move an amendment, I naturally thought that no amendments were to be moved. If it is thought that I submitted the motion with undue haste, I regret it. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret that the report on the tobacco industry, which the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> has just tabled, has not been made available to honorable senators until this late hour, in view of the fact that we were given an assurance yesterday that it would be at our disposal early today. My principal objection, however, is that extracts from the report, which is of particular interest to honorable senators representing Queensland and New South Wales, have already been published in certain evening newspapers before honorable senators have even seen it. As the report may have a far-reaching effect upon the tobacco-growing industry, it was the duty of the Government to make it available to members of this Parliament before the newspapers had access to it. </para>

                <para class="block">The Government, and Government departments, ought at least to try to couch official publications in correct English. It is not correct to call the natives of Australia aboriginals; they are aborigines. The word &#34; aboriginal &#34; is an adjective, while &#34; aborigines &#34; is a noun. While I do not desire to pose as a grammatical purist, I think that some regard could be paid to the rules of grammar. We are setting a bad example when the intellectual giants of our governmental institutions show that they are unable to distinguish between a noun and an adjective. I trust that more care will be exercised in these matters in the future. </para>

                    <para>- It is the practice with documents of this kind, which it is desired to publish simultaneously all over Australia in centres as far apart as Brisbane, Hobart, Launceston, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth, to send copies under seal to the newspaper offices sometimes weeks before the date on which they are to be released, so that the journals may bring out a complete story on the specified date. So far as I know, that confidence has never before been abused. In this case, one pressman unfortunately did abuse the privilege, but I understand that he has since expressed his regret for what he did. I assure honorable senators that it was my intention to place the report on the table of the Senate at the same time as it was tabled in the House of Representatives by the Acting Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham).</inline> There was some delay, and in the meantime certain newspapers in the capital cities published a summary of the report. I wish to distinguish between what was published by them yesterday, and what appeared on a previous occasion, purporting to be a summary of the report. The Government will be very watchful of these matters in the future. </para>
