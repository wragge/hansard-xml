For instance, treasury-bills for government finance in the last two years have increased by &#163;37,000,000, and the rate of discount has been reduced from6 to 2&#189; per cent. Fixed deposit and other rates of interest have also been materially reduced.

                            <para>- Even if it were made to growers in only one centre, or even to only one grower, the fact that such a promise was made causes some doubt as to whether the inquiry by the Tariff Board on which the Government acted examined all phases of the tobacco-growing industry. Is it suggested that we should finally agree to these duties when the Prime Minister has already arranged for a further inquiry to determine whether the growers are receiving fair treatment? There must be some foundation for the assertions that have been made. The Tariff Board stated that if the industry was not to be handicapped the total gross revenue to be received by the Government should not exceed &#163;6,500,000. What revenue has been secured?For the firstnine months of the financial year the revenue collected amounted to &#163;400,000 in excess of the estimate, and if collection for the remaining three months is in the same ratio, the total excess of revenue received in the form of excise and customs duties, will be &#163;7,120,000, or practically &#163;600,000 in excess of the estimate. As the estimate is so far astray, the committee is justified in now postponing the consideration of these duties until a further report has been received. I do not favour an increase in duty; and I have already informed the committee that I will support lower excise duties. The exportation of tobacco has been lightly dismissed by those who have spoken on behalf of the tobacco-growers as something that is probably not worth considering. I have already pointed out its national importance, and have also referred to the American balances. I do not think that the committee is aware of the exact nature of the preferences that have already been extended by the United Kingdom. It is stated in the Economic Committee&#39;s report that - </para>

                        <para>Preferences on Empire tobacco were accorded in September, 1919, by the granting of a rebate of one-sixth of the full rate of import duty. At the time this represented an advantage of 1s. and1s. 4 5-12th of a penny per lb. In July, 1925, the rebate was increased by 50 per cent, to one-fourth of the full rate, or 2s. </para>

                    <para class="block">Who can say that Australia will never have an export trade in tobacco? The United Kingdom is the world&#39;s biggest importer of tobacco, yet only a small proportion of its importation comes from Empire sources. Most of the tobacco imported into Great Britain comes from North America. In 1921, Empire producers supplied 3.3 per cent, of the tobacco consumed in the United Kingdom, compared with 94.3 per cent, from the United States of America, and 2.4 per cent, from other foreign countries. In the following year &#39;the proportions were respectively 6.8 per cent., 90.2 per cent., and 3 per cent. Those proportions were maintained practically unaltered until 1927, after which the supplies of tobacco from Empire sources steadily declined, notwithstanding the preference, while the supplies from American sources steadily increased. In 1928, Great Britain imported from Empire sources 19.7 per cent, of her tobacco requirements.; in the following year 13.1 per cent., and in 1930 - the latest year for which I have been able to obtain figures - 14.9 per cent. The importations of tobacco into Great Britain from the United States of America in 1928, 1929, and 1930 were respectively 79 per cent., 85.6 per cent., and 83.5 per cent. When we reflect that the United Kingdom buys tobacco to thu value of about &#163;15,000,000 each year, and that that country has imposed a duty of 9s. 6d. per lb. on tobacco, it will be seen &#39; that there is ample scope for th&#187; development of an export trade in tobacco from Australia. The Government has in hand &#163;600,000, which it . has taken from the consumers of tobacco, and I suggest that it should expend that money in obtaining additional preferences from England. </para>

The postponement of the sub-items would enable the investigation promised by the Prime Minister to be conducted ; it would reveal the possibility of developing an export trade in tobacco, and would prove the truth or otherwise of the charge that the reduction of the -import duty has inflicted hardship on the tobacco-growing, industry in this country. The motion for postponement should have the support of every honorable senator who has the interests of the tobacco-growers at heart. </para>

                        <para>. - The development of an export trade in tobacco, which may happen in the dim future, if at all, has nothing to do with the question under discussion. This belated motion for the postponement of the sub-items, which might well have &#39;been, moved before we embarked on yesterday&#39;s discussion, does not appeal to me, because it rests on no solid ground whatever. The Prime Minister could have told the tobacco-growers at Mareeba that on the 30th October, 1931, the then Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> referred the duties on tobacco to the Tariff Board for investigation and report, and that the board&#39;s report was .not furnished until &#39;the 3rd February in the following year. An examination of the names of the persons who gave evidence before the Tariff Board shows that one of the witnesses was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Leon</inline> Macintosh Ellis, a tobacco-grower of Mareeba, Queensland. The Mareeba growers had ample time- to place their case before the Tariff Board. Advices which I have received, as we&#93;l as press reports and telegrams, indicate clearly that the inquiry promised by the Prime Minister had reference only to the Mareeba district. The Mareeba growers complained that they had only 28 hours in which to prepare their case for the Tariff Board, whereas, in fact, they had all the time which I have indicated. The Prime Minister told the people at Mareeba, who complained that the tobacco-manufacturing companies had refused to buy useful tobacco, that their complaint would probably be referred to the Tariff Board, and also that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Howell</inline> would undertake an investigation into the conditions existing at Mareeba. For the reasons which I explained yesterday, the conditions existing at Mareeba are not encouraging. The conditions there differ from those which prevail at other centres. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> told his audience that he was concerned about the position of the unfortunate people at Mareeba, and that he would arrange for an immediate investigation of their case, but that he could not permit another inquiry into the tobacco industry as a whole. I do not, know what special difficulties exist at Mareeba; but I understand that leaf spot has made its appearance there. This subject has been fully debated from every angle, and there is no justification for postponing the subitems merely because a further investigation is to be made into the conditions existing at one centre. The trouble at Mareeba has no bearing on the tobacco growing industry in Victoria, South Australia, and other places, where the growers have not complained of having been given no proper opportunity to present their case to the Tariff Board. The committee should reject the motion for postponement. The action of the honorable senator is an afterthought - something which the French call staircase wit. </para>

Agricultural Society in ordering the removal of that sign clearly shows that there is a sinister influence at work with a view to undermining the Australian tobacco-growing industry. Although I am not a smoker, I do nol begrudge a smoke to any of my fellow citizens, but I do object to the use of insidious propaganda to the effect that there is something wrong with the Australian-grown product. In New South Wales, a large quantity of leaf is grown at Tumut and in New England district and at other places, but there is no reason why large areas of low grade land in that State should not be  used for tobacco cultivation. In Tasmania, along the Derwent Valley, tobacco-growing is largely taking . the place of hop-growing. In Victoria, this product is grown in the Ovens district and in the Goulburn Valley. In Queensland, it is grown at Mareeba and other places. I do not know whether tobacco is produced: in South Australia or Western Australia, but I suggest to honorable senators that, in the interest of the growers generally, this item should be postponed until the Government decides upon a definite policy for the assistance of the tobacco-growers. I am prepared to give the growers a protection of 100 per cent. </para>

                        <para>.- I regret that I cannot support the motion. A definite opportunity for the friends of this industry to display, in a practical way, their sympathy with it was furnished by my request, on which a vote has just been taken. This appears to be merely camouflage, to endeavour to make outsiders believe that something is being done on behalf of the tobacco growers. I trust that the promise of the Prime Minister to representatives of the tobacco-growers in Queensland will be honoured. </para>

                        <para>.- I agree with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> is endeavouring to camouflage the vote that he recorded earlier in the afternoon, by making it appear that he is attempting to help the tobacco-growers in the Riverina and other parts of New South Wales. Yet I do not believe that the promise of the Prime Minister bears the interpretation placed on it by the Minister, that no matter what may be the result of the proposed investigation, the policy of the Government will not be altered. If that were the case, of what use would be the investigation? Representatives of one of the most important sections of the tobacco industry in Queensland told the right honorable gentleman that they had not been given the opportunity enjoyed by other sections to place their case before the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I can only assume that the Tariff Board did not prosecute it&#39;s inquiries sufficiently far afield to enable these growers to present their case. It is apparent that that fact was recognized by the Prime Minister. I cannot believe that he intends that in no circumstances will the policy of the Government be altered. But, in any event, I cannot see what is to be gained by the postponement of the sub-items. It is hoped that the whole of the tariff schedule will be completed within the next two weeks; and it would be quite impossible to obtain the additional information required before the expiry of that period. I do not propose to. fall for any of the sly tricks of the &#34; Cromwell of the Riverina &#34;, as he is described by his opponents. The promised investigation can be held before the House of Representatives again has the tariff before it. </para>

That honorable senator declined to assist the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> to carry a request that would have given substantial protection to the Australian tobacco industry. According to the Townsville <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> a very reliable newspaper, the Prime Minister admitted that the fact that the Tariff Board had not visited Mareeba was unsatisfactory, and said, &#34; The board should investigate the position at Mareeba again, to get at the facts. I guarantee that an independent investigation will be made &#34;. In my opinion, the interpretation to be placed on those words is that action will be taken if the. investigation support&#39;s the contention of the Mareeba tobacco-growers. </para>

                            <para>-  I am endeavouring to do that. I cannot see what is to be gained by the postponement of the sub-items until the end of the schedule, because the result of the investigation could not by then be known, and we should be no further advanced. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> is anxious to make the retention of the present import duties contingent on the adoption of the Country party&#39;s pet idea of the reduction of the excise duty by 8d. per lb. As it would appear, however, that he is not disposed to reveal what is in his mind, I intend to oppose the motion, from which no good could come. He did not give practical expression to his solicitude for the industry when the opportunity to do so was afforded to him. The most important -sentence in the telegram from the Cairns Chamber of Commerce reads, &#34; The present duty enables the manufacturer to import lower grades at advantage over Australian leaf &#34;. That means that a great deal more tobacco will be imported. </para>

                        <para>. -  My original intention was to move for the postponement of the item, but you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> require me to suggest a definite time for its consideration. Could not the committee postpone its consideration until shortly before the  1/hj.rd  reading of the bill? An effort will be made in this chamber to recommit the whole of the schedule, because certain honorable senators believe that a report by the Tariff Board, which the Government is withholding from us, contains certain information regarding a reduction of duties. Therefore, what is to prevent the postponement of the consideration of this item until the day before the motion for the third reading of the bill is submitted? One, two, or even three months may elapse before this committee reassembles after the approaching recess, and if honorable members in another place follow the usual practice, they will not take more than  24  hours to consider our requested amendments. Immediately afterwards, we could deal with the motion for the third reading of the bill.  In  view of the promise of the Prime Minister, which the Minister in charge of the hill interprets in one way, and on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> places a different construction, because he said that he understood there was to be a general investigation of the position of the industry- </para>

When the price was 2s. 3d. per lb., the Mareeba growers were absolutely satisfied. An expert from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research visited Mareeba last year, and found that &#34; everything in the garden was lovely,&#34; amongst the tobacco planters. It appears that the inquiry promised by the Prime Minister has nothing to <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> with the subject of duty. The conditions of the growers at Mareeba last year were unaltered as regards costs of production, and they were more than satisfied with the price received for their leaf. I caused a telegram to be sent to the Prime Minister&#39;s secretary yesterday, and I have received the following reply :  - </para>

                        <para>Main points of Mareeba deputation were that high cost of producing superior quality leaf this district  was  unprofitable at present prices and that growers were in desperate position ; secondly, that Tariff Board in considering position had not been informed of special circumstances of Mareeba; thirdly, that BritishAustralian tobacco not purchasing Mareeba leaf. Prime Minister promised firstly, that immediate inquiry into production costs and economic circumstances of industry at Mareeba would be undertaken by Townsend in conjunction with Howell tobacco investigation officer Mareeba andR obi n son development branch; secondly, that if it were true that Tariff Board had not given proper opportunity for presentation of Mareeba case circumstances of this district would be referred to&#39; Tariff Board.

                            <para>- This officer reported last year that the Mareeba growers were quite satisfied with their position, But, unfortunately, this year, in consequence of the ravages of a certain pest, they are dissatisfied. It seems wise, therefore, that the cause of their dissatisfaction should be inquired into. But this does not mean that they will be given preferential treatment. The whole trouble at Mareeba is that whereas the leaf grown last year was up to standard, the leaf grown this year is not up to standard. As usually happens in such a case, Parliament has been approached for assistance. An inquiry will be made into the circumstances at Mareeba, but a general inquiry will not be made. Houorable senators know that the Tariff Board made an exhaustive inquiry into this industry in October, 1931, on a reference to it by the Minister for Trade and Customs in the Scullin Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> The whole of the reports in the possession of the Tobacco Investigation Committee, and also the services of its expert officers, were made available to the board on that occasion. In these circumstances, another general inquiry could not be justified at present. </para>

                        <para>. - If I did not know <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> so well, I should be surprised at the illogical attitude that he has adopted on this subject. He opposed the request of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> for an increase of duty, but now he is asking for a postponement of the further consideration of the item. However, it seems to me that a case has been made out to justify the postponement of the item. In consequence of the rapid growth of tobacco culture in Australia, great changes have occurred in the industry since the last investigation was made. As no loss will be incurred by the growers through the postponement of the item, but&#39; benefits may follow from a further investigation into the industry, I think we are justified in asking the Government to hold its hand, at least until the promise of the Prime Minister has been fulfilled. Although it has been said that the proposed inquiry is to be confined to Mareeba, it would appear from information furnished to honorable senators that the causes of the dissatisfaction at Mareeba exist also in other districts. This may lead the Government to extend the scope of the inquiry. I &#39;shall, therefore, vote for the postponement of the item. </para>

                        <para>. - The problem confronting the Mareeba tobacco-growers is not confined to Mareeba. I have just returned from a visit to the tobacco-growing districts of South Australia, and I know that the problem which the Mareeba growers are facing is also being faced by the South Australian growers. While I welcome the promise of the Prime Minister that an inquiry will be made into the conditions at Mareeba, I ask for an assurance that a similar inquiry will be made into the conditions in South Australia. There is a growing feeling, among the tobacco growers that the tobacco manufacturers, who are protected by these high duties,  are  not playing the game towards the growers. The South Australian growers have grave fears that they will not be able to sell their leaf this year. The biggest buyer of local tobacco leaf in that State has announced that it will not declare its policy until August. This means that the tobacco-growers will have to keep their leaf in the cured state until August. No complaint has been made respecting the quality of the South Australian leaf. Seeing that this Parliament has formulated a definite policy for the encouragement of tobacco-growing in Australia, and is providing substantial protection for the manufacturers, it expects the manufacturers to deal fairly with the growers. </para>

                            <para>- The price is not a factor in the South Australian situation at the moment. The Carreras company has said, &#34; We do not intend to buy any South Australian leaf this year.&#34; It has not given any reason for this statement. The quality of the South Australian leaf grown this year is equal to that produced last year, when it was sold without trouble. Another company has said, &#34; We cannot tell you whether we shall purchase leaf or not. We shall determine our buying policy in August, and act accordingly.&#34; The South Australian crop matures earlier than that of Queensland. Ours is a federation of States, and, as I and others have to pay approximately 3d. on each packet of cigarettes in order to protect the Australian tobacco industry, I am concerned about South Australia receiving a section of the trade which is available. </para>

                            <para>- No; but I am bringing under the notice of the Minister a specific complaint that has been made to me by one of the leading tobacco-growers of South Australia; it was also communicated to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Badman,</inline> who asked questions on the subject in this chamber. The matter is important from the point of view of South Australia, and it should be investigated, and those engaged in&#34; the production of tobacco guaranteed some degree of certainty as to the disposal of their crop. I propose to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy&#39;s</inline> amendment, and would welcome an investigation. Without the aid of a deputation, I should like the Minister to give an assurance similar to that which was obtained by the Mareeba growers. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has criticized a person whom he has described as the &#34; Cromwell of the Riverina.&#34; I have read of that modern dictator in <inline font-style="italic">Smith&#39;s Weekly,</inline> but I do not really know who he is. At the same time, I know <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy,</inline> of New South Wales, and, while I am not the custodian of that gentleman&#39;s conscience, I am amazed at its elasticity, for it permitted him to vote against the request that was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> for an increase of the duty on imported tobacco, and then prompted him to move the motion for the postponement of the item now before the committee. However, that is his baby, and he will have to nurse it, and explain the reason for voting against the proposed increase of the duty on imported leaf when he faces the tobacco farmers of New South Wales. I support the motion . for postponement, as I want to have a. general inquiry made into the industry, such as was promised by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> and I do not wish it confined to any one State. Tobacco is extensively cultivated in the Tumut and New England districts of New South Wales, while farmers&#39; in the Derwent Valley district, of Tasmania, have invested thousands of pounds in the industry, and there are many growers in the Ovens district, in Victoria, and in South Australia, and in Queensland. All should have an opportunity of stating their case. I shall do everything possible to bring about a postponement of the item until a general investigation has been made into the industry; that will not in any way interfere with the protection that is given to the tobacco-growers. </para>

                        <para>&#91;3.46&#93;.  -  No good purpose can be served by postponing the item to deal with the complaint raised by Senator Daly and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Badman,</inline> that no leaf has been purchased in South Australia this year,for it is not a matter which can be referred to the Tariff Board. When complaints were made last year regarding the purchase of leaf by the tobacco companies, an investigation was carried out by officials of the Customs Department. I understand that the matter referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Badman</inline> has been investigated, and that buying this year will begin a month later than it did last year, because of the lateness of the crop in various parts of the Commonwealth, the outbreak of disease among Victorian crops, and excessive rains in some Queensland districts. Before a tobacco company sends its representatives through the widespread tobacco districts on their buying expeditions, it must determine its buying programme, to do which it must have an estimate of the probable quantity available, and also know something of the quality of the leaf. When it has gained this knowledge, it sends out its representatives. There is , no sinister motive for the delay that is incurred this year, which is due merely to the fortuitous circumstances that I have mentioned. The company intends to send its buyers to South Australia as in the past, but that will probably be a month later than usual. I have asked the officials of the Customs Department to note the criticism that has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Badman,</inline> and have been assured that the matter will not be lost sight of. I again impress upon honorable senators that no good can result from the postponement of the item. </para>

                    <para class="block">It has always seemed strange to me that a heavier duty should be imposed on artificial silk textiles than on those of pure silk. Artificial silk materials can be turned out very attractively, and at a price that suits the pockets of those of limited means, while silk of good quality can be purchased only by those of greater means. Therefore, artificial silk materials are imported in very much larger volume from Great Britain than are silk materials. </para>

                            <para>- The manufacture of artificial silk textiles has become an important industry in Great Britain. To retain their trade with Australia and other countries, manufacturers in the Mother Country have been compelled to give their attention to the production of this class of textile, and they are now turning out fabrics that hold their own with the products of any other country. In 1930-31, our imports from Great Britain of artificial silk and materials containing artificial silk amounted in value to &#163;596,443, and our total imports to &#163;1,302,367 ; last year, they declined to &#163;436,365, with a total importation of &#163;1,132,505. Approximately about one half of our importation of artificial silk textile materials comas from Great Britain. In 1930-31, we imported silk materials to the value of &#163;1,685,121, and in 1931-32, of &#163;1,331,719. From Great Britain, our imports of this material amounted to only &#163;145,983 in 1930-31, and &#163;116,727 in 1931-32, as against importations from Japan in 1930-31 amounting to &#163;1,217,080, and in 1931-32 to &#163;1,048,344. Yet in our tariff, we continue to penalize British manufacturers engaged in the production of artificial silk textile material while retaining lower duties on Japanese silk fabrics which, piece by piece, are not so satisfactory to the people of small means as are the artificialsilk textiles produced in Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- But it is not used for the same purposes as woollen textile materials. &#34;We have to remember that a not inconsiderable portion of this continent is sub-tropical. People living in Queensland should have the opportunity to purchase materials suitable for that climate. Woollen piece goods are not in demand in the northern portions of Australia, but artificial silk certainly is. There is a great deal of misconception among honorable senators as to the nature and quality of artificial silk goods, such as are now being manufactured in Great Britain. I have before me a range of plain artificial silk textile materials, which the manager of one of the largest firms in Australia has assured me are equal to anything that he has ever handled. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it is.. Our imports of that material from Japan amounted in 1930-31 to &#163;39,543, and last year to &#163;131,413. From Great Britain in those years we purchased &#163;596,443 and &#163;436,365 worth respectively. Our imports from Japan of silk materials are about ten times as great as are our importations of similar materials from Great Britain, proving conclusively that artificial silk is in much greater favour with our people. If we retain the existing duties on artificial silk, we shall be doing a great injustice to British manufacturers. </para>

                            <para>- The artificial silk textiles now being manufactured in Great Britainwill stand any amount of laundering, and are in every respect a really useful fabric, totally different from the crude artificial silk materials formerly manufactured in Great Britain and elsewhere. If wecontinue these heavier duties on artificial silk textiles, as compared with silk piece goods, we shall be doing harm to British manufacturers, and be giving foreign manufacturers of silk materials a still greater advantage. </para>

                            <para>- At the moment I cannot tell; but the Ottawa  conference agreed to a margin of 20 per cent, in favour of British manufacturers. From the Australian point of view, artificial silk is one of the strongest competitors with woollen materials, whatever the honorable senator may say to the contrary. It is manufactured in a most attractive form, so as to catch the eye of the fair sex. In respect of neither utility nor value can artificial silk be compared with wool, and its use is detrimental to the woollen industry and &#39;the revenue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has pointed out that on piece goods of silk or containing silk, the duties are 10 per cent, and 30 per cent., as compared with rates of 20 per cent, and 40 per cent, on artificial silk. I would prefer that people should wear articles of silk or containing silk rather than articles of artificial silk. At one time, men&#39;s ties were made principally of silk and artificial silk; to-day, we can buy superior ties made of wool. For the reasons I have stated, I oppose the request. </para>

                        <para>.- No one who has been in the softgoods trade would suggest that artificial silk enters into competition with ordinary woollen textiles. Before artificial silks were produced, women had to rely largely on cotton-printed goods for light apparel, Cotton is comparatively harsh to the skin. The trade in ordinary calico and longcloth is not nearly so great as it was twenty years ago, and this is due mainly to the fact that British invention has produced softer materials which are more suitable. Artificial silk takes the place of silk and cotton materials, which are not manufactured in Australia. Woolhas its own uses, and we all appreciate its value for undergarments and heavy, warm piece goods; it certainly does not suffer from the competition of artificial silk goods, which are used principally for cool outer garments. I cannot ignore the Minister&#39;s statement that this duty on artificial silk is imposed purely for revenue purposes, and I therefore suggest that silk and artificial silk should be subject to the same rates of duty. If that were done, the British manufacturer would have that&#39; protection against foreign competitors to which he is entitled. </para>

                    <para class="block">For many years fuel required for stationary engines was admitted free of duty. Later, when the duties were raised, a line appeared in the schedule stating that fuel for stationary engines, tractors, and farm machinery would not be subject to the duty of 7d. per gallon. This tax was raised to its present level mainly for road purposes, and the Commonwealth Government hands actually 2&#189;d. of the 7d. to the State Governments for the construction and maintenance of main roads. With the revenue derived from the duties imposed on petrol wonderful highways have been constructed between the capital cities in the eastern States, and to this no one objects. But there is a strong feeling of dissatisfaction among those using petrol engines, auto-headers, and other similar machines, who have to pay this heavy duty, without using the roads. When a detour is made from the main highways, unsatisfactory roads are immediately encountered, and it is these that the farmers use, for the most part. </para>

                            <para>- It is being satisfactorily administered in New Zealand to-day. The customs officials are able to overcome the most intricate problems associated with machinery. For instance, they have determined that a tractor which hauls a machine should pay a higher duty than one which pushes a machine, and the Customs Department which, in the collection of revenue, is the most efficient in the world, should be able to submit an ingenious method of overcoming this difficulty. It should be able to administer this scheme, particularly as a similar arrangement is in operation in New Zealand. Farmers and others engaged in primary production should be able to get some advantages from power machinery which they have purchased, but, unless they use power kerosene as a fuel, which is very heavy, they are compelled to use petrol, which is costly for farm work. They have either to use power kerosene or to pay a heavy duty on petrol. That was comparatively easy during the period when the prices obtained for their commodities were high ; but, with the low prices now prevailing, they are facing ruin. This remission of duty should be granted, particularly as a similar concession was provided in the 1926 tariff, and remained on the statute-book until 1929. At that time it was provided that the petrol companies and the users should certify that the petrol was used for agricultural purposes. As the companies refused to grant a certificate, the law in that respect was inoperative, and the farmers did not obtain the relief which Parliament intended. Under the exemption which I have proposed, fuel used by aeroplanes would be obtainable at the lower rate. The Defence Department uses a large number of aeroplanes, and unnecessary additional expense should not be incurred for defence purposes. As certain aeroplane services in the outback parts of Australia are heavily subsidized, and the Government is about to call for tenders for an extension of these services, the cost of this form of transport should not be made higher than is necessary by charging a duty of 7d. a gallon on the petrol used. The amount of 5&#189;d. a gallon has been fixed to ensure that there shall he no inconsistency between the product of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited which is distilled in Australia, and that of other petrol suppliers. The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited pays 5-Jd. excise duty on its products. It has been suggested that the petrol subject to the lower rate of duty should be coloured, or that it should be sold in containers; but that is a matter which could be determined by the customs officers, who could obtain information from the New Zealand Government as to its method of making a distinction, where relief in this respect has already been granted. </para>

                        <para>. - It was the policy of the Government with which I was pre- viously associated to give effect to the principle embodied in the honorable senator&#39;s request; but it was found to be impracticable. We believed in the principle, but, in endeavouring to apply it, found that the difficulties of administration were insurmountable, due partly to constitutional limitations, and, ultimately, had to abandon it. An amendment similar to the request now before the committee was moved in another place, but&#39; even before that was done the subject was discussed by Cabinet. It was also under consideration when the Bruce-Page Government was in office, but attempts to afford relief failed. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson),</inline> who was a member of the Bruce-Page Government, and the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker),</inline> who were interested in the scheme, were invited to suggest a means of overcoming the difficulties, but they could not do so. In the dominion of New Zealand, that difficulty does not arise. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> will make inquiries, he will find that the administration in New Zealand is far from satisfactory. A similar scheme has been attempted in the United States of America, where, I understand, the device of colouring petrol was unsuccessfully tried. Although Ministers and officials in New Zealand have approached the subject in a most sympathetic way, numerous difficulties exist. An effort waa made by the Bruce-Page Government, and by the late Government, to afford some relief, but all attempts to do so failed. In 1926, the tariff proposals of the Government imposed duties of 2&#189;d. per gallon, British, and 3d. per gallon, general, on petroleum and shale spirits, such as petrol and benzine, irrespective of the purpose for which the spirit was used. In an attempt to relieve petrol consumers who did not use petrol in road vehicles from a tax imposed for road purposes, an amending tariff proposal was introduced shortly afterwards. The amendment provided that, subject to departmental bylaws, petroleum and shale spirits used otherwise than in motor-driven vehicles, cycles, tractors, road rollers, and similar appliances using public roads should be admissible at the rates of duty previously in force, namely, &#189;d. per gallon, British,  and Id. per gallon, general. For the purpose of protecting the revenue, the department found it necessary to require importers of petrol to lodge a cash deposit equal to the difference between the lower and the higher rates of duty, the deposit to be refunded upon submission of satisfactory evidence that the petrol had been used otherwise than, in motor-driven vehicles using public roads. The evidence demanded by the department took the form of a statutory declaration by both the importer and the user, indicating the particular purpose for which the petrol had been used. The difficulties experienced in attempts to administer the by-law were, however, so great as to be practically insurmountable. In the first place, the customs law does not enable refunds of duty to be made except to the .person who originally paid the duty. Petrol is not used by the importer, but passes through one or more intermediaries before reaching the user. Almost every country user of petrol for other than road purposes also uses petrol in a motor car or truck using public roads. With petrol users scattered in thousands throughout the Commonwealth, the oil companies were involved in considerable expense in attempts to provide machinery which would enable the refunds to be made. But they found it quite impossible to keep  office records which would enable the department to satisfy itself that the refunds were properly due. Numerous discussions took place between the executive officers of the department and the principal oil importers in an earnest&#39; endeavour to reach a practicable arrangement, but importers finding the position, impossible, adopted the practice of paying the full duty at the time of entry, and ceased to claim refunds except in respect of petrol consumed by certain large consumers such as rubber manufacturers, aviation companies, dyers and cleaners, whose transactions in petrol could be verified. A further complication has arisen since the by-law item was first incorporated in the tariff in 1926. Since August, 1929, an excise duty has been imposed on petrol distilled in Australia, so that the further difficulty arises, in the granting of the rebate, of distinguishing between Australian and imported spirit, which are invariably sold at the same prices. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>It has been suggested &#39;that the difficulty of granting rebates of duty could be overcome by the colouring or tinting of petrol intended for other than road purposes. An examination of this suggestion has been made, and it is apparent that there would be very serious difficulties in the way of administering such a scheme. In the first place, the importer would present his entry at the free rate of duty, or at the concessional rate, on the ground that the petrol was coloured or tinted. At this point, the Customs Department would have no means of checking, or even of knowing, the uses to which such petrol would be put. Presumably, this lack of evidence would necessitate the collection by the department of an amount equal to the ordinary duty which would be payable. But, even ignoring this aspect of the matter, if the petrol were admitted free, or at the concessional rate, the Customs Department would have no authority to check the uses to which it was to be put. Even if it did&#39; check such uses, and found that some of it was being put to illegitimate uses, it could not take action against the user, because the person who entered the petrol was the importer. The first essential step, to be taken, therefore, would be to induce the .States to pass legislation making it an offence to use coloured petrol for road purposes. The policing of the scheme would then have to be considered, and it is obvious that the best scheme would present many loopholes. Moreover, the system of checking and inspecting the petrol in motor car tanks would be an exceedingly dangerous one. We therefore come back to the point that, for the protection of the revenue, the Customs Department must be assured of the uses to which the petrol would be put, and that it must, therefore, demand the ordinary duty at the time of importation. That brings us back to the refund system which was persevered with by the department for&#39; a number of years, and under which no refund was granted in respect of any petrol used for farming purposes. Certain aviation companies, rubber companies and dry cleaners, and boot polish manufacturers, received remissions of duty, but the main purpose of the item was to grant petrol at concessional rates to primary producers when it was used for other than road purposes. </para>
                    <para class="block">Since the department was then unable to devise a scheme which would adequately protect the revenue, it is safe to say that with the intensification of the depression, it would be much more difficult to lay down plans which would effectively meet all the difficulties inherent in this proposal. </para>
                    <para>It is true that a scheme of rebates on petrol used for non-road purposes operates in New Zealand ; but it must be remembered that New&#39; Zealand has a unified form of government, with one Parliament, which has complete and full power, so that the system mentioned can be operated there with some hope of success. Such a scheme would be infinitely more costly to operate in the Commonwealth, owing to the lack of constitutional power in the Commonwealth Government. In New Zealand, the motor registration branch operates this system, whereas in Australia, motor registration is controlled by the States. When in New Zealand recently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> inquired into the working of this system, and found it most unsatisfactory. There was friction and trouble on all sides, and a large percentage of the claims made had to be rejected. The scheme does not appear to be working successfully in the sister dominion. Nor has it been successful in the American States which adopted it. If honorable senators can suggest a means whereby the primary producers may obtain a rebate, while not leaving the way open for unwarranted claims by others, the Government would give it the most sympathetic consideration. So far, however, it has not been able to find a way to overcome the danger associated with such a system, and it has, therefore, decided to allow things to remain as they are. </para>

                    <para>That the House of Representatives be requested to make the duty, sub-item (c2), paragraph (c2), per lineal foot, general, 4d. </para>
                    <para>The general tariff as set out in this item has caused much perturbation among those interested in the distribution and exhibition of picture films, and I, in common with other honorable senators from Tasmania, have received a considerable number of letters setting out the position as it appears to those interested in the motion picture industry. I have received a communication, dated the 17th June, from the Plaza Theatre, Launceston, one extract from which reads - </para>
                    <para>It is, perhaps, needless to point out that it is in the motion picture theatres that the great majority of the people find their theatrical entertainment. In fact, the cinema may justly be designated the poor man&#39;s entertainment. Like every other industry, the motion picture business in the last few years has been greatly affected by economic circumstances - probably to a greater degree than  other enterprises, and it has been only by the employment of emergency measures that the industry has been able to provide programmes without increasing prices. Even so, the considerable falling off in patronage has made it extremely difficult to carry on, and it is humanely impossible for the industry, already burdened as it is with taxation, exchange, &#38;c, to continue the policy of cheap entertainment with any hope of success. </para>
                    <para>At the present time the output of British films is not sufficient to supply the needs of Australia, particularly in the matter of first-class feature photo plays, andit is vital to the industry that supplies of American pictures should not be cut off, for a standard has to be maintained, which, of course, is necessary to our existence. There is still a tendency for patronage to shrink. Last year, for instance, according to the annual report of the Federal Taxation Commissioner tabled recently in Parliament, the amount of admission money to picture theatres and the resulting entertainment tax dropped by 4.6 per cent. Should this tariff item be ratified, it will assuredly mean that the extra cost will be handed on to the exhibitor by the exchanges; that is inevitable, and the exhibitor will have no other alternative but in turn to pass it on. </para>
                    <para>Beyond doubt, that would cut patronage still further. The increase in the duty of 200 per cent, will demand a considerable increase in admission prices, and that is going to effect adversely all concerned - the public, the exhibitor, and taxation revenue. </para>
                    <para>The following is an extract from a letter from Frank Reynolds and Cummins, auditors, Hobart: - </para>
                    <para>Any action therefore which will increase the cost of film, such as the proposed increase of duty to1s. per foot, must re-act against the continuation of the present services, and will mean eventually more unemployment, as all the theatres could not continue to operate. If the move is intended to oust the American film companies, the Government should say so, remembering that these companies employ large staffs in Australia, that laboratories for printing films will be closed, and further unemployment result in this direction. </para>
                    <para class="block">Greater Union Theatres, Brisbane-street, Launceston, write - </para>
                    <para>The proposal affects almost exclusively American product, and although I am essentially British, screening a large proportion of British and Australian pictures, and heartily endorse any steps taken to further the cause of the Empire product, I cannot but feel that should the proposed increase become law, it will drastically affect my business, even to the extent of closing my theatre. This last phrase, at first sight, may appear somewhat fantastic, but will simply state the case as it concerns Launceston. There are three theatres here needing about eight features per week. British and Australian product amounts to about 25 per cent, of pictures released in Australia, or approximately one hundred features. It is a matter of simple arithmetic to see that Launceston needs every available picture released to keep its three theatres going. What happens therefore if the supply of foreign film is cut down? Undoubtedly, at least one theatre will be closed, and it might be mine. </para>
                    <para class="block">Further on they say - </para>
                    <para>The proposed increase simply means this: - a distributing company releasing (for the sake of argument) 60 features a year with an average length of 7,000 feet, will be called upon to lay out an extra &#163;14,000 per annum. There is no company in existence in Australia to-day that can afford to carry this huge increase in overhead, which means that will be passed on to the exhibitors, who,in turn, must pass it on to the masses, by way of increased admission charges. </para>
                    <para class="block">A letter in similar terms has been sent by the Majestic Theatre, Brisbane-street, Launceston. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kemp,</inline> the  Chairman  of Directors of the Avalon Theatre, writes - </para>
                    <para>Further, the new increase in duty will in no way increase the importation of British pictures, as at the present time all British product is being imported into the country and being screened, and the amount of British product available is not sufficient to take care of the number of theatres requiring service. </para>
                    <para class="block">It would appear that there are in Australia between 1,250 and 1,300 picture theatres, but as a result of the prevailing depression many of those are probably not now exhibiting films. As a matter of fact, I am informed that about 50 of them have gone out of business recently. The high duty has surely reduced importations, and it must create a monopoly, because, obviously; the big theatre groups would make it difficult for the independent or the country exhibitor to procure programmes. Statistics have been prepared by Flack and Flack, chartered accountants, of Sydney. Some of the figures were supplied by the Department of Trade and Customs. They show that the footage of films imported, including those imported free from the United Kingdom within recent years, has been as follows: - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">The material drop in those figures cannot be wondered at; both the public and the corporations which own the different picture theatres have been seriously perturbed at the increase of the duty from 4d. to1s. a foot. That rise was in the nature of an invitation to showmen to import what is known as negative film, and to have it printed from in Australia. That action was taken, with the result that a considerable amount of employment was provided in this country on that work. </para>

                    <para class="block">The figures are for the companies connected with the Motion Picture Distributors Association of Australia, and when you realize that the drop in returns from the peak year, 1030, is over &#163;700,000, it will immediately be seen that the cream of the business has gone, and such a drop in total earnings, of necessity, has brought about a considerable reduction in taxation. It must be realized that when the duty was increased to 4d., it compelled the Member Companies to develop the films in this country. This brought into existence several laboratories which I understand are doing very well indeed, and in wages, direct and indirect taxation, pay in the vicinity of &#163;60,000 per year. So whilst some people may feel that the companies are saving the money in duty, they are in reality spending it in Australia. It is fair to reason that if it is the policy of the Government to compel the production in Australia, the revenue from the tariff cannot be maintained. This is the position of the film business. The returns to the distributor from the box office are 25 per cent. There are many extravagant statements made in regard to this, but after careful investigation, it can definitely be said that the film hire is approximately 25 per cent. Investigating a little further, this 25 per cent, has to carry, as far as the producer is concerned, the working expenses in Australia, income tax, duty and exchange, which is a very severe tax, and as near as it is possible for the auditors to work out these figures, out of the 25 per cent, taken from the box office, the producer actually netts 4.27 per cent. This means that the company or person who finds the entertainment obtains 9d. in the &#163;1 for doing so. </para>

The revenue for the same period ranged from &#163;134,310 to &#163;295,004, and averaged &#163;177,416 per an num.

                        <para>You quote the reduction in footage of film. This was brought about as a matter of public policy, and the Government cannot develop an industry within Australia and expect duty from without. Further, evidently there has been no consideration given to the increased taxation both in Federal and State, and we make bold to say, with increased income tax, primage, and State taxation taken into account, the total figures would reveal the fact that the industry is not paying less total taxation, including the duty which was paid in the years named by you. </para>

                    <para>This matter must be regarded, first, from the revenue point of view. If, having regard to the facts that I shall place before them, they consider that these films should not contribute to the revenue in the present proportion, it will be for them to indicate from what source the Government may obtain what it needs to conduct the affairs of this country. The protest against the increased duty relates to films that are imported for copying purposes. The exhibitors themselves are not acquainted with the position as between the importing firms and the Government. It is commonly said that the hire charges would have to be increased by 200 per cent., but I think that I can show that that statement is not. correct. &#34;While this duty  is imposed primarily for revenue purposes, it seems to me that it should be regarded also as a means for improving the tone of the pictures exhibited in this country. </para>
                    <para>In the five years prior to the imposition of the duty of 4d. per foot on foreign films, the average annual footage of foreign film upon which duty was paid amounted to 23,480,000 feet, and the revenue received therefrom averaged &#163;177,400 annually. Except for the period from the 22nd August, 1929, to the 30th June, 1930, when the duty was 3d. per foot, this revenue was derived from a duty of ltd. and 1¾d. per foot. &#34;When the duty was increased to 4d. per foot on the 10th July, 1930, during the last Government&#39;s period of office, the imports of foreign film upon which duty was paid dropped to 8,930,000 feet in 1930-31, and to 3,401,000 feet in 1931-32, and the revenue received from these duties decreased from an annual average of &#163;177,400 to &#163;148,000 in 1930-31*, and &#163;57,000 in 1931-32. For the last financial year, the loss in revenue amounted to &#163;120,000, as compared with the average collections in previous years. The drop in revenue amounts to 68 per cent. </para>
                    <para>The revenue received from, films during 1929-30 was &#163;295,000. This revenue was collected mainly with a rate of 3d. per foot. There were special circumstances accounting for the high revenue received in that year; I refer to the change over from silent to sound films, which necessitated the importation of films of both kinds. But even- assessed on the average annual revenue return of &#163;177,000, the increase of the duty from lid. to 4d. per foot imposed by the Scullin Government failed to yield the increased revenue which that Government anticipated would be collected. Instead of reaching a higher figure, the revenue, on account of the importation of a single copy of film pictures only, fell to &#163;14S,000 for 1930-31, and to &#163;57,000 for 1931-32. </para>
                    <para>The principal reason for the marked decline in the importations of foreign films, and in the revenue derived from them, is that importers, instead of importing the number of copies of the same film required for screening purposes, have adopted the practice of importing a single negative, or soft positive, and printing from it the number of positives required for screening purposes. The new practice has resulted in a heavy loss of revenue, without compensating benefits, as the total wages paid in the filmprinting industry, plus the revenues derived from duty on the raw film stock, and various other forms of State and Federal taxation paid by the printing industry, represent only 46 per cent, of the lost revenue. At the same time, the spreading of the duty over all the screening copies made from a, single imported negative largely nullified the preference of 4d. per foot accorded to British films. That preference was practically whittled away. In addition, it very materially reduced the protection which the. duties gave to Australian feature film producers. </para>

                            <para>- One object of the duty was to build up a healthy sentiment among our people by providing them with, pictures of educational value, and another purpose in view was to obtain necessary revenue, Whether the feature films which are now shown are educational value is a question I leave honorable senators to answer for themselves. In effect, the duty, instead of being 4d. per foot, became, on the eight copies usually printed from the negative, something like a halfpenny per foot. Under the recent tariff amendment, practically the only films subject to the increased duty of ls. per foot are feature films, imported from foreign countries for copying purposes. The duty of ls. per foot will still leave it more profitable to import the negative, and have the copies printed in Australia,- than to pay the duty on each copy required for screening purposes. Negative film imported for- exhibition purposes, as distinct from film imported for copying purposes, is still admissible at the same rate of duty as formerly. Topical and scenic subjects, travel-talks, and similar films, serials and &#34; shorts &#34; of 2,000 feet, which are recognized as having a limited earning capacity, have also been exempted from the increased duty. </para>

                    <para>Importers are in a position to.spread the incidence of the duty, which is payable only on the film imported for copying purposes, amongst all the exhibitors to whom the subsequent copies are hired. Consideration of the incidence of the duty will show that there is not the slightest necessity for any substantia&#93; increase in hire charges. The increase of 8d. per foot on the negative of a feature film of 6.000 feet amounts to &#163;200., In the past, from six to eight copies of the negative have been printed in Australia. When the increased duty is spread over these copies, it amounts to &#163;33 a copy, if six copies are printed, and to &#163;25 a copy if eight are printed. One copy is usually supplied to each State, with an additional copy for the larger States. Even if the increased cost is passed on, it should be infinitesimal when spread throughout the State, over all the exhibitors to whom the picture is hired. </para>
                    <para>Actually, the total duty which will be paid in the future by importers of films, assessed on importations for last year, should not exceed &#163;120,000. This figure is &#163;57,000 less than the average collections for the five years prior to the increase of the duty to 4d. per foot. There is, therefore, no reason why the charges to exhibitors on account of duty should, in the aggregate, exceed the charges in the years prior to the change in the practices of importers. , From a detailed examination of the trading results of the film printing companies, it is quite evident that a contraction of the high profits in this section of the film business could absorb a substantial proportion of the slightly increased costs due to the recent alteration of the duties. Indeed, the aggregate net profits earned by the film printing companies during their last complete financial period represented 46&#163; per cent, of the whole of the capital actually invested in the film printing industry, while for every &#163;3 paid out in wages to employees, the industry declared net profits of &#163;2. The Government has given full and careful consideration to the representations made to it by the various interests concerned, and it cannot accept the requested amendment which has been submitted. </para>
                    <para>The increased duty on films was imposed at the beginning of March last. Despite, immediate threats on the part of distributors of foreign films in Australia that they would have to pass the increased duty on to the  exhibitors,  no specific case has been brought under notice showing that any increase has been made in hire charges to exhibitors by reason of the increase of the duty. From the figures which I gave earlier, it must be evident to honorable senators that the increased cost of each copy exhibited will range from &#163;25 to &#163;33 only, and this cost would, if passed on, need to be spread over the whole of the exhibitors in the State in which such copy was to be exhibited. I ask honorable senators to attempt to assess the increased cost to each exhibitor on this basis. At the most, it would only mean a matter of pence in the total cost of each programme. The result of inquiries, moreover, shows that the film printers could divert some of their high profits towards reduced charges for printing. If this were done, then the costs to distributors should be considerably less than those quoted. </para>
                    <para>Finally, let me say that if remissions of taxation are to be made in aid of those primary industries which are so sorely in need of some measure of assistance, it is essential that we should exercise our mature judgment in matters involving remissions in other directions. Above all, we should be careful not to yield to the pressure of a campaign organized by foreign interests, who have not put the position frankly to honorable senators. A certain variation has been given to the terms of the communications which have been addressed to honorable senators; but the same spirit is displayed throughout the whole of them, and it is shown in some of the statements from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has read extracts this afternoon. Even Ministers have not been immune from the fire of correspondence. Despite this propaganda, I ask honorable senators to remember that, apart from the fiscal and revenue aspects of this matter, we should try to encourage British and Australian films. </para>

Any increase of taxation is, to such persons, like a mountain, and it is not surprising that they are fearful of the result of this increase of duty.

                    <para class="block">The writer of that statement has taken a sane view of what is likely to happen. The Scullin Government, which was in much greater need of revenue than is this Government, endeavoured to increase the amount received from the taxation of picture films by increasing the duty of 4d. per lineal foot. It expected to obtain an aggregate amount of 2s. per foot from this duty, because up to that time the importers were importing six copies of each film. But when the new duties became operative, the picture producers tricked the Government, and actually reduced its revenue by importing only one copy of each film. The duty which the Government is now seeking to impose will undoubtedly make a bigger call upon the exhibitors of pictures, and they will endeavour to pass the impost on to the patrons of picture shows. The result may be that the price of admission to picture shows will become so high that the poorer people will not be able to pay it. This would cause a fall in revenue from several sources, including the entertainment tax. It is astonishing how much the picture show business has fallen away in the  last few years. In 1929, which was the year in which the Scullin Government imposed the tax of 4d. per foot, film importations totalled 31,000,000 feet annually, but in 1931, the importations had fallen to 16,000,000 feet &#39; annually. The duty collected in 1929 was &#163;148,000. The Scullin Government sought to increase this by increasing the tax from 1¾d. to 4d. per foot, but the result was that the aggregate amount of duty received fell to &#163;58,000, or only a little more than one-third of the amount collected under the lower rate of duty. The admissions to picture shows have also fallen off. This, of course, is a reflection of the financial position of the people.  In 1930, just after the depression struck Australia, nearly 7,000,000 paid admission annually to the picture theatres of Australia, but in 1932, the number had fallen to a little more than 2,000,000. The amount received in amusement tax fell from &#163;9S,000 in 1930, to &#163;28,000 in 1932. The people plainly have not now the money that they had formerly to spend on picture shows. I am afraid that if any increase of duty is made at this stage, there will be a further falling away in the attendances. </para>
                    <para>I realize that revenue must be obtained by the Government, but think it should be obtained from some other section of the community. The picture show is always looked upon as the amusement of the poor people, and it is desirable that the price of admission to picture shows should be kept as low as possible. An increase of duty will undoubtedly mean an increase in the price of admission. For this reason, I feel that the Government should explore some other field of taxation. I suggest that instead of increasing the duty on picture films, the Government should seek to build up the film-producing industry of Australia. I have been informed from a reliable source that in consequence of the flood of American picture films into England, and the consequent reluctance of the British people to invest their money in film production, the Government of the United Kingdom adopted the quota system, and required that 30 per cent, of the films exhibited at every theatre in the United Kingdom should be of British origin. The result has been that the British&#39; people have been induced to invest their money in film production. There is now more than &#163;30,000,000 invested in the film-producing industry of Great Britain, and I am informed that very shortly the British films will practically oust the Hollywood productions from British, theatres. </para>

                        <para>. - I am concerned for the welfare of the majority of the people who attend picture shows. I should &#39; like to see the moving picture industry socialized. The provision of this form of amusement should be made a public service like the post office and the supplying of water, light and power, and there seem to me to be substantial reasons why it should be socialized. It has been stated by one honorable senator that under present conditions, the great majority of . the men and women of Australia find it difficult to provide the money to pay for their admission to picture theatres. Personally, I shall not lose any sleep should certain people be inconvenienced by the fixing of this duty at 4d. per lineal foot. The Minister in charge of the bill told us that the proposed reduction of the duty would result in a loss of revenue amounting to &#163;140,000. The honorable senator has asked how that could be made up, and I shall assist him with a few suggestions. Australia owes bondholders in the United States of America approximately &#163;47,000,000, on which it pays interest to the tune of &#163;4,000,000 per annum, which works out at 6 per cent, sterling, or, on a goods exchange basis at present values, 9 per cent. If the Government insisted on paying only 3 per cent, to those bondholders, that would save &#163;2,000,000 a year. Here is another suggestion. We learn from the press that the Government has accumulated a surplus of &#163;3,000,000- </para>

                            <para>- As an economic philosopher, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> must agree that that is due to our present system. The splendid pictures that are made at Elstree, in England ; by the U.E.A. Company, in Germany; an Italian company, at Milan ; in Soviet Russia, and by Pathe Freres, in Prance, demonstrate that Hollywood is not the only pebble on the beach. If I had my way, I would see .that Australian actors and producers were given a better opportunity to compete with the world. Have we developed an inferiority complex that we are afraid to give the Australian picture industry reasonable opportunity to establish itself? We have a country admirably suited to any class of picture production, and all that is necessary to the success of local production is a little encouragement. If the Government rejects my suggestions, and, in consequence, gets a headache, I can still assist it by suggesting as a cure that it go across Prince&#39;s bridge, Melbourne, to the aspro factory. </para>

                        PEARCE.They were said to be right on a former occasion. As the tactics they adopted during their &#34; Save our Amusements &#34; campaign brought about the defeat at the elections of a number of men who were formerly members of this chamber, I wonder at the shortness of the memory of those honorable senators who are now coming to the rescue of the American picture-producing industry in regard to that result of the intervention of these foreign interests in the politics of this country. Let us examine the facts. During the last few months these foreign picture interests have saved themselves the payment of approximately &#163;100,000 of taxation through the customs. But that saving has not been passed on to the Australian exhibitors. Owing to the way in which their contracts are drawn, the film producers are able to pass on to the exhibitors all additional taxation, but have not given them one penny of relief in respect of the saving to which I have just referred. These foreign companies are able to make such contracts because they hold the Australian exhibitors absolutely in their power. The latter are merely creatures in the hands of these foreign companies, which extract from them the uttermost farthing. Under their awful contracts these foreign companies &#34; graciously &#34; permit Australian exhibitors to screen American film trash, and those awful sex pictures  that .are demoralizing so many, of our younger people, on condition that they hand over to the producers 50 per cent., not of the profits, but of the gross takings! When this Parliament, in its desire to ensure the screening of cleaner British pictures, imposed a higher rate of duty on foreign films, these foreign interests, for a little while, were obliged to pay the higher duty. But with that ingenuity which distinguishes so many of their commercial undertakings, those controlling the American picture industry soon found means to circumvent the tariff. What did they do? They discovered that, by importing only the master picture and printing copies of it in Australia, they were able to defeat the intention of this Parliament. In this way they evaded payment of the higher duty except in respect of the master film, and thus saved &#163;100,000, which previously had gone into the Consolidated Revenue.

                        PEARCE.But the Government determined to make another attempt to compel these foreign picture interests to refund to this country some of the enormous profits which they have been taking out of it for so many years. It imposed a duty of ls. a foot on foreign films. Then what happened? Were direct representations made by the foreign picture interests against this new duty ? Oh, no ! Again they brought pressure to bear upon the exhibitors - those people who were compelled to do all the squealing on the previous occasion - they were the monkeys who had to pull the chestnuts out of the fire. Again they applied the thumbscrew. Under the contract which these foreign companies have made with the Australian exhibitors, they are able to apply the thumbscrew with telling effect upon exhibitors. The telegrams and letters with which honorable senators have been inun dated are ample evidence of the forces at work in this matter.

                            <para>- I am astounded that any member of this Senate should have been induced tq move a request for an amendment of the duty, and that any other honorable senator should give hig support to a proposal, the. effect of which, if accepted by the. House of Representatives, would be to enrich the foreign picture interests more heavily. Not one penny of the relief which the foreign interests would get by the lowering of the duty would be passed on to the exhibitors. Moreover, if this request were agreed to, these foreign interests will not import a greater number of films, as one might imagine, but will continue the practice of importing only the master picture, and printing copies of it in Australia. The saving of customs duties thus made possible will not benefit Australian exhibitors to the extent of one penny. All this sympathy that is being poured out by honorable senators, and the tactics to which they are lending themselves, from mistaken motives I admit, are really so many covert moves linder the direction of the American picture interests. They are the people who will reap all the benefit from a successful attack on this higher duty. Not one penny of it will go to Australian exhibitors. Even a returned soldier organization, which is exhibiting pictures for the purpose of getting revenue to pay off the debt on its memorial hall, has been induced to join in the appeal. I ask honorable senators to consider the conditions that make it possible for these foreign picture interests so to tie up a body of men that they allow their voice to be. used in this attempt to further the interests of the foreign picture producers against British picture producers. These foreign interests will not pass on to. that returned soldiers&#39; organization any benefit that they may gain from a reduction of the duty. </para>

                        <para>. - I greatly enjoyed the speech of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> as a display of dialectics, but I cannot say that the effort was entirely without its weak points. I do not deny that there is in this material with which we have been supplied something which smacks of organized propaganda, and I mistrust organized propaganda as much as does any member of this Senate. I believe that, in some respects, we are an over-organized people, and that organizations move sometimes without the support of their own members. But, in spite of that, we have to face the simple fact that here is a proposal to increase the duty on films by 200 per cent. Therefore, when it is clear that a storm has been provoked by that step on the part of the Government, it is not necessary, I suggest, to look around for explanations why it has happened; the very act of the Government was calculated to arouse this storm, even had the organization not been so active as the Leader of the Government has said. </para>

                    <para class="block">Senate. I do not like to criticize a man of the standing and experience of the Leader of the Senate, hut I do think that his reference to foreign influences would have come better from the chartered libertines of debate - I shall not define them more specifically - who sit in another part of the chamber. Let us look at the facts of the case, and see whether, apart from the association of this powerful organization with the agitation, there is any substance in the case it puts forward. We must ask ourselves whether this new duty will be borne by those against whom it is directed, or whether it will be passed on. There seems to be an easy answer to that question, for this reason: Admittedly, in the contracts that are current, there is provision for passing on an impost should one be levied, and, by the postulate of the Leader of the Senate, this organization is of such a kind that, whatever it can pass on, it will. It is neither illegal nor immoral to pass on a tax imposed on you so long as you do it by lawful means. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Any tax imposed on a class may be avoided if the necessary action is taken in accordance with the law. If a heavy impost is laid on land, it may be evaded by subdividing the land, and thus distributing the burden. Therefore, the film organization is at liberty to pass on any tax if it may legally do so. These contracts have usually a currency for one year. We may take it, therefore, that the tax will be passed on, having regard, particularly, to the character given by the Leader of the Senate to this combine. Suppose the tax is passed on, what then ? According to the current contracts, it will be passed on to the exhibitors, who, in turn, must either bear the impost or pass it on. Are they likely to be in a position to pay the tax themselves? Is this a time when any industry is being carried on with such a margin of profit that it can afford to bear an additional impost of &#163;60,000, which, it is said, this tax is expected to yield ? If the exhibitors do not bear the impost, they must pass it oh, and to whom?They must pass: it on to a section of the community, which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> pointed out, is least able to bear it. I, too, have received letters in the same terms as those referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. It is clear that many persons conducting picture shows are working on very narrow margins of profit. Sometimes their object is to build memorial halls, and sometimes, perhaps, to found mechanics institutes. What happens if the tax is finally passed on to the public? In order to find out, it is only necessary to observe what has actually happened as the result of the heavy impost already placed on the industry. I admit that, for the figures I propose to cite, I am indebted to the Cinematograph Exhibitors Association, through its secretary in Melbourne. One paragraph of the memorandum I have received is as follows: - </para>

                    <para class="block">Do not these striking figures indicate that, if taxation is further increased, and passed on to the public who patronize picture shows, the effect must be to reduce attendances? The Government must then lose revenue, as- less will be paid in entertainments tax. In so far as this is an effort on the part of the Government to encourage the British film industry, I am entirely with it. In this regard, however,one must depend for information on outside sources, because there are few of us who are experts on all subjects that come before the Senate in the course of a tariff debate. The position, I understand, is that the British producers are able to supply only one-third of the pictures required by exhibitors, and the rest must be imported from American sources. If there are any defects in the American pictures, that is not a matter to be dealt with in the tariff schedule, but is one rather for the censorship. A depression has been defined as a time in which we learn to do without those things that our fathers never <inline font-style="italic">had&#39;.</inline> It may be that our fathers never had picture theatres, but we must admit that  the picture theatres provide a cheap and, on the whole, an edifying form of entertainment. They supply recreation for a class of people who cannot afford to pay high prices. It seems to me that this impost will hit those who are least able to bear it. For these reasons, therefore, reluctant as I am to oppose the Government which is charged with the responsibility of piloting this schedule through Parliament, I must support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> request. </para>
                    <para>SenatorRAE  (New South Wales) &#91;8.12&#93;.  -  I do not propose to repeat the profound arguments of other honorable senators, because I know that there is nothing more tedious than to repeat in poorer language what others have said more eloquently. I do think, however, that the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> was somewhat inclined to get on the high horse when discussing foreign influences. We are all of us heartily sick of the way in which we have been treated by the foreign influences referred to, namely, by the business section of the American people. I am not one of those who entertain prejudices against any race or nation as such; but, undoubtedly, Australia has nothing to thank American legislators for in the way they have treated this country. It would be most admirable, from that point of view, to be able to dispense altogether with the services of the American film producers. The fact remains, however, that what the Leader of the Government in the Senate had to say against foreign influences did not touch the essentials of the position as referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan.</inline> The fact that these interests successfully evaded a great portion of the taxation formerly directed against them, and will attempt to do the same again, is not remedied by abusing them. The denunciation of the American film producers, or of the organization which represents them in this country, can do nothing to relieve the situation. </para>

                    <para>SenatorRAE. - The progress during the last twelve months cannot be due to a duty only recently imposed. Behind the organized propaganda which has deluged honorable senators with letters and telegrams during the last few days, there is a legal agreement by which the distributors can pass on to the exhibitors any additional tariff imposts. The enforcement of these legal rights, while we are waiting for the development of a filmmaking industry in Australia, will inflict hardship on the exhibitors and their patrons, and the latter will be a diminishing number because of their inability to pay the higher charges. The Government has attempted to defend the increase of duties on two grounds. The first is the iniquity of the American organization in evading former taxation by passing it on to other sections of the trade. The second is that the Government does not know where it will make good the revenue that will be lost if this duty be reduced. For months past we have been told that the Government proposes to reduce considerably the taxation on one of the most prosperous sections of the community. The large land-holders are to be further relieved. </para>

                        <para>- The Government having asked how it will obtain the revenue which will be lost through the reduction of this duty, I am surely entitled to show where money can be saved or additional revenue raised. Some of the pastoralists  who are supposed to be &#34; on the rocks &#34; have been able to spend during the last few days &#163;23,000 on new rams for their flocks. The Government occupies an anomalous position; it has so much money that it is planning to relieve the wealthier sections of taxation, and yet it is imposing additional taxation which will further penalize the poorer sections, or compel them to abstain from a popular form of amusement. The picture shows are so universally popular that we should consider seriously before doing v anything that will reduce the number of people who can enjoy this form of amusement, and cause ruin to many exhibitors. One method of promoting the development of the film-making industry in Australia would be the application of a quota, and the subsidizing of a powerful company which should be able more rapidly to increase the number of locallymade films available for exhibition. Action on those lines would be a more straight-forward and a speedier method of developing the Australian industry than the indirect method which the Government has adopted. As for the revenue considerations, we are told that economic and financial conditions are improving, that one government has saved a particular State, and that other governments are preparing to save other States. With the boasted genius of the Commonwealth Government for restoring prosperity at short notice, there should be no difficulty in raising sufficient funds to supply the needs of the nation. I wonder why the present Commonwealth Government always chooses the most cowardly method conceivable of raising revenues. Why does it always attack the poorer sections - the invalid and old-age pensioners, the soldiers, and the civil servants - in order to obtain further revenue or to effect economies? </para>

                            <para>- The brunt of this attack, allegedly on a foreign combine; will be borne by innocent parties. If; because of their rights under a legal agreement, the American film distributors were able to pass on the duty of 4d., what is to prevent them from similarly passing on the tax of ls.? The lofty statesmanship by which Australia is to be freed from foreign domination, is revealed in the imposition of a tax which we all know the American combine will be able to pass on immediately to the exhibitors. This ferocious onslaught on the American octopus is ludicrous. It is a pity that the Government cannot pass on to the various States and other countries some of its surplus genius so that by the wider application of its beneficence, restoration may be substituted for depression throughout the world. </para>

                        <para>.- When speaking on the second reading of the Customs Tariff, I dealt with some aspects of the duties on films. Undoubtedly all is not well with the picture film industry, and not long ago I advocated the appointment of a commission to inquire into all its ramifications. The Leader of the Senate stated that the distributors are exercising their power under a legal agreement to pass the whole of the increased duty on to the exhibitors, and so compel them to appeal to honorable senators for relief. I admit that the distributing houses have a tremendous grip on the picture exhibition industry. A letter sent to me by the Motion Picture Exhibitors Association of Queensland states that not only do the distributors compel the exhibitors to pay any extra charges resulting from tariff variations, but, in some instances, they actually refuse to allow the showmen to reduce the prices of admission to the public below ls., although it has been represented that lower prices of admission would lead to increased attendances. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> stated, by interjection, that the increased duties on films has been operating since March last, and that the storm which has now burst has been brewing ever since. It is obvious that in the first three months of the operation of the increased duties, the distributors did not exercise their right to pass it on ; they bore the additional burden, probably expecting relief from this </para>

                    <para class="block">Parliament. By letters and telegrams I have received representations on this matter from practically every part of Queensland; and I find that the complaints of showmen are against the distributors of British and Australian films as much as against the distributors of American films.No more consideration is shown to the exhibitors by British than by American companies or agents. Therefore the contention that the increase of the duty from 4d. to1s. will encourage the distribution of British films, or the manufacture of Australian films, fails. About 95 per cent, of the films now produced in the United Kingdom are distributed in Australia, and yet they represent only a fraction of the films required for exhibition in this country. The film producers of Great Britain cannot meet the requirementsof Australian showmen. </para>

                    <para>SenatorFOLL. - Australians are not particularly keen on obtaining films or other things from America; they go to see pictures produced by American companies because such pictures provide them with the kind of entertainment they like.

In my second-reading speech, I gave an instance of the way in which one British firm of producers - Gaumont Gainsborough Studios - treated an Australian distributing company. At the expiry of the period covered by the original contract, it took from the Australian distributing company the sole right of distributing its pictures in Australia, and gave it to the Fox Film Corporation, an American concern, which had invested large sums in the British company. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. These duties are being passed on to those who are least able to bear them. I hold no brief for the distributors of American films; but I realize that they are not in a position to carry this additional burden. When a government, without any investigation or inquiry whatever, increases the duty on an article by 200 per cent., it must expect a reaction similar to that which has occurred in this case. It is useless for the Government to say that it did not realize that the revenue from the duty on films would fall. It ought to have known that, instead of importing several copies of a film, distributors were having films copied in Australia. I visited one of these film laboratories last Monday, in company with a number of other honorable senators, and together we discussed the matter fully with the company concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dan.</inline> Carroll, representing the picture show proprietors, was present, as was also <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wicks,</inline> the head of the laboratory. We were shown a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> when Prime Minister, in which the right honorable gentleman admitted that laboratories were being erected in Australia in order to copy films. When a protective duty causes a local industry to spring up, a reduction of the amount paid in import duties on the articles involved becomes inevitable, sooner or later. Our customs returns are less to-day than they were in boom times, simply because things which were then imported in large quantities are now being made in this coun-try.  That applies also to negatives. Copies are made here instead of being imported from the country of origin. Having visited the laboratory referred to in order to ascertain the position for myself, I wrote to the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> on the 21st June in the following terms: - </para>

                        <para>In company with a number of senators yesterday, I visited the Wicks Film Laboratories to see the work of copying films from negatives  imported  into Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dan</inline> Carroll, representing the picture-show proprietors, was also present, and we had a heart-to-heart talk with this gentleman. </para>
                        <para>I am satisfied that the increase of film duty to ls. per foot is too heavy a burden to place on the industry at the present time, and we Queenslanders are being- approached from every centre in our State urging some relief be granted. I have gone very fully into this matter, and am of opinion that the increase from 4d. to ls. is not only too heavy, but, furthermore, is inequitable. I recognize the necessity of protecting the revenue; but to charge all negatives ls. per foot regardless of the number of copies to be taken and the earning capacity of a film, is not a sound basis of taxation. </para>
                        <para>I would respectfully suggest to the Government that the duty be fixed at 4d. per foot with an excise of <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> or fd. per foot on each foot of copied film. Then where twelve copies are token, the total tax will be at <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> excise, lOd. per foot, or, at }d. excise, ls. Id. per foot- -and if a film is only worth copying six. times, at <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> excise, 7&#60;L per foot, will be the tax, and at fd. excise, 8|d. per foot. If the duty stays at ls., the pictures imported will drop away very considerably, and will throw the Australian showmen into the arms of the very rich American producers, who alone will be able to pay the big cost of bringing their product to Australia. There is a number of distributing houses which cannot operate at all now. </para>

                    <para class="block">If the Government is not prepared to agree to a reduction of this duty to 4d. a foot, and if it thinks that the copying of films in Australia will seriously affect the revenue, it should meet the position by charging an excise duty of, say, &#163;d. a foot on film copies made in Australia, rather than make all imported films, irrespective of their earning capacity, bear a duty of ls. a foot. Some films are not worth copying twelve times; they have not the same earning capacity as other films, and, therefore, they should not be taxed the same. If the duty were reduced to 4d. a foot, and a small excise duty - say, &#163;d. a foot - imposed on each copy, the tax would have some relation to the earning capacity of the film. An excise duty operates in relation to the products of our distilleries, wineries, and tobacco factories, and all that would be necessary in the case of films would he to have an officer present to see that no evasion of duties was attempted. </para>

                        <para>. - Many interests are affected by the duty on films. The distributors, the duplicators, the exhibitors, the general public, and t.he unionists engaged in the industry are all concerned with it. From what I can gather, the exhibitors are in favour of a reduction of the duty, as are also the distributors and the duplicators, while the local producers of pictures appear to be indifferent. A duty on films was originally imposed with the object of assisting the local production of films. We on this side believe in Australian production, and we would like to see the Australian picture industry develop so that there would be no need to bring in any American pictures, many of which are not worth looking at. I have visited many picture theatres, and have seen pictures Which have disgusted me. Were the people connected with the exhibition of pictures to devote themselves to educating the people, they would achieve something worth while; but, unfortunately, their only aim is to make money. A picture combine has no sentiment whatever. Throughout Australia there is a difference of opinion regarding the relative merits of American pictures and those from other countries. Naturally, each section uses the argument most suited to its own cause. We cannot blame it for doing that. The combine is out to gain as much as it can from the public, and at present is squealing and using the exhibitors in order to obtain a reduction of duty. It is obvious that it will use the duty of1s. a foot on films to bring pressure to bear upon the exhibitors, and the question from our point of view is what must be our attitude in order to safeguard the interests of hundreds of exhibitors throughout Australia. There is ample room for inquiry into this matter. In the meantime, if the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is agreed to, the item will be later discussed in the House of Representatives, and perhaps additional details will be revealed. I was surprised and interested when listening to the speech of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> It was certainly refreshing to hear his attack upon the combine, particularly in view of the fact that the party to which he belongs works in the interests of modern capitalism, which, after all, must inevitably develop towards combines. Yet we had the spectacle of the Leader of the Government in this chamber, the representative of capitalism, making an attack upon a combine. </para>

I hold with the policy of the Labour party that there should be a development towards the best form of organization in every industry in order to hasten the time when we, as a people, shall be able to utilize that organization in the interests of the people as a whole; in the case of the picture industry, not for the purpose of making profits for the United States of America, but in order to educate, interest, and amuse our people for their own betterment. We on this side see in the development of the picture industry in Australia a step in the direction of our objective, which is to control industry in the interests of the people. Meanwhile, I deplore the fact that this combine has been able, by its economic organization, to bleed the people and to exploit the smaller men connected with the industry. </para>

Great Britain imposes a duty of 5d. a foot on Australian films, but British films enter Australia free of duty. If it is the desire of the Government to obtain additional revenue, why does it not impose a duty upon all films from Great Britain in excess of one positive? In that way, we should assist, not only the duplicators in Australia, but also from 100 to 200 employees in the local industry. </para>

                    <para>There is another aspect to this matter. It has been admitted, coolly and calmly, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> that there may be  Something  in the agitation which  has  arisen within the last few days, and that the picture companies are suffering certain disabilities. We know that any additional taxation imposed upon the companies will probably be passed on to the public ; and if the public have to pay greater admission fees fewer people will attend the picture shows, which, of course, will reduce the amount of revenue collected from the amusement tax. Several States in Australia are suffering certain disabilities, and this Government has had to assist them. I understand that last year South Australia&#39; collected &#163;89,000 by means of the amusement tax, and, if, as a result of any action on our part,  the.  number of people who attend picture shows decreases, the revenue of that State will be reduced, and it&#39;s disabilities become greater. I urge the Government to agree to the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in order that the House of Representatives may have a further opportunity to discuss the item. We are all whole-heartedly in favour of the development of the Australian picture industry. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to support the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and am rather surprised at the attitude of the Government. I have been a member of this chamber for four and a half years, and during thatperiod only on two occasions have I seen the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> in a state of hysteria. When I was in control of a Supply Bill two years ago, I heard the right honorable senator deliver a speech on all fours with that  delivered  by him this afternoon. Hysteria is something which has baffled the best of physicians, and it would be presumptuous on my part to attempt to diagnose the cause, but on the previous occasion the right honorable senator did divulge the secret. </para>

                            <para>- I am trying to ascertain what is behind the Government&#39;s attitude. There are two hypotheses upon which its action can be explained. One which I propose to deal with in. a few minutes was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> and the other by our esteemed and hysterical friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> On the previous occasion to which I have referred the Leader of the Senate painted a picture - and honorable senators will remember it - of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> flirting with Mary Pickford on a hoarding in Sydney, and he complained bitterly about the conduct of Douglas Fairbanks. It was then disclosed that his real complaint was that he imagined that the motion picture interests, by some mysterious influence, had brought about the downfall  of  the Bruce-Page Government and the election to office of the Scullin Government. This afternoon his speech rather suggested that he would apply his prohibition principles even to the exhibition of pictures. I am not prepared to join him. Like every prohibitionist, he does not understand the use, and he pays too much attention to the abuse. I hope that the reason which he advanced for the retention of the Government&#39;s proposal will not be adopted as a principle  by  this national parliament. </para>

                    <para>I  come  now to the hypothesis upon  which  the Minister in charge of the tariff <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> explained the Government&#39;s action. As he visits picture theatres more frequently than does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> he is probably able to distinguish between good and bad pictures.  His  explanation was that this is a revenue item. I point out, however, that if the existing duty led to the organization of film importers, that organization would still continue under the new proposal, and a fewer number of films would beimported. Every one knows that the exhibitor is having a very lean time. A limited sum is available for amusement purposes, and the picture theatre proprietors receive only a proportion of it. If the exhibitor has to pay this additional duty, and in turn is compelled to raise his prices, one may expect a falling off in the number of his patrons, and eventually, the closing of a number of theatres and the cutting out of imported films. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> went further, and said that the Scullin Government&#39;s action was really in the nature of a gratuitous act in return for some great favour, and that, as a result, some honorable senators were defeated at the polls. </para>

                            <para>- Of course they did not. It is but an example of the hysteria of the right honorable gentleman; he did not know what he was saying. It is idle to suggest now that, in order to avoid the destruction that awaits those who do not prohibit American films, we should support the duty of1s. I cannot see how this will assist the Government to increase its revenue. But, assuming that it will do so, why tax further those who at present are bearing more than an equitable share of the burden? Does not the person who indulges in any form of self-gratification, whether it be by means of tobacco, liquor, or a picture show, pay double the tax paid by those who do not? The smoker of cigarettes contributes 3d. to the revenue whenever he purchases a packet. The Government admits that it will have a surplus of approximately &#163;3,000,000 this year. </para>

Any one who is acquainted with the back parts of Australia knows what a godsend picture shows are to&#39; them. I have personal knowledge of districts in the Never Never which, prior to the advent of the picture show, had no. other form of entertainment than local concerts. The population of these districts is limited and scattered, and the exhibitors barely  exist, although their admission charges are fairly high. The distributors take at least 50 per cent, of the gross receipts, leaving the whole of the expenses to be met out of the balance. If a portion of this additional duty is passed on to those exhibitors- </para>

This higher duty will not achieve that object, because it will be passed on. The Government may obtain additional revenue in one direction, but it will lose revenue in another. It must also be borne in mind that the American companies control the majority of the picture-show houses in Australia, especially in the cities, and are thus able to compel exhibitors to make up the principal part of their programme with their 1 productions, British films being used merely to fill up. That is a matter which the Government might well take in hand. Another possible result is the screening of inferior productions by the smaller shows. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps they could not; but the majority of the first-rate productions are reserved for the cities, which also have first use of the inferior class before they are sent to the country. If British picture production were assisted by the higher duty, one might be tempted to support it. One of the causes  of  our present trouble, however, is that the number of British pictures produced is not sufficient to meet Australia&#39;s requirements. The majority of the showmen that I know personally are as anxious as any honorable senator to screen British films, but these cannot be procured. The Leader of the Government in the Senate made rather a strong speech against the importers, but did not go right to the bottom of the matter. He denounced them as the instigators of this propaganda. Very likely they are; but the fact remains that they will pass this extra impost on to the showmen. </para>

To-day, it is true, with the advent of &#34; talkies &#34; their income is not so great as it was then, but nearly all the &#34; talkie &#34; apparatus belongs to a certain American company, and almost every picture showman is still indebted to that company for instalments of purchase&#39; money still unpaid. From what I have heard from electricians, the charges of this company constitute one of the biggest &#34; take-downs &#34; in connexion with the industry. No silent pictures are now manufactured. The showmen are obliged to install &#34; talkie &#34; apparatus, although many of the picture halls, particularly in the country districts, have not a sufficiently large patronage to justify the expenditure involved. The _ moving pictures and the motor car have revolutionized life in the back country, and country people are deserving of greater consideration in regard to picture films than is any other section of the community. If it is possible to do so, the Government should ascertain exactly what are the admittedly high profits made by these companies. There are two which have the showmen at their mercy, and, if the Government wishes to obtain revenue from films, it should devise means of making these companies pay more than they now contribute to the revenue in return for the enormous sums that they are. obtaining from this country. </para>

                        <para>. - I listened with interest to the speech of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> in support of this duty. He referred to senators who had been defeated at the polls by the foreign picture interests; but no such thing occurred. It is true that a few members in another place stood for the picture interests at the election in 1929; but no senators were up for election at that time. Surely, apart &#39;from that, no action taken by the picture interests at an election is a sufficient reason why they should be penalized under the tariff by this or any other government. Yet that is the idea which the Leader of the </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Senate expressed by his argument in this debate. I hope that the tariff will never be regarded as a weapon for political retribution, to be used against those whose policy is opposed to that of any government in an election fight. That would be a new policy in Australia, and one that I, having in mind a recent poll in Western Australia, would strenuously oppose. If I had no other reason for voting for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> requested amendment, which I shall support on its merits alone, I should certainly do so as a. protest against the policy of retaliation which was suggested by the right honorable gentleman&#39;s remarks. </para>
                    <para>What is the reason for a 200 per cent, increase of this duty? I have listened to the whole of this debate, and I do not know why the increase came about, if it were not in pursuance of the policy of retaliation. If the Tariff Board recommended it, the Minister has kept the fact quietly to himself. We are told, among other reasons, that the picture interests had certain honorable senators defeated at the polls two years ago, and here we have the duty on foreign films increased from 4d. to1s. a foot. We are informed that the Government has made a loss of &#163;100,000 a year over this matter ; but the Government, by its policy of high protection, has made possible the establishment of laboratories which give employment in the copying of films in Australia. Apparently, that is the kind of thing that the Government has been trying to do by its tariff policy generally. We have been told that this is beneficial, when we have urged tariff reductions, and have pointed out the great burden which the tariff imposes on producers and consumers alike. Has not this high tariff had the result of providing employment in the copying of films in this country? Yet the Minister complains that the picture interests have made profits up to 46 per cent. If we could get the true figures relating to the profits of all the over-protected industries that the Government has been propping up by means of the tariff, against the wishes of the Country party, it would be found that similar profits have been earned by many of them under the shelter of high duties. </para>

                            <para>- Well, secured. The attendances at picture theatres have decreased from 6,671,000 in 1930 to 3,838,000 in 1931, and to 2,142,000 in 1932, with a corresponding diminution in the amount of amusement tax collected. Naturally, the Government cannot have it both ways. It has put up the duty on films to a tremendous extent, thereby making possible the establishment of laboratories, which give employment to Australians in copying films, and now it complains that that result has been achieved. It is interesting to compare the rate of1s. a foot with the rates in operation in other countries. In Great Britain, with its huge population, the duty on negatives is 5d. a foot, and the earning power of films in Britain is, &#39; of course, several times greater than it is in Australia. In Britain, the film interests have only one tax to pay, and one government to deal with, whereas in Australia they come in contact with several governments, and have numerous taxes to meet. If the duty of1s. a foot is maintained it will seriously affect, not only the distributors and the laboratories, but also the picture theatre proprietors throughout the Commonwealth. There are 1,300 theatres in Australia, and with such a heavy duty as1s. a foot, unquestionably, . a considerably smaller number of films will be imported. The number of prints made in Australia will be reduced, and thus fewer films will be available for the theatres. </para>

                    <para>A further reason for the reduction of the revenue obtained from films has been the policy adopted by the Government. The greatly increased number of British pictures coming in free of duty must of necessity affect the revenue. I should be pleased if the revenue from foreign films had entirely disappeared, because that would connote a greater increase in the importation of British pictures. I should like to see British pictures control the whole of the market. Of course, I should also welcome more Australian pictures ; but, in the meantime, I am glad to know that the proportion of films coming from the Motherland is increasing. British picture producers have made tremendous strides in the last few years. </para>
                    <para>I draw attention to the position with regard to news reels. These are of educational value, and they are brought from all partsofthe world. They deal with items of,public interest, and under the present tariff, they will not be available to anything like the same extent in the future, because the duty of1s. a foot will keep them out. </para>

                            I regret that that suggestion has been made, because it shows a fundamental misconception of that for which the National party and the National Government stand. We are in the unique and enviable position in this House of representing all classes in the community, and of necessity, in our endeavours to do justice to all, our remissions of taxation have fallen upon all classes. The suggestion that ours is an electioneering budget is nothing less than an outrage and a gross misconception of the whole position.

We have had many great scientific developments of recent years, and the removal of the tax upon low-priced tickets should offer more abundant facilities for education to those who are best able to profit by them. The remission of the tax as proposed will benefit those who are least able to bear the charge upon the tickets which they have to purchase for entertainment which may be either relaxation or education to them. </para>

                            , I should certainly take notice of it, but I would be in a considerable difficulty as to how I could cope with it, though, no doubt, I should make a great endeavour to do so. These, broadly, are the reasons that have actuated the Government in submitting this motion. In my opinion, an entertainments tax is one of those things in which a. Federal Government, with a broad national policy, should not be concerned, and it was nothing but the obligations of the war  that brought the Commonwealth Government into this field of taxation.

The&#39; Labour party had no monopoly of the hoardings on the occasion to which the right honorable gentleman referred. Probably now that the Government is facing defeat at the hands of its own supporters, in respect to its proposed duty on films, it is looking for all the cover that it can find. If I were a pressman in the gallery, and were at all romantic, I should be pressing the lead at top speed through my gold pencil sending messages to my paper that the Government was about to be defeated on the duty on films. </para>

                    <para>In Camperdown, a plant has been installed at the cost of ?80,000 for the printing of positive films from the negatives that are imported. About 150 people are employed at those works. I suppose similar, establishments have been set up in the other States. The Government, apparently, sees itself in a jam, and wishes to get. out of it; but I do not think that it will succeed. I ask honorable senators to deal with this proposal in a spirit of fair play. It is an attack upon an amusement which benefits the great majority of salaried people in the city and country. The time has arrived when the Australian film industry should have a reasonable chance to establish itself and make good, and the Government should support any scheme that will lead to the attainment of that object. </para>

                        <para>. - It is desirable to put. one or two considerations to honorable senators before they make up their minds on this important matter. There appears to be a good deal of sympathy with the request that has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> because of the claim that has been made that it is intended to impose some charge on what is termed the poor man&#39;s entertainment. In common with every other honorable senator I have no desire that any further levy should be imposed upon picturegoers, and I venture to suggest that this propaganda under the guise of protecting the poor has as its object the protection of the rich. </para>

And that is the industry which some honorable senators seek to protect !
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline>
                        has pointed out that when the Scullin Government placed a tax of 4d. a foot on imported films, it was tricked by the importers. It is the opinion of many that the people who have established the duplicating industry in Australia are an offshoot of the foreign film distributing companies. This is merely another way of extracting tribute from the poor man, about whom some honorable senators appear to be so solicitous.

The departmental records show that the British industry is making excellent headway, and that if matters are allowed to continue as they are, they will make still further progress. But what is even more pleasing is the splendid chance there is of establishing a worth-while Australian industry. Honorable senators who support this request are actually helping the combine, which is importing films and duplicating and distributing them in Australia. </para>

                        quoted figures regarding the effect of the entertainments tax. Those figures have been tabulated by the film industry. According to figures taken from the report of the Commissioner of Taxation for the years 1928-29 and 1931-32, and covering the Commonwealth taxable admissions during those financial years, admissions to picture shows have decreased from 3,183,606 in 1928 to 2,142,734 in 1932. I remind honorable senators that they include only admissions priced at 2s. 6d. and over, as no entertainments tax is levied on lower-priced tickets, and, therefore, do not cover the huge bulk of admissions which are at lower prices. Undoubtedly, the picture shows have been hit considerably by the depression, but are we to carry this old man of the sea round our necks for all time?

                        also tricked the Scullin Government. Now, when a legitimate attempt is made to levy a duty in a way that does not justify any burden being passed on to the general community, honorable senators allow themselves to be bluffed by the suggestion that the charge &#39; will be passed on. I repeat that not one copper of this levy has yet been passed on, and I venture the suggestion that if that had been done it would have meant considerable trouble.

Suggestions have been made that the quota system should be adopted, and various other proposals have also been put forward. The Minister for Trade and Customs was good enough to send me a copy of the letter which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> addressed to him on the subject of excise. I have had that letter examined very carefully by officers of the Customs Department, and I have come to the conclusion that those engaged in the Australian filmproducing industry might well say, &#34; Save us from our friends &#34;. It would be found that the levying of excise duty on foreign films would be far more inconvenient to them than the levy proposed by the Government under the customs tariff. </para>

                            <para>- It would he very difficult for them to have excise officers exercising ordinary excise control over their business. The suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> was that an excise duty should be imposed on prints made from imported negatives, in addition to the old import duty of 4d. a foot. He suggested that the excise rate should be Jd. or f d. a foot. I do not think that the industry itself would willingly move in the direction of having an excise duty imposed, as it would be necessary to place an excise officer on the premises of each printing establishment, and submit the processes of manufacture to all the restrictions necessitated by the proper protection of the revenue. These restrictions are inseparable from an executive revenue control, and would prove particularly irksome in the case of the filmprinting industry. The way in which the honorable senator&#39;s proposal would work out in comparison with the present import duty of ls. a foot is illustrated in the following table: - </para>

                    <para class="block">The practice up to the present has been to make from six to eight copies of feature films in Australia from imported negatives. It will be observed from the figures quoted that, if eight copies are made, the loss to revenue as compared with the present proposal would be &#163;d. a foot, if the excise were -Jd. a foot. If the excise rate were fd. a foot, the loss would be  &#188;d.  a foot. If seven copies were made, the loss would be .64d. a foot and 3Sd. a foot respectively. If six copies were made, the&#39; loss would be .833d. a foot and .583 a foot respectively. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators, in their anxiety to do justice to what they claim as the poor man&#39;s entertainment, are allowing the distributors to get away in the smoke. There is no justification for penalizing the showmen except to a very small extent, and there is no justification for the showman to pass the impost on to those who attend his show, because it will be so very small. I do not think that the duty will ever be passed on to the  showmen at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> asked why, if we propose to place this extra duty on the film industry, the Government should not re-impose that portion of the land tax which was recently remitted. In answer to that, I ask honorable senators to choose between the land-holders and those controlling the cinema industry. If they do so impartially I have no doubt what decision that they will arrive at. </para>

                            <para>- The protests would probably have been made in any case. Many exhibitors are in a bad way now. I have seen letters from accountancy firms which handle the affairs of exhibitors, and it is clear from them that many exhibitors are finding the greatest difficulty in making ends meet. The reduced attendances account for this, and these in turn, are due to the reduced spending capacity of the people. No matter what we may say regarding the class of picture which, unfortunately, is sometimes exhibited, the people have been forced to patronize this form of entertainment because good music and good acting on the legitimate stage have been put out of their reach by high prices. I deplore as much as any one many of the films which are exhibited, but I am no more favorably disposed towards some of the literature to be found on the shelves of our libraries. No one suggests, however, that a special duty should be placed on this kind of literature. We have appointed censors to see that undesirable literature is not offered for sale in the Commonwealth. I doubt that the imposition of this heavy duty will have any effect upon the class of American films distributed in Australia. We must rely upon our censors to reject pictures which should not be shown before Australian audiences. I have been wondering whether, in view of the need for revenue, the Government has given consideration to any other proposal for the control of the motion picture business in Australia. In New Zealand, for example, films are not subject to import duty, and the Government obtains its revenue from licences issued to registered exhibitors who pay fees according to a scale prescribed by regulation. I have been unable to ascertain how the system is working in the dominion ; but as it has been in operation for some years, I assume that it has proved satisfactory, and it has occurred to me that similar action might be taken by this Government. </para>

                            <para>- Probably that limitation of power would prevent this Government from adopting the course followed in New Zealand. I am afraid that the imposition of this higher duty will not result in additional revenue being received by the Government, because the importing interests will continue the practice of printing in Australia from the positive film, and if the industry in Australia does not develop, the additional 8d. a foot duty charged to importers will be passed on to exhibitors, with the result that many people will be thrown out of  employment. Further taxation on exhibitors, especially in the smaller centres of population, will, I believe, force many of them to close their theatres. </para>

                    <para class="block">I go a long way with the Government in this matter because I believe that the Scullin Administration attempted to do what this Government now proposes to do, but the combine discovered a way by which it was able to dodge the duty. The whole of the picture industry in Australia is in the hands of a combine, necessitating drastic action to control it. I listened attentively to the remarks of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> who attacked the combine in terms which could hardly have been excelled by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> or any other honorable senator on this side of the chamber whose objection ta monopolies and combines is so well known; and I was in full sympathy with all that the right honorable gentleman said. But, when we look at this matter closely, we must ask ourselves whether the combine will not succeed, as it did on a former occasion, in dodging this duty. Many exhibitors are poor men. Despite the statement of the Minister in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline> McLachlan)  that we on this side were trading on our sympathies with the working classes, we naturally feel that it is our duty to look after their interests. The problem facing the Government bristles with difficulties. I would vote for the item if it could be shown that the Government would  collect  this higher duty from the combine; but we know, from what the exhibitors have told us, some of them being quite frank about the matter, that they are helpless,- and I am afraid that the Government&#39;s proposal will not be of very much assistance to them. </para>

                            <para>- To effectively deal with this monopoly, the Government should impose a drastic special profits tax of 10 per cent., 15 per cent., or 20 per cent. To me that would seem to be a straightforward way of dealing with these foreign picture interests, and if the Government brought forward a proposal on those lines, I would give it my hearty support. The requested amendment would, if carried, be referred to another place, which apparently passed this important item  practically without discussion, and I should like to know what would happen then. Doubtless the item would be referred back to the Senate, and we should certainly have more light on the subject than we have had Up to the present time. . I should like the Minister to tell us what this duty of ls. a foot would mean per programme to the ordinary country exhibitor - the man who is in the position of an ordinary working class trader, and whose profits, I imagine, are in the neighbourhood of &#163;5 or &#163;10 per week, though I doubt that some of them make so much as that. Even &#163;1 a week additional taxation would mean a good deal to a man in that position. At the moment we are without the necessary information to guide us. If the suggestion made. by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> to refer the matter back to the Tariff Board, were adopted, we should then get the fullest information. Personally, although as a rule opposed to the practice of appointing royal commissions, I would go so far as to support the appointment of a royal commission, which would make an investigation in much the same way as the petrol commission is now inquiring into the operations of the major oil companies in Australia; because I am satisfied that this foreign picture combine should be dealt with in a drastic manner. From my knowledge&#39; of certain gentlemen who are interesting themselves iD this matter., I feel confident that the combine has very good advocates in this </para>

                    <para class="block">Parliament and elsewhere, and its influence, although disguised in various ways, is felt in this chamber. I hope that when the Senate&#39;s request is dealt with in the House of Representatives the matter will be fully debated, so that our knowledge of the film industry in relation to public policy may be widened. Notwithstanding the <inline font-style="italic">ad</inline><inline font-style="italic">misericordiam</inline> pleas of the distributors regarding the small trade they are doing during the depression, I do not see why the price of admission to picture theatres should not be reduced.- During the boom period, one could obtain a seat in the cheaper parts of the house for not more than 6d. No doubt the advent of the sound films necessitated increased expenditure on plant, and in improving the acoustic properties of theatres. I have heard that the cost of installing sound apparatus in. some of the big theatres has been as high as &#163;40,000, but this figure is supplied by the . exhibitors who, no doubt, desire to impress the public in order to strengthen their claims to higher prices for admission. To-day, the cheaper seats cost ls. 6d. and 2s., and on Saturday nights one has to pay 5s. 9d. for a good seat in a city picture theatre. That is almost equal to the price formerly charged for high class drama performed by the best companies that visited Australia. A few years ago, one could purchase a seat in the back stalls for 2s. 6d., and hear a first class dramatic production, but the talkies have almost ousted other forms of entertainment, and now we are almost compelled to accept the fare which the Americans offer. </para>

                            <para>- I am game enough, but I am influenced by the frankly-expressed views of the exhibitors. I believe that even the so-called Australian producing companies are in the hands of the combine. After all, a company that desires to exhibit&#39; either a play or a film is entirely at the mercy of those who control the theatres. The metho&#39;d of attacking the combine adopted by the Government will merely result&#39; in the tax being passed on to the masses who will have to choose between paying higher prices for their entertainment or refraining from patronizing picture theatres. The Government should reconsider its policy, and endeavour to get the revenue it requires by a drastic special tax on the profits of the film combine. </para>

                        <para>. - I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacDonald</inline> on having tried to be fair. He said that this matter bristles with difficulties, but it does not appear to me to be more difficult than many other items in the schedule. Honorable senators have had no compunction about supporting increases on other imported goods, and the only real problem that I see in relation to films is that the increased duty will not be popular. We may be told that the films are the rich man&#39;s pleasure. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that they are the poor man&#39;s amusement; whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> has stated that they are practically the only entertainment available to the rural population. I do not concede that films are the particular amusement of any one section of the community. Pictures are patronized  by all sections  in the  city and the country alike. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> Said that the rich patronize the opera. If they are wise they will go to the opera, if there is one to go to, but I have found in both Melbourne and Sydney that it is difficult to find a play to attend. The newer form of amusement has practically displaced what, in my opinion, is a far superior form of entertainment. Almost every person in the community attends the motion picture theatre. I do so occasionally, although probably not so frequently as do most honorable senators. One morning recently, when in Melbourne, I attended the screening of <inline font-style="italic">Cavalcade.</inline> I looked with what I believe to have been an unbiased eye at the hundreds of people who were pouring into the theatre, and I did not form the impression that they were poor people ; and, therefore, I cannot agree with the suggestion that this duty is an attack upon the poor in the community. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I do not wish to associate myself in any way with the attack which has been made on the companies concerned. They have not badgered me. In that connexion, I have no criticism whatever to offer. They have approached me in a reasonable way. </para>
                    <para>I have also receive&#39;d a number of letters from country exhibitors. I think that the Minister was a little unfair when he suggested that these complaints have been fomented by the distributing companies. I do not think that they were. Rather am I of the opinion that the distributors felt that they would be hard hit, and that they protested for that reason. It is said that this duty is a revenue tax, and it is argued that a revenue tax is not justified when a surplus of about  &#163;3,000,000  is expected. That is an argument which has so frequently been ignored by honorable senators opposite that I did not expect to hear it from them to-day. The Government has to think of balancing its budget, and to that end it is entitled to consider what taxation it is reasonable to impose on the community. Invalid and old-age pensions cost this country between  &#163;10,000,000  and  &#163;11,000,000  a year, whereas the duty on these films in  1929-30  was approximately  &#163;300,000;  in the following year it was under  &#163;150,000,  and for  1931-32,  it was slightly over  &#163;50,000.  There is no reason why the people who go to see motion pictures whether rich or poor, or city or country dwellers - should not make some small contribution towards these pensions, or to the other outgoings in which the country may be involved. Since this is a revenue tax, and the Government is primarily the judge of the revenue it re quires, and, further, since no one has objected to an increased tax on lace, carpets and other goods for the purpose of raising revenue,  1  see no reason why amusements also should not be taxed. Amusements are in the nature of luxuries; no one is forced to attend the theatre against his will. I regard the duty as sound because it encourages British and Australian industries as against American industries. For some time there has been a growing feeling in South Australia in favour of British films rather than American, yet there is no need to disparage the products of the American film houses. <inline font-style="italic">Cavalcade,</inline> which I mentioned, was produced in the United States of America. Nevertheless, numbers of Australians prefer British films ; &#39; they like their sentiment, they find them better than American films, and they greatly appreciate the English accent. &#62; I shall support the Government in this duty, and I do not care that it happens to be an unpopular course which the Government is taking. I have no desire to be hard on any section of the people, particularly those in conntry districts in the matter of their amusements, but it does not appear to me that this is &#62;an unreasonable tax. Amusements should pay their fair contribution towards the general fund to meet the needs of the community </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter of opinion. If the honorable senator believes that the people who attend picture theatres are paying more than their fair share of taxation, he is entitled to vote against the Government&#39;s proposal. In my opinion, the tax on amusements cannot be regarded as excessive, particularly in view of the fact that, even in, these hard times, large numbers of people are found in our picture theatres every night. I shall support the Government, because I feel that amusements should pay their share of the expenses of the country. . </para>

If the Minister is prepared to introduce a bill to deal with combines, I am prepared to support him, but I shall not support a proposal for higher duties, which I know will be passed on at once to the patrons of the moving picture shows. </para>

                            <para>-That may be. It is probable that action to pass on the duty to the patrons of the picture shows will not be taken until Parliament has come to a final decision on the subject. So soon as the Parliament ratifies this duty, the prices to the public will be increased immediately. We cannot blame the distributors for taking such action, because under the Commonwealth customs law no contract can be voided if tariff increases are passed on. Any increased taxation in this direction, therefore, will have to be borne by the people who attend picture shows. If the Minister can evolve a scheme under which relief will be given to the exhibitors of films I shall be prepared to support it; but I am not prepared to support this increase of duty because, if agreed to, it would have to be borne by the people who attend the picture theatres. The following is an extract from a letter which I have received from a small pictureshow proprietor :  - </para>

                    <para>  As an example of this, I would mention that in one class of seat alone, should I have toincrease the price by1d., the public will have to pay 5d. so as to meet the additional State and Federal taxation. </para>
                    <para class="block">I do not quite follow those figures, but assume that they are correct. Therefore, any increase of duty would increase the cost of attendance at the picture shows.Fewer people would attend, and the amount collected from the amusement tax would fall considerably. The Commonwealth will lose revenue by the imposition of this duty. It will kill the goose that lays the golden egg. </para>

                            <para>- The figures show that the Commonwealth has derived considerable revenue from this source, and that during the last two or three years the revenue has been gradually decreasing because of the heavy taxation imposed upon the people. Picture patrons are using the cheaper seats, and in that way are not contributing anything towards Commonwealth revenue in the form of entertainments tax. I regret that I have to vote against the Government on this item, but I must do so really to ensure that the Commonwealth receives sufficient revenue under this item. I am informed that the supply of British films is at present not nearly sufficient for our requirements in Australia; but I would be prepared to consider the imposition of a deferred duty later on in order to give the British industry an opportunity to establish itself. </para>

                                was speaking, he stated that this extraordinary mass of correspondence with which honorable senators have been inundated during the last three or four weeks, was from one common origin. I take it that he meant that it emanated from the Yankee picture interests. I do not dispute that some of it may have come from that source, but much of it did not. I have been in close touch with many of the smaller exhibitors who operate in the country towns of Tasmania. I have known them intimately for years. In one town in Tasmania a picture show has been operated once or twice a week by an estimable lady whose husband gave his life for this country. She has written to me, and I have seen her personally. She has placed before me copies of the contracts which she has had to sign, not one, as was referred to by the Leader of the Senate to-night, but dozens; and they affect not only the Yankee picture distributors, but also British and Australian d distributors.  I assure honorable senators that the small country exhibitors, whether be shows Yankee, British or Australian pictures, gets it in the neck.

                                was speaking, the Minister in charge of the bill interjected that the Commonwealth does not derive any considerable revenue from amusements, because the entertainments tax- does not apply unless the tickets cost over 2s. 6d. Let me give an actual illustration of the tickets sold on Saturday, the 17th June, by one exhibitor in a country town of Tasmania. There were 55 tickets sold at ls. 8d., which returned &#163;4 lis. 8d. The Tasmanian Government took 18s. 4d. in amusement tax. There were 78 tickets sold at ls, 6d., returning to the exhibitor &#163;5 17s.. from which the Tasmanian Government took 19s. 6d. in amusement rax. There were 29 tickets sold at ls., returning to the exhibitor &#163;1 9s., from which 2s. 5d. was taken by the Tasmanian Government in amusement tax. The gross takings amounted to &#163;11 17s. 8d., of which the Tasmanian Government took &#163;2 Os, 3d,1 I have a certificate to that effect signed by the Taxation Department&#39;s inspector. Allowance has to be made for the sum of &#163;4 or more paid for the pic tures, as well as for the cost of lighting, door-keepers, machinery, and other items. There is precious little in it for the exhibitor. This letter was not inspired by Yankee interests, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate would suggest that all such correspondence is, but is a personal communication to me, dated the 20th June last. I am with the Government in its desire to deal with the foreign picture interests ; but* it has placed itself in an untenable tactical position. The endeavour has been made to convince honorable senators that the Government is out after those who have been evading taxation. I predict that this bomb or broadside will miss its target. The extra duty will have to be found by the exhibitors, who, according to their contracts, are bound hand and foot to the distributors. How are they to pay it? They must pass it on to the public by way of increased charges, because, from what I know of the business, they cannot stand any more. They have been in the most serious position for two or three years. The extra duty will not achieve the object intended. The certified figures supplied by the Taxation Department, and by chartered accountants, show that there has been a drop in attendances, gross takings, and so on, with a duty of 4d. The rate was increased from 3d. with the idea of obtaining additional revenue, but that purpose has not been achieved; revenue from this source has declined. Can anybody in his sober senses, contend that an increase from 4d. t6 ls. will produce more revenue? There is such a thing as saturation point, and it has been reached. The Government will not &#34; get at &#34; the American picture interests, hut will &#34; give it in the neck &#34; to good Australians like the lady I have mentioned. I have received another letter, also from a member of the fair sex, who runs a picture show in the Tamar Valley, in Tasmania. She was not instigated by Yankee picture interests, but acted on the principle of self-preservation. For the last seven or eight years, to my knowledge, she has been making a somewhat precarious living as a picture exhibitor. She exhibits every&#34; Saturday, sometimes on a Wednesday, and perhaps for a whole week at Christmas time. She is a good Britisher, and wishes to screen British pictures, but the best that the British film distributors could do for her was to supply her with sixteen productions during a period of twelve months. I have the contract before me. To make up her programmes, she has to obtain foreign films; and, if we agree to the duty proposed by the Government, she will have to pay it. She has supplied me with her last year&#39;s income tax return, certified by a chartered accountant in Launceston. On the figures that she has submitted, she has not &#34; Buckley&#39;s &#34; chance of making a living if she has to pay this additional charge, and consequently she will have to get it out of the rural population that patronizes her theatre; and you,

                                know as well as I do what sort of a spin the Tasmanian applegrower has had for some considerable time past. I am very much averse to voting against the Government on a revenue item. I wrote to my correspondents declining to commit myself, and stating that I would hear the Government&#39;s case before I came to a considered opinion. I have heard all that has been said on the subject to-night. I listened with the greatest interest to the Minister in charge of the schedule, and to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.Up to a point, I agree with many of the remarks of the latter gentleman; but I must join issue with him concerning the pernicious nature of many of the American productions. I regret that criticism on that score can be directed, not only against the Yankee, but also against British productions. I have seen some British &#34; talkies &#34; of which I was heartily ashamed, and that I would not like a lady friend, for whom I had any respect, to see. On the other hand, I have seen beautiful British works of art, in which the acting was restrained and natural. I have also seen some very fine American productions. An honorable senator to-night expressed the wish that the day might soon come when we would have nothing but Australian &#34; talkies.&#34; I cannot agree with him. These pictures are an expression of art, and I should like productions from all over the world to come to Australia. Some pre-war French and German pictures that I saw wereexcellent works of art.

                    <para class="block">If the Government must have additional revenue from films, I suggest that it be obtained in some way other than by placing the heavy duty of1s. per ft. on foreign films. I am convinced even by the case presented by the protagonists of this high duty that under it the small exhibitor will be penalized, because he is bound hand and foot to the film companies, which means that in the last analysis the public must pay. The entertainment of the people is already taxed up to the hilt. I have shown that in a small picture theatre in a country town, where the nightly takings amount to only &#163;11 odd, the tax collected by the State Government amounts to over &#163;2. </para>

These duties were increased by 20 per cent by the previous Government for revenue purposes. A further increase of 10 per cent, has been made in the general tariff rate to conform with the Ottawa agreement formula. The duties are in accordance with the ad valorem rates in respect of manufactures of paper or partly of paper having advertisements thereon. The object of the increase is to provide additional revenue, although in some of the lines covered by the item the incidence of the duties may be protective. As the importations are not recorded separately, no estimate can be given of the additional revenue which is likely to accrue from the higher duties. </para>

                    <para>. - In view of the mystery that seems to have enveloped the proposals submitted to the World Economic Conference in London for the restriction of  wheat production, I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> whether any further cablegrams have passed between Melbourne or Canberra and London on this subject, and also whether a statement can be made to clarify the position ? </para>

                    <para>&#91;11.9&#93;. - I have no further statement to make on this subject. I repeat what I have said on other occasions that, before any action could be taken which would involve Australia, the State Governments would have to be consulted, because they would have to implement any arrangement made for a restriction of production. </para>
