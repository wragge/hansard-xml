                        <para>Accusing Sir George Pearce of having charged him with questioning the appointment of Mr. F. W. Eggleston as  chairman  of the Commonwealth Grunts Commission for the purpose of " vote catching," Senator Johnston labelled the Minister for Defence as the " champion vote catcher of Australia." "I predict that this champion vote catcher will succeed in catching the majority of the voles in Cabinet when the position of High Commissioner is being considered," he added. </para>

                        <para>This indefatigable search for spicy items in the newspapers is indicative of most praiseworthy energy. All that I need say in reply to the honorable senator is, that the other day Senator Johnston " tipped " Sir James Mitchell as the nest Governor of Western Australia, but the Premier of that State has since denied that that is intended. I do not know whether Senator Johnston's latest " tip " will prove more nearly correct. </para>

                            <para>From  the  statement I made  to the  Senate yesterday afternoon,  the  honorable senator will have noticed that  the  arrangement made between Great Britain and the United States in reference  to  the June payment of interest on the British debt to America does not, in the opinion of the  President  of the United States, involve default. In these circumstances it is clear that the cabled report referred to was inaccurate. </para>

                            <para> No question of default by Australia can arise. I regret to note that though it has been repeatedly stated in the Senate that Great Britain has for the last two years, of her own volition, foregone both payment of principal and interest to the extent each year of the amount mentioned by the honorable senator, his question would appear to indicate that he is unaware of the fact. </para>

                        <para>- It is not customary to answer questions involving a disclosure of Government policy, hut there is no truth in the suggestion that Australia has defaulted in regard to her war debts. The honorable senator appears to be unaware that, owing to the generous action on the part of the British Government, Australia has not been called upon to make any payment during the last two years in respect of its war debt due to the British Government. </para>

                            <para>I have no official particulars as to terms or rates at which either Argentine or Northern Rhodesia floated loans in London. As I indicated to the honorable senator in reply to a similar question a few days ago, if any foreign or dominion borrower can obtain better terms on the London market, it is attributable, in a largo measure, to the unfortunate propaganda of the party with which the honorable senator is associated, and his leader, Mr. Lang. Australia's credit has been restored in London since the present Government came into office, so that our 5 per cent. stocks, which were then f76 18s. 9d., are now quoted at £104 10s. In the circumstances, the recent conversion loan in London in respect of which cash subscribers received only 41 per cent. of their applications, must be regarded as a signal proof of the further strengthening of Australia's credit in London. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall explain the position in relation to this clause as the Government sees it. When the delegates assembled at Ottawa, the Mother Country desired that, in some instances, preferences should be applied to the non-self-governing colonies, and submitted a memorandum of the commodities" in respect of which preferences were sought. The list as accepted is contained in schedule G of the Ottawa agreement, together with the degree of preference and the quantity limitations. There are three items which are not included in that schedule, namely, beeswax, butter, and carbonate of soda. Three other items have also been mentioned by honorable senators, cotton, sugar and tea, but no preference exists in respect of those three commodities, either under the Ottawa agreement or anywhere in the tariff schedule. There are about 55 non-self-governing colonies with which reciprocal trade arrangements may be made under the Ottawa agreement at the request of the Mother Country. </para>

                <para class="block">The reason for this provision was to give the Mother Country time to make the necessary application, and, in the meantime, not to impose the general tariff rate on the product of non-self-governing colonies. I could give other instances to honorable senators. I am confident chat they will admit that this is the easiest and simplest way to go about the matter. Some honorable senators may feel that it deprives Parliament of a certain amount of control, but under the Ottawa agreement these things have to be done, for they form part of the consideration given for the concessions that we have obtained. If the Senate were not to agree to this simple method of adjusting the matter, it would be necessary, whenever one of these tariff concessions was arranged, to introduce a bill for the purpose, which would have to be passed by both Houses of the Parliament. The department considered that as the matter was more or less a minor one, it was advisable to leave the implementing of the agreement to be done by proclamation. The point was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> and also by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> that schedule G of the Ottawa agreement is not exhaustive, and on examining it narrowly I am inclined to agree with the honorable senators, and it would appear that Great Britain can make requests for concessions in respect of commodities which are outside the list given in schedule G. At the same time these can apply only to the three items that I have referred to as being outside the schedule, and the other three items in respect of which no preference is given. It is unnecessary for Parliament to deal with every minor arrangement that may be made under the provisions of clause 9, as they will not be important in principle, and will not affect the protective incidence of the tariff, or interfere materially with our industries. In addition there will always be the <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> in the market which will be provided by the non-self-governing colonies for some of our products. </para>

                        <para>- The provisions of the clause do not go beyond the Ottawa agreement. This is the means that the department has devised to implement the Ottawa agreement. The Government of the day will be answerable if it makes a bad bargain in regard to concessions given to non-self-governing colonies and the goods imported from them. In making any preferential trade arrangements with those parts of the British dominions we cannot go beyond the provisions of the Ottawa agreement. I admit that that agreement is general in its term, but we have to regard it from a practical point of view and, as I have already pointed out, these commodities are either included in the schedule or belong to the six items to which I have referred. </para>

                <para>I ask the Senate to agree to the clause as it stands as embodying apractical, common-sense procedure. I fear that if it were limited in its application we should violate what we agreed to do at Ottawa. As I have already stated, if the Government of the day should do something extremely foolish in negotiating these reciprocal agreements, it would be open to parliamentary castigation. If any honorable senator still feels uncertain on the subject, I should be glad to hear his views, but having examined the requests that were made at Ottawa, and the. history of that conference, I am sure that this is the only really practical way to implement the agreement. </para>

I suggest that the clause be postponed until we have discussed a number of items covering tropical products with which Queensland particularly is concerned. I confess that I am somewhat in the dark as to the meaning of this clause. Looking at the list, I see that bananas are specially mentioned. </para>

                    <para>- We know where we are in relation to bananas, but not in the case of other items. For instance, what is the position in regard to rum made as a by-product of sugarcane? It may be that Australian rum, manufactured by white labour, will have to face the competition of rum produced by black labour in Eastern Africa. Already the rum distillers of Queensland have protested against the differing duties on rum and whisky. Queensland is concerned with the possibility of competition from the products of British protectorates in tropical regions. Commodities produced by white labour in Queensland are at a great disadvantage in competing with similar commodities produced by black labour in countries where the wages of adults are only a few shillings a week, and much less for children. Coco-nuts which are grown extensively in Queensland are also grown in a number of British protectorates, and there is danger of the Queensland industry being adversely affected. From time to time the menace to an unpopulated Northern Australia is pointed out, and if profitable production, under Australian conditions, cannot be engaged in there, the outlook for a larger population in that part of this Continent is not promising. We must also ensure that Australian industries will not be injured by the products of coloured labour in the Mandated Territories of Papua and New Guinea, and the growers of tropical fruits in Australia must be protected against unfair competition. Australians growing pineapples, mangoes, custard apples, sour sop and sweet sop, predict that their industry will be much greater in the future. Queensland is more concerned with this than are the southern States. I feel that I cannot give an intelligent vote on this clause until I have heard the discussion on the various items, particularly those connected with tropical industries. We, on this side, thank the Minister for the trouble he has taken to make the position clear, but we are not yet entirely satisfied, and therefore we think that he would do well to agree to the postponement of the item in order that the Senate may have further information presented to it. </para>

The <inline font-style="italic">World Almanac and Book of Facts</inline> for 1933 contains some valuable information in relation to Tanganyika, the Cameroon s and other British protectorates in Africa. For instance, it shows that they produce each year sugar to the value of over £5,000,000. </para>

It is evident, therefore, that slave conditions have not long been removed from these protectorates, so that any competition from them would seriously affect Queensland industries.

                    <para>. - Rather than postpone the consideration of this clause at this juncture, it would be well if honorable senators were to make their views known to the Minister, so that he could consider them. I am concerned chiefly with article 15 of the Ottawa agreement, particularly the words, " and also any preferences for the time being accorded to the United Kingdom if  His  Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom so request ". That provision refers to other matters than those set out in schedule G to the agreement. It is true that there is no preference in the case of sugar, because of the embargo, but I see great danger to the Australia banana industry. The duty on bananas is 2s. 6d. per cental British and 8s. 4d. foreign. Were Great Britain to ask Australia to accord a preferential rate of duty to bananas grown in any of the British protectorates we should have to grant it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, by the Attorney-General of New South Wales. In that ease the High Court decided against what, to a layman, is the clear meaning of the Constitution. State Governments are exempt from the sales tax on their purchases. If the Commonwealth makes an exemption with respect to one form of taxation which is not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, a similar exemption should be made in the matter of customs duties. This has always been a grievance with the smaller States, who have to purchase railway material, dredges for use in harbour work, graders for road-making, and machinery required for State electrical and other power plant, and other goods from abroad, all of which are subject to very heavy duties. </para>

                    <para>When extensive borrowings are associated with a high protective policy it is inevitable that a certain proportion of the money raised by loans abroad will find its way into revenue in the form of customs duty on goods imported by private persons and purchased with the proceeds of such loans; buta system under which, year by year, a considerable percentage of all State loans raised in London becomes ordinary Commonwealth revenue in Australia, demands grave consideration. </para>

                        <para>- I have included in the amendment municipalities and other governing bodies for theconsideration of the Senate, but if the Government objects to that part of it, I am prepared to confine the effect of the amendment to the importations of State Governments only. I have included local authorities in the amendment so as to bring about uniformity. It is true that, in some States, State functions are undertaken by the Government, but in other States they are placed in the hands of bodies such as Tramways Boards, Boards of Works, and local authorities. In some States the supply of electrical power is controlled by a board constituted by the State, but in Western Australia it is controlled by the Government. That Statehas now put in hand earth works for railways, but it is faced with the serious difficulty of finding the money with which to purchase rails. The earth works are being carried out so as to expend as much moneyas possible on labour. If this amendment is carried, the State Governments and local governing bodies will be able to expend on labour a large sum of money which is <inline font-style="italic">now</inline> being paid into the federal coffers. </para>

                    <para>. - This amendment, if carried, would strike at the very root of our protective system. It would have to be general in its application, or subject to such exemptions as are provided in the schedule to the tariff itself. I suggest that this is not the appropriate place for the moving of such an amendment, but as it will have to he considered sooner or later, I shall give to honorable senators a few reasons why it should be rejected. The amendment, if carried, would have a devastating effect upon the secondary industries of this country, because the Governments of Australia are probably the largest customers of many local manufacturers. While it may be true that it is bad book-keeping to build up Commonwealth revenue at the expense of the States, I feel that, having regard to the administration of the Customs Act, no great injustice is being done. I have previously debated this question with an eminent engineer, who was also eminent in other directions, and who has, unfortunately, now passed away, in regard to a large governmental undertaking in Victoria. As has been shown by figures produced in the House of Representatives recently, generous exemptions have been made in instances in which the goods required were not made in Australia. That is and has been the policy of the Commonwealth Government for a number of years. Some of the States have undertaken trading operations in competition with private enterprise. Victoria, for instance, has an electricity commission, which, in addition to supplying electric light to the public, has a shop or warehouse at which electrical equipment can be purchased. South Australia has a large meat works, a cold storage works, and other similar establishments. Surely honorable senators will not argue that State Governments which are engaged in trading operations should have an advantage, in respect of the tariff, over private enterprise engaged in similar operations. Western Australia is operating a saw-mill, a meat works, and a shipping line, and at one time it engaged in the manufacture of agricultural machinery. Under the amendment, all those State enterprises would benefit, to the disadvantage of other States in which similar functions are carried out by private enterprise. The amendment would destroy the principle of equality of trading between States, and would be the thin end of the wedge bringing about the economic disruption of this country. I have had no time to ascertain the relative imports of the State Governments, or, what is more important, the relative use by the States of articles which are manufactured in this country, such as engines, machinery, and iron and steel goods, which are used in large quantities by State Governments or semi-governmental institutions like the railways. </para>

On this netting the Commonwealth Government imposed a duty, which the Government of New South Wales refused to pay. Then, as one of those vote-catching excursions, with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> familiarized us yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers sent his officers to the wharfs where the wire netting was lying, and forcibly took away a roll of it in defiance of the Commonwealth customs officers.  There  was a State election looming at the time, and the average elector got the idea that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> had himself gone down to the wharf and risked being shot in order to make this demonstration. On the strength of that, he won the election, having made it appear that he had wrested the goods from the grip of an arbitrary and despotic Commonwealth Government. At that time the Commonwealth was looked on as the natural enemy of the States. Eventually, the matter went to the High Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers lost the case, and the State had to foot the bill. </para>

                <para>There are certain dangers inherent ' in this proposal. The only way in which we can safeguard the position is to lay it down that the concession is not to be granted if the goods can be obtained in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- There is a danger, under present conditions, of unfair discrimination between one authority and another when it comes to obtaining a concession. Some- authorities have a way of stating their ease, and of either getting or manufacturing evidence, which would enable them to obtain this concession, where others more straightforward would fail. I should prefer that such matters should be regulated by statute rather than ministerial decree. Local-governing bodies should be encouraged to spend their revenue within Australia, and in this way develop the areas they control. I know from experience, however, that, many municipal authorities go out of their way to import goods, without ever taking the trouble to get quotations from Australian manufacturers. I am in favour of trading by State governments and local bodies; but I cannot agree to the encouragement of such trade if it will lead to the breaking down of our protectionist system, and the injury of Australian industry. Every effort should be made to supply our wants with Australian-made commodities before we seek to import goods from abroad. Unless this is done, I shall feel disposed to offer the most positive and strenuous opposition to the proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae. Senator Johnston's</inline> request was placed before the Senate all nicely dressed up with apple sauce in order to make honorable senators think that it was quite harmless, and, indeed, something desirable. When honorable senators on this side were fighting in the interest of Australian industries, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> was silent. State Governments and local governing bodies spend millions of pounds annually, and we should endeavour to see that as much as possible of it is spent, in Australia so as to provide employment for Australian workmen. Honorable senators should not consider this proposal for a moment. The real effect of it  would be to admit under specially favorable conditions the products of cheaplabour countries. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> with that fervid patriotic outlook of his, and supported by the Dominion League of Western Australia, may believe that the goods so admitted will come to us wrapped in the flags of the Empire, which he would regard as justification for his action. In my opinion, however, this request is the thin edge of the wedge. I protest against the lack of notice we have had in regard to it. It has been placed before me only within the last twenty minutes. I hope honorable senators will not allow themselves to be deceived in respect to a matter which involves the expenditure of millions of pounds. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> told his story very courteously and convincingly, but the proposal, if agreed to, would adversely affect the classes I represent. We have to ask ourselves whether this request really emanated from the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline></para>

In my opinion, the whole proposal reeks of cheap labour. The honorable senator has made an endeavour to persuade members of this chamber to attack the Government in an effort to secure the admission, free of duty, of the products of sweated labour. I object to that, no matter whether those products come from within the Empire or from without it. There are parts of the black country in England where the workers are neither more nor less than sweated chain gangs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bae</inline> and myself, in the name of our group, intend to vote against any request for the introduction of goods produced by sweated labour, whether they come from Britain, Japan, or anywhere else. </para>

                    <para>. - Personally, I have a great deal of sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "</inline> Secessionist " Johnston in this matter, because his proposal represents another attempt to escape from the disabilities suffered by certain States under federation. I do no't think that it has been made because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> and those who support him, desire to admit free of duty the products of sweated labour overseas. I know that some of our economic enemies would be prepared to do that if they thought they could gain anything from it, but, in this case, I believe the proposal to be prompted by a desire to lessen the disabilities suffered by those States -which are less highly developed in an industrial sense than are some others. They have to pay more for their requirements than has been paid in the past. Moreover, it is wrong in principle that the Federal Government should get an advantage through the customs when a State raises a loan overseas. Still, we on this side cannot support this amendment, because it would have a disastrous effect on many of our secondary industries. Municipal bodies and similar authorities have purchased goods overseas in order to save money; but the Labour party believes that it would be better in the long run to pay a little more for locally-produced goods in order to keep our own people in employment. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> provided a safeguard whereby the amount charged as customs taxation might be paid into the coffers of the States concerned, the amendment might have something to recommend it. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not intend to support the amendment, because it would prove injurious to the workers in secondary industries. The arguments that can be adduced in support of the amendment merely show the wisdom of the fiscal beliefs and general policy of the Labour party. We stand for the socialization of industry, production, distribution, and exchange, and under such a system an amendment of this kind would be unnecessary. We are also in favour of an absolutely prohibitive tariff. I have been misrepresented on that point. What I said was that I would make it a penaL offence to import any article that could be produced in Australia, equal in quality to that manufactured elsewhere, and at a reasonable price. If that principle were in operation, it would be foolish to require public bodies to pay duty on the goods that they require in providing services needed by the community. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has, apparently, overlooked what a powerful instrument his proposal, coupled with the safeguards suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes),</inline> would be in the hands of the Labour party.

                    <para>. -  This is an interesting subject, and it opens up a whole series of considerations. I can imagine opposition to the proposal on account of the condition of the public finances, but I did not anticipate a wholesale attack upon it by labour senators. From one point of view, the principle embodied in the amendment might be regarded as of benefit to the whole community. In a sense, it might be claimed to provide for a form of State socialism. Our friends on the Opposition side refuse to accept a suggestion intended to benefit the community as a whole, and they oppose it for the benefit of private interests. I shall discuss this matter from several aspects. One good argument in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston's</inline> proposal is the fact that, under the present system, the Federal Government is placed in a most advantageous position in comparison with the governments of the States, though each of them has a representative of the King at its head. Under the Constitution, any requisites purchased overseas for the purposes of the Federal Government are admitted duty free, because it is merely <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> matter of transferring the customs charge from one department to another; but a State Government has to pay the same duty as would be payable by an ordinary citizen. That, obviously and immediately, gives the Federal Government a tremendous advantage over the State Governments; in reality, it results in taxing the State Governments, and, through them, all the people who are resident in those States. That, in itself, at once raises the question whether there was an intention when federation was established that Commonwealth departments should be free from this particular form of taxation, which has become increasingly heavy from year to year, while the State Governments should be subject to it, particularly at a time when most of them are just able, if able at all, to pay their way. </para>

                        <para>- Ordinarily the manufacturers of this country enjoy a treble protection. They have, first, the protection afforded by our very high tariff; secondly, that afforded by exchange; and, thirdly, that afforded by what might be called public sentiment. The effect of the last-mentioned class of protection is that frequently preference is given to articles produced in Australia, if they even approximately approach the quality and price of similar imported articles. 1 think that this form of sentimental protection has* been stretched to the point at which it is exaggerated and undesirable. When a high duty is imposed on an article by the body constituted to determine what duties should be imposed, I do not think that there is any justification for a municipality or a shire council to add. another 12 per cent, or 20 per cent, preference for local goods. If the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> - and I am speaking now respecting articles imported " for use by the government of a State " - were carried, the first measure of protection, namely, the high tariff, would disappear; but exchange and public sentiment would still remain. We have been told frequently that there is a possibility that the exchange will disappear; but exchange has been pegged at its present point for about eighteen months, and prior to that, time it was higher than it is now. Personally, I cannot see any reason to assume that exchange will disappear in the immediate future - 1 wish I could. 1 believe that, if the amendment were agreed to, adequate protection would still be provided for the local manufacturers in the case of manufactured, goods for use by State governments, for primage and exchange as well as sentimental interest would  romain important factors. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I have been discussing only the major items, and have omitted quite a number of smaller ones. The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has, in a modified form, a good deal to commend it,' especially in respect of those States which at present feel that they are being " put upon " by our protective policy, for they would he able, if they so desired, to import goods which are manufacturable and manufactured in Australia only at excessive figures. The manufacturing States, on their part, would not be hampered, though they might be hoist with their own petard. Victoria, for example, would he able to buy engines manufactured in that State. Incidentally, I may say that I bought a Victorian engine some years ago, and have found it to be an excellent article. The people of Queensland, to carry the argument a little further, would still he able to eat all their own bananas ! A provision of this kind would adjust things more equitably among the States. The States which believe in lower tariffs could buy British goods if they thought the duties were too high, while the States which believe in higher duties could buy local goods for the price at which they were available. The terms of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston's</inline> amendment are too wide, in my opinion. While I do not disregard the claims of the municipalities and shire councils, I think that a provision of this kind should be limited to the State governments. I also suggest that the amendment should be limited to British goods, and that, therefore, it should be altered to read - </para>

                    <para>Notwithstanding anything contained in this act, British goods imported by the government oi a State  and so on. If that alteration were made, it could not be objected that the way was being opened for an influx of goods from foreign countries with a low standard of living. Such an amendment would also enable the State governments to place a check on the very high prices that they have to pay at present for certain goods. The debate on this issue may be crystallized into two conundrums. First - and this one may lie put to the Government - " Does equity depend on the state of federal finances?" Secondly - and this may be put. to the Labour party - " Is the manufacturer more important than the State?" The whole issue turns on those two questions, and I hope that I shall hear something from honorable senators in answer to them. </para>

                <para>I should like now to say a word on a subject which the Minister mentioned in such a way as to suggest that he thought that he was disposing of it finally, but which I think he has not finally disposed of. This is whether the Government, does always exempt from duty all goods which cannot be manufactured in Australia. We all know, from our experience in our private, as well as our representative, capacity, that a good deal of dispute arises from time to time in respect of the importation of articles which, it is said, are manufactured in Australia. When a question of this nature arises, the Minister undertakes to find out whether the goods are manufactured here. We all know thai decisions in such matters are sometimes hung up for months, apparently for inquiries to be made from the people who purport to manufacture such articles, as to whether they really do manufacture them. Some years ago I took part iu a debate in another place respecting the duty payable on certain imported locomotives. I suppose locomotives would bc involved to a considerable extent if this amendment were agreed to; but I do not think that the financial position of the States is such that there is any likelihood that many locomotives will be imported in the near future. Ali the States, I think, will continue using their old rolling-stock for some time to come. Early in 1926, the Government of South Australia imported 30 locomotives from overseas and applied for a remission of duty on them on the ground that such locomotives were not commercially manufactured in Australia. I took the subject up in another place, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Barwell took it up in the Senate. Our efforts to obtain a remission of duty in this case were defeated in each chamber. I refer honorable senators to <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Debates,</inline> volume 113, at page 2031, on which I am reported to lui ve said - </para>

                </para>
                <para class="block">The South Australian Government was called upon to pay, and actually did pay, the amount of duty in question, but subsequent to the debate in Parliament the Government changed its mind, and the duty paid on ten of the 30 locomotives was remitted. Tenders had not even been offered in Australia for those ten locomotives. As a matter of fact, they were the biggest locomotives that had been manufactured up to that time in Great Britain. They were made from American designs. The State Government obtained a remission of over £50,000 paid in duty on those ten engines ; but no remission was made of the duty paid on the other twenty engines. Of course, that amount of duty was added to the railway liabilities of the State, and is part of the railway burden which it has been carrying ever since. By interjection I made a reference the other night to the words " commercially manufactured." These words should mean that the goods have been actually produced in Australia at a merchantable price; but they were interpreted by the Government at that time to mean "manufactured at all." I-hope that they will not be so interpreted by this Government. </para>

I think it can be said that there is no State industry in Australia which i.i run at a profit; and in my opinion, there never will be one so run. I will go further, and say that it was never contemplated that some of the State enterprises established by Labour governments would be run at a profit. Perhaps a proviso could be added to the amendment to meet the point that I am making. But I have seen so many off-hand amendments work so much evil, that I confess that I can only suggest the lines upon which such an amendment could be drafted.

I do not wish it to be inferred that we desire to insert in the bill a clause which will make the purchase of cheap material possible for those persons who are acting in direct detriment to the manufacturers operating in Australia; or that we wish to encourage State industries which cannot, in my opinion, taken in the bulk, do anything but embarrass the finances of the State in which they arc operating. After a very long knowledge of the business of this Parliament, and previously of a State parliament, I think that all those State industries which have been running to the detriment of private people have involved the States concerned in extremely heavy losses ever since they started. Many such ventures, including fish shops, butchers' shops, and milk rounds have been abandoned, while those that have been retained do not benefit the finances or redound to the credit of the State which employs them. </para>

                        <para>- One should not generalize with regard to State socialistic schemes. What I have said has everything to do with the amend,ment, because, if it were adopted, it would confine the concessions in customs duties to those State Governments which carry on undertakings for State or public authority purposes only. From my experience, governments are very culpable in engaging in this business of industrial undertakings, and it has not been confined to governments of a particular political brand. Many administrations have willingly inherited State business ventures from governments of different political colour which initiated them. That is a grave error, and. one to be deprecated. In the circumstances, I venture to think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> will agree with the idea which I am endeavouring to convey, and I ask him and other honorable senators to rid themselves of any objections which they might have to my proposal on the ground of its faulty draftsmanship. In its present form, it merely gives an idea of what I have in mind, namely, that the pro posed concessions should not be made to apply to those Government ventures which are known as State industries. We must, of course, maintain such State socialistic enterprises as the postal department and railways, but further than that, I do not think we ought to go. </para>

                    <para>.- I find it a little difficult to determine what should be my attitude to the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> owing to the fact that, although I am in sympathy with the principle underlying it, I think that, in its general terms, it is much too wide. In Tasmania, we had an unfortunate experience in connexion with our hydro-electric department for which we imported heavily of essential machinery which could not be manufactured in Australia, and upon which we were obliged to pay heavy customs duties. After strong representations had been made to the Commonwealth Government, we did succeed in getting a refund of a small , portion of the duty ; but by that time the major portion, of the expenditure had been incurred, and as the refund was made retrospective to a certain date only, the customs duty paid  On  the bulk of the machinery was not repaid to the State. We considered this treatment by the Commonwealth Government distinctly unfair, especially as practically the whole of the machinery for the Yallourn scheme, for which the Victorian Government was responsible, was admitted free of duty. This was a sore grievance with the Tasmanian Government for a long time, but it has since been, rectified to a certain extent. In more recent years, the Commonwealth Government has been inclined to treat more sympathetically applications for the admission, under departmental by-law, of machinery which cannot be commercially manufactured in Australia. Although there was no possibility of manufacturing in this country the machinery required for the hydro-electric scheme in Tasmania, that State was compelled to pay customs duty upon the greater part of it. Public bodies throughout Australia now prefer to purchase all their requirements in Australia. This is particularly the ea.se in Tasmania, where preference ranging from, I think,  10  per cent, to  15  per cent., is given in favour of Australian manufacturers, for all requirements of State and local-governing bodies, apart altogether from the advantage given by way of exchange and other charges. Some of the money borrowed for the hydroelectric scheme was obtained from the Commonwealth, and as the State Government had to pay a considerable sum in the form of customs duties on imported machinery, portion of the amount covering that payment was withheld. I have a good deal of sympathy with the proposed further amendment outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> and would give it support if it could be shown that the goods,' in respect of which exemption from customs duties was claimed, were imported by a State Government, not for the purpose of sale oi' for competitive business, but solely for State needs. If that provision could be made, the proposal would receive favorable consideration. But I do not agree with the idea of exempting the requirements of all public bodies. </para>

It is essential, in the interests of the revenue, that action to collect duties levied under the earlier schedules should be validated. Clause 14 does that. Under earlier tariff proposals, higher duties have been collected in respect of some items than are chargeable in this schedule, so, unless the action of the Customs Department were validated, serious complications would arise due to the necessity to make refunds. These are the provisions which are made when passing a new tariff schedule. Clause 15 provides for the cessation of the operation of certain tariff proposals. The schedules which have been operative up to the present time, now give place to the one contained in this bill. Clause 16 validates the collection of any higher rates of duty in this schedule as originally introduced, compared with variations made by Parliament.

                    <para>. -  Honorable senators will recollect, that I had circulated, for their information, a customs tariff memorandum showing rates of duty under items in this schedule, as compared with <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> the rates of duty operating immediately prior to the introduction of the customs tariff proposals of October, 1932; <inline font-style="italic">(1&gt;)</inline> the  rate3  of duty under the Scullin Government's validated tariff; and (c) the rates of duty under the 1930-31 tariff. Those were circulated nol. only for the convenience and information of honorable senators, but also in order that, if the committee is agreeable, we may proceed to discuss the items under certain groups and headings, each item in a group having a principle common to all others in that group. Upon my motion, the Senate agreed to that memorandum being referred to the committee. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I think it only proper at this stage to re-state the method that has been employed in the arrangement, of these groups. But, first let me say that each of the items in the schedule to the bill itself is to be found in the group to which it properly belongs. That will enable the  committee to discuss all the items that are governed by one principle. This procedure was adopted in another place, and met with the approval of all parties, because it facilitated discussion and saved a considerable amount of time. I wish honorable senators to understand, however, that I have no desire to limit discussion, and that they are at liberty to debate any item. </para>
                <para>Group 1 contains 532 items, the rates upon which are the same as those that operated under the 1921-30 tariff. They were included in the tariff of the Bruce Page Government or its predecessors, and, so far, have not been touched by any subsequent government. </para>
                <para>Group 2 consists of 241 items that have been amended in accordance with the Ottawa agreement, but not otherwise. They are in exactly the same category as the items in group 1, with the exception that increases in the general tariff have been made. </para>
                <para>In group 3 there are 97 purely revenue items, which are not included under any other heading; but, in some cases, an item falls under another classification, because it has been dealt with in some form or other. </para>
                <para>Group 4 contains 193 items amended by the Scullin Government with the support of Tariff Board reports. </para>
                <para>Group 5 comprises 185 items to which amendments have been made by the present Government with the support of Tariff Board reports. </para>
                <para>In Group 6 there are 85 items that were amended by the Scullin Government without the support of Tariff Board reports. These are at present being examined by the Tariff Board, and amendments may have to be requested with respect to them, in accordance with reports received since the measure left another place. I believe that about a dozen such reports have already been dealt with by Cabinet, and, where revenue considerations permit, honorable senators will have an opportunity to discuss them. </para>
                <para>Group 7 gathers up all the other miscellaneous items, numbering 442, of which I believe that 19 are in the  same  category as the items in group 6; that, is to say, they are Scullin duties which are not supported by Tariff Board reports. I am not sure whether any of them has as yet been covered by a report of the board. </para>
                <para>On the basis of the calculation that I have made, there is a total of 1,775 items. I move - </para>

Similarly, if requests are made for lower rates, that, for the lowest rate Will receive first consideration. </para>

Under the regime of either the Bruce-Page Government or the Scullin Government, an application to deal with molasses was made to the Tariff Board; but, since the whole of the sugar industry was not behind the application, it was decided that nothing should be done.

The duties on these sub-items should be considerably increased in order to develop in Australia a fish-processing industry. In Queensland, the firm of Foggitt, Jones and Company is making a determined effort to put fish products on the market, and I suggest that that firm, and others engaged in the processing of fish, should be encouraged by the imposition of higher duties on imported fish products. </para>

                    <para>.- The importation of oranges and lemons was prohibited by the Scullin Government on and from the 4th April, 1930, as part of its scheme for rectifying the then adverse trade balance. When the present Government removed  the  embargo in September last, protests were made by the citrus-growers against that action. Let me point out that these embargoes were not associated with the tariff policy of the previous Government, and that fact was admitted by the Minister of the day when introducing the measure. Therefore, no one could object to the present Government's action on the ground that the grower's protection was being removed. It has already been pointed out, and I wish to reassure honorable senators, that in this Government's opinion the tariff is the proper medium for the protection of industry. In view of  the  protest, made by the growers, the question has been referred to the Tariff Board as to whether any alteration of the duties on citrus fruits is necessary. With regard to the embargo placed by New Zealand on the importation into that country of Australian-grown citrus fruits, f wish to say that a statement will be made at the appropriate time on that matter. In 1931 we exported to Canada 265 centals of lemons, valued at £184, and to Great Britain 6,674 centals, valued at £6,409. There were exports to other countries worth a few hundred pounds. The value of our exports of oranges was, to the United Kingdom, £261, to Canada £20,775, to New Zealand £73,000, and to the Netherlands, British Malaya, Hong kong, and Ceylon, amounts varying from £S00 to £2,250. That is the position in regard to the citrus fruit industry, and the Tariff Board is now considering to what extent it needs protection. </para>

                    <para>. - Item 56 covers ginger in various forms. I cannot understand why a prohibitive duty should not be imposed on the importation of this commodity in order to develop its production in Australia. It is easy to say that the successful development depends upon those engaged in the industry; but no person is likely to make a consistent attempt to produce such commodities unless he receives sufficient encouragement by the way of high protective duties. Ginger as grown and processed in Australia is equal to that produced in any other part of the world. Perhaps the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> cangive the committee some information on the subject. </para>

                <para>A departmental inquiry was conducted recently with a view to ascertaining whether the industry had shown sufficient developmentto warrant a further in- quiryby the Tariff Board. The Chief Instructorof the Queensland Department of Agriculture advised that the area under cultivation was twelve acres at the. maximum, consisting of holdings ranging froma few perchesto one acre. The present production based on the average yield of 4 tons to the acre, would not be more than 48 tons Potential employment is not great. One acre would keep one attendant half-occupied during its cultivation, as the crop is grown under mulch. Ginger is planted in November and harvested about April or May. Therefore, at the present rate of production, half-time employment would be given to twelve men for about six months each year. </para>
                <para>Australian requirements of ginger in all forms are about 1,000 tons- per annum. The local industry is in a position to supply only a fraction of the demand, and then only in a. form not acceptable to manufacturers. The growing of ginger in Queensland is not undertaken as a main crop,but only as a side line. There is, therefore, little likelihood of Australian requirements being met for many years to come. </para>

                        <para>. - The Minister's remark that the production of ginger is only a sideline will, probably, also apply to honey: but if our rural industries are to develop, the production of these sidelines should he encouraged. Surely it is not suggested that farmers or settlersshould go on the land merely for the purpose of increasing land values, and that, after obtaining the benefit of unearned increment created by community action, they should leave their holdings? We need a yeoman population capable of producing anything that can be grown in this country. Honey may he a sideline, but it is now produced in Australia in considerable quantities, and I cannot understand why heavy duties are not imposed to assist the local producers of this commodity. The production of honey should be regarded as a good sideline for those engaged in rural pursuits. </para>

Thousands of pounds have been spent in the establishment of the industry in the north. I have seen the factory which has been built at Kinguroy. I know the work that is being done there, and I know the men and women who are growing the peanuts. The Queensland Government is, at the present time, prosecuting an extensive programme for opening up the fertile lands in the northern parts of the State. On the Cook River, and on the Dain tree, peanuts can be grown better than anywhere else in the world. I stand for an . absolutely prohibitive tariff on peanuts. We should return to the position which obtained before the present Government, interfered with these duties. </para>
