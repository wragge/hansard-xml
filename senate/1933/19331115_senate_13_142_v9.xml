To the report of the discussion, the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> appended a footnote stating that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Penton</inline> had not 'been expelled from the association. In consequence of that statement, I deemed it desirable that the matter should be cleared up, as I was one of those who had been criticized by this journalist. I, therefore, as a member of the committee of the Australian Journalists' Association, wrote the following letter to the secretary of that organization: - Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, tu</inline> the discussion in the Senate concerning press attacks on members of the Federal Parliament concerning the recent part restoration of salary reductions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> Penton's conduct as a journalist was referred to. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> stated that Penton had been expelled from the Australian Journalists' Association for nonpayment of dues. In a foot-note to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> the editor stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Penton</inline> had not been expelled, thus making out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> had lied.

                        <para>The total amount of contributions to the League of Nations in arrears at 31st December, 1932, was £949,952 gold out df total budgets amounting to £12,774,881. The percentage was 7.44. The States which had not completed the payment of contributions numbered 28, most of which are assessed on the basis of a very smallnumber of units; ten being assessed at only one unit each out of a total of 1,013 units. </para>
                        <para>It will probably be found that many of the 28 States were in arrears only by reason of delay in payment. </para>
                        <para>It  is  not considered that the position as regards arrears of contributions of some States' is such as would  justify  discontinuance by Australia of membership of the league. </para>

The board recommended that the adjustment be made, not only on goods from Great Britain, but also on those from sister dominions, and from foreign countries whose currencies were appreciated in relation to sterling. The bill we are now discussing gives effect to the Tariff Board's recommendation so far. as Great Britain is concerned, and to that extent I commend it, but no reason has been given why the board's recommendation is not being followed in full, although the declared policy of the Government is to accept the guidance of the Tariff Board in matters of this kind. </para>

In his policy speech, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> declared that, when framing its tariff policy, the Government intended to be guided by the recommendations of the board. But in this instance it is not doing so, although the recommendations could  be given effect without prejudicing Australian secondary industries. The Government's inconsistency is the more amazing because of the views expressed by the Minister in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan),</inline> when he was in Opposition. At that time he was one of the greatest protagonists of the principle that, in tariff matters, the Government .should accept the recommendations made by the Tariff Board. I well remember a speech delivered by the honorable gentleman on the 5th November, 1931, when the Senate was discussing the tariff proposals of the Scullin Government. In the brief time at my disposal I shall not he able to read the whole of his speech, so I shall have to content myself with a number of extracts, which, I believe, correctly interpreted the views then held bv the Vice-President of the Executive Council on this subject.

                <quote>
                    <para>It will be asked why the Government has confined the adjustments to goods dutiable under the British preferential tariff, and failed to extend them to foreign goods dutiable under the general tariff. Those honorable senators who may be disposed to press for the extension of the adjustments, should bear in mind that, in this proposed legislation, we are breaking new ground, and that we are entering into fields that, so far, have not been freely surveyed. I believe that Australia is the only country which has made a reduction of duties to counteract the protection afforded to industries by an adverse exchange. This action is all the more noteworthy because it is being taken at a time when other countries are engaged in raising the barriers against imports. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators will more readily appreciate the significance of the Government's decision not to apply the exchange adjustments to goods imported from foreign countries if I explain that the principal function of an exchange Tate is to equalize costs between any two countries. Comparative costs between such countries are, therefore, brought into proximity by the rate of exchange. In respect of a. large number of foreign countries, however, there exist no data relating to costs, wages and other charges, which would enable us to ascertain whether the exchange rate between Australia and a foreign country is a natural one or a managed one. If the former, an adjustment might safely be made; hut, if it is a managed rate, the costs of production in the foreign country might be much lower  than  they would be if the rate were a natural one. If, then, on account of exchange on that foreign country, a substantial ' allowance is made from duty, and if the costs of production in that country have not been increased by reason of the fact that the exchange rate is not a natural one, it will lie readily appreciated that Australian industry will be exposed to undue competition, assuming, of course, that the general tariff rate is reasonably protective. </para>

The war of tariffs is being superseded by a war of exchange rates. As I stated in my speech, when we consider the pioneering nature of this legislation, the danger of wide and general application of the adjustments to many countries, about which we have very little definite information, will be appreciated. We have  access to all the information that we require regarding the position in Great Britain, but we have little or no information about foreign goods. </para>

                        <para>- If that is so, a manifest error on the part of the hoard has occurred. A few days ago I gave honorable senators a specific example of the rates on a protected line of goods. The British duty was 40 per cent, and the general rate 60 per cent., leaving a preference of 20 per cent., which conforms with the margin agreed to at Ottawa in respect of commodities in that particular range. If the amendment were accepted the result would be that one-fourth of the duty or one-eighth of the value for duty, whichever is the less, would he deducted. This would mean that protected goods imported from the United Kingdom would bie dutiable at 40 per cent., less exchange adjustment 10 per cent., making the net duty 30 per cent. Protected goods imported from the United States of America would be dutiable at 60 per cent., but after deducting 12£ per cent, for exchange adjustment, the net duty would be 47 £ per cent., and the margin would he reduced to 17£ per cent. The honorable senator cannot have it both ways. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to say that in this matter the Tariff Board has taken into consideration the margins of preference under the Ottawa agreement ; but the honorable senator's amendment is not in accord with the board's recommendation, as it would apply the exchange deductions to the full foreign rate. A similar line of argument was followed in the other branch of the legislature by the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson).</inline> Is it not better that we should have an opportunity to bargain with those countries concerning whose economic conditions we can obtain full information, giving them tariff benefits in return for concessions which they accord to us? If the position is left as the Government desires, this legislation will be a powerful weapon to he employed in defence of the interests of primary production and other export industries. Even if we accepted the recommendations of the Tariff Board <inline font-style="italic">in toto,</inline> ' we should be dealing with the exchange rate by a formula which would give rise, no doubt, to criticism by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J</inline> Johnston. We should immediately bring about an increase of duties against Japan, which takes a large quantity of our wheat and wool. </para>

Are we to accept the statement that the currency of the United States of America is down, when we really know nothing about the position? When the Tariff Board made its recommendation, the United States of America and Germany were two outstanding examples of countries that would be benefited by the proposed amendment. By this bill the Government is striking a more powerfulblow for Empire economic unity than anything else that has been done since preferencewas first granted to the Motherland many years ago. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ! Driven from pillar to post for arguments in support of his amendment, the honorable senator reminds me of an Egyptologist excavating amongst ruins in search of articles of antiquity; but the honorable senator is not prepared to face the position as we find it to-day. He remarked, " The exchange rate has fallen in America". The fact that we know practically nothing about the internal position in that country to-day is one of the fundamental reasons why the department recommended that the Government should accept the board's report only so far as it referred to goods to which the British preferential rates apply. When the time comes for bargaining with other countries, we shall be able, under  this  measure, to obtain all the facts that we require. I appeal to the honorable senator to withdraw his amendment, particularly in the interests of the primary producers whom he claims to represent. Already the Government has received overtures, which I do not intend to disclose in this chamber, from foreign countries who desire closer trade relations with Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - In reply to the Minister's statement that my amendment would cut across the Ottawa agreement, I point out that any such result would have to be attributed to the Tariff Board itself. I cannot believe that this board, which has been much eulogized by members of the Government on other occasions, would have made such a mistake. In the reference made to it on the 14th December, 1932, the board was asked to inquire into the practicability of evolving some method of varying duties imposed under protective items of the customs tariff by reason of the operation of exchange and primage, having regard, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> to the necessity for maintaining the protection given to Australian industries, primary and secondary, and the margins of preference agreed to under the  United  Kingdom-Australia Trade Agreement Act 1932, and the Customs Tariff (Canadian Preference) 1931. The matter was placed before the Tariff Board, which after due consideration, made certain recommendations, to which my amendment is designed to give effect.  The  Minister's speech of a couple of years ago was consistent with the policy upon which the present Government was elected. I disclaim the Minister's suggestion that I referred to an ancient document, or attributed to him views other than those which the people of South Australia believe he still holds. The Minister cannot' evade the fact that the Tariff Board was instructed to keep the Ottawa agreement in mind in considering this matter and that, having done so, it made recommendations along the lines of my amendment. The Government professes to be guided by the Tariff Board, but it is not prepared to accept the Board's recommendation in this important matter which affects practically every item in the tariff schedule. It has definitely disregarded the board's report on this important matter. The Government's refusal to accept the board's recommendation in this instance will keep lip the cost of production in Australia, particularly in primary industries. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister did not make it clear whether, in his opinion, the present rate of exchange is natural  'Or  not. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davidson,</inline> the general manager of the Bank of New South Wales, says that it is the natural rate. In view of the Minister's statement that the idea underlying exchange is the equalization of costs between country and country, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davidson's</inline> statement means that the currency of Australia equals that of Great Britain. The great difference is that we are continuing to regard as fi both the Australian £1 and the British fi, whereas, if we called the Australian f i a " Canberra " and related it to the English £1 in the same way as we relate the English £1 to the American dollar, or the French franc, we should be on sound ground. If the exchange rate is natural there is no necessity for clause 5. That clause means that the protection afforded to Australian industries against Great Britain is to be reduced, but instead of clearly saying that it desires to give British manufacturers in Great Britain an opportunity to compete with Australian manufacturers, the Government brings forward this camouflage of exchange. I admit - as all students of economics will admit - that, for a time, one country gains an advantage when the exchange rate between it and another country is altered ; but, as time goes on, the advantage disappears. If there has been a depreciation of the currency of Australia because of inflation, and a natural exchange rate shows the true relation of the Australian currency to the British currency, it follows that Great Britain is advantaged if the tariff is reduced. The Government is under a misapprehension regarding exchange; at least the Minister in charge of the bill has not made himself clear. I should like him to say definitely whether the present rate of exchange is, or is not, natural. The Minister says that we cannot arrive at a proper conclusion in regard to exchange in relation to the United States of America because of the fluctuations of the currency of that country. We cannot get the facts in regard to foreign countries, and, therefore, Ave cannot arrive at a proper conclusion in regard to out1 currency and theirs, but, according to the Minister, we have all the facts relating to exchange as between Australia and Groat Britain. In spite of that statement, however, the Minister has not said whether the exchange rate is natural or is fixed arbitrarily. He should be able to give us that information. </para>

                        <para>- I frankly admit that Australian primary producers gained a decided advantage from the increase of the exchange. Assuming that a natural rate of exchange now exists between Australia and England, they did not receive adequate payment for the goods they sold prior to the increase. The exchange was pegged at a certain rate, with the result that money was taken from one section of the community and given to another section. </para>

                        <para>-I am endeavouring to ascertain what is a natural rate; I have admitted that the raising of the rate confers a benefit on Australian primary producers. I now am seeking the Minister's opinion as to whether £125 is the natural rate between Australia and Great Britain. If it is, we, by passing this clause, shall be doing a disservice to those industries which previously had a certain measure of protection. If the rate was natural, when the currencies of Britain and Australia were at par, and wo protected an Australian industry by a50 per cent. duty, that protection remained so long as the rate of exchange was natural. In considering the question of exchange, people are frequently misled, because they continue to regard the Australian pound as£1, instead of falling it by some other name. In France and the United States of America, there is no suggestion that legislation of this nature should be introduced. Despite the juggling of currencies, there is always a certain natural relation between francs and dollars, and between dollars and pounds; there is no camouflaging of the position by means of tariff or exchange manipulation. The Minister should state the true position of exchange as between Australia and Great Britain. If the rate is a natural one, both this clause and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston's</inline> amendment should be opposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> is a freetrader who would reduce import duties to a minimum excepting where Western Australian industries are concerned. That State has started to grow bananas; were the rate of exchange to affect that industry adversely, the honorable senator would probably view the position differently. Before we can vote intelligently on the amendment, or on the clause itself, we should know whether the rate of exchange is natural or has been pegged away from the natural level. If the exchange is not a natural one, we are forced to the conclusion that the banks control the tariff policy of Australia. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> said that the Government did not interfere with the Commonwealth Bank's control of exchange, because it did not desire to exercise any political control over that institution. If the Commonwealth Bank has pegged the exchange above the natural rate, and this Parliament accepts what the bank has done, and thereby gives a greater preference to Great Britain, it follows that the Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks, with which it is closely associated, control the fiscal policy of this country. I challenge any one to point out a flaw in my argument. I am thinking particularly of the Bank of New South Wales, the general manager of which, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davidson,</inline> not only succeeded in having the exchange rate between Australia and Great Britain raised, but was also able to convert the Government of New Zealand to the policy of maintaining a highrate of exchange. </para>

                        <para>- On the contrary, the fact that we are on the 125 basis supplies the reason for the measure. I have heard many amateur economists discussing the exchange problem, and I am not surprised that the honorable senator should fall into a common error. If there were a reasonable prospect of exchange on London getting back to parity, there might not be need for this measure. The Tariff Board stated further- </para>

                    <para>For more than a year now the rate with sterling has been kept stable with 125, and the board can see no features in the present situation which are likely to influence those in control of the rate to depart in the near future from their policy of stability. The board's recommendations in respect of protective duties would, therefore, be based on false premises if it continued to accept the view that the considerable depreciation of Australian currency is a factor which may be safely ignored. </para>

                <para class="block">Many factors have to be considered in relation to exchange. First, there is the tremendously heavy interest bill which we have to meet in London every year, and in respect of which we depend entirely on our export industries. Honorable senators will have noticed that our balance in London to-day is much higher than it was at the corresponding date of last year, although our commitments have not increased to a similar extent. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable senator that a higher price for wool has been partly responsible for the larger balance in London, and that if, unhappily, present prices for wheat do not improve, the financial situation in a few months' time may not be so encouraging as it is at the moment, because, with <inline font-style="italic">si</inline> restricted harvest, we may not be able to export the quota provided under the international agreement. In this matter of exchange adjustment we should take the long view, and be guided by expert advisers such as the Commonwealth Bank, which fixes the rate of exchange, and the Tariff Board, which furnishes recommendations to the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - No honorable sena tor has, so far, expressed approval of the course taken by the Government in this matter. This appears to be a matter in which everybody is right. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> is quite consistent in submitting his requested amendment. In view of the Government's attitude generally to Tariff Board recommendations, the honorable senator is entitled to ask why, in this case, it is waiving an essential part of a recommendation by the board. I repeat that, from his point of view, his request is perfectly consistent. On the other hand, the Government is, in my opinion, right in accepting portion only of the board's recommendation. When this subject was being discussed on the second reading of the tariff, I suggested the very course, which, as it happens, the Government has followed. Honorable senators may recall that E said that the Government was now in a position to strengthen the Ottawa agreement by giving additional, preference, to Great Britain, and I hoped that it would do so. J. further said that it might be possible  also to make exceptions in the case of foreign countries with which we hai entered into special agreements. I nro glad to know that that also has been considered. Therefore, it would be illogical for me to refuse now to support a course which was first suggested by me in this chamber, although it may possibly have been- mentioned elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>- Not so far as I am aware. While I do not wish unduly to qualify my support, I cannot refrain from saying that in these matters the Government should make its own decision and not shield itself with reports of the Tariff Board. If it is proper for duties to be reduced, the Government, after considering the recommendations of the board, should scale the rates down. We are now dealing with a converse case; what are, in effect, tariff advantages to foreign nations that have been recommended by the Tariff Board have not been agreed to by the Government. I approve of the Government's decision, and my only regret is that the Ministry did not adopt at  an earlier date the commonsense attitude that it has adopted in regard to exchange and primage. I hope that this measure will result in giving further preference to Great Britain. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> desires that object to be achieved, and, in the circumstances, I crust that he will withdraw his amendment. I feel sure that the opinion of the majority of members of the committee is against him. </para>

                        <para>. - This bill provides for an amendment of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921-22, popularly known as the "anti-dumping act". The provisions of the principal act have been abused for years by the exclusion from the Australian market of British wire-netting and other goods required by primary producers. This measure has proved almost vicious means of increasing the costs to primary producers throughout the Commonwealth. It has placed an unjustifiable burden on the backs of wheat-growers, sheep-farmers and others, and I am entirely opposed to restrictive legislation of this kind. My experience in. the past four and a half years convinces me that no Minister for Trade and Customs, and no government, should be given the tariff-making power to be conferred by this bill, and particularly that given under the principal act. </para>

                            <para>- Nevertheless, I should be glad if the Government repealed the principal act, and gave the primary producers who depend on. the world's markets full opportunity to purchase their requisites in those markets. 1 emphasize this the more because the abuse of the parent act for so many years lias prevented Australian graziers and farmers from obtaining wire netting at world prices. Although the application of the anti-dumping provisions of that act to wire netting was recently repealed, the fact remains that for about a decade the primary producers have borne a grievous burden. This is the first opportunity I have had to enter my protest against the parent act.' and I gladly avail myself of it. I object to this legislation, because I would not entrust to any government or Minister the power virtually to determine the fiscal policy of this country when Parliament is iti recess. If the Government wants to alter the duties on goods entering this country, it should call Parliament together for the purpose; otherwise it should allow the existing duties to remain until Parliament meets in the ordinary course. I object to any government or Minister having the power to alter and increase tariff items at will, or to impose grievous burdens on that section of the community which is least able to bear them. I refer to the primary producers. I do not believe in double-edged legislation of this nature, which is always used to injure the primary producer. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston's</inline> arguments are the most one-sided I have ever heard in this chamber. Listening to him, a stranger would be justified in believing that other honorable senators desire only to take from the primary producer, and to give to him nothing in return. What would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> say if Parliament decided to bring to Australia a boatload of beer from Germany? The honorable senator cannot have it both ways. If there should be freetrade in those things which the primary producers buy, then why not have freetrade in wheat? We could get wheat from Russia for ls. a bushel. If we are to wipe out the protective barriers in some cases, let us be consistent and wipe them out. altogether. I hope that the committee will take a more broadminded view of these things than that put before it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> If we carry the honorable senator's arguments to their logical conclusion. we shall have to agree that the dairy farmer has no right to a protection valued at £4,000,000 a year, or the fruit-grower to a protection of £3,000,000 a year. Nor, in that case, would there be anY reason why we should agree to the people of Australia paying £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 a year in exchange. Each year about £15,000,000 is taken from the pockets of the general community and given to the primary producers. </para>

He would allow any nation to dump its goods into this country so long as the primary producer could get them cheaply. I remind the honorable senator that there is no duty on wire netting from Great Britain. This Parliament is doing what it can to assist the primary producers of Australia. I do not say that they are not worthy of assistance; but I do say that, if they are to be protected, other sections of the community also should be protected. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> is most inconsistent. He overlooks the fact that the primary producers of Australia are generously protected. Of what use would it be to protect the farmers of Australia if other sections of the community were left without the wherewithal to purchase their products? I do not want to see goods from other countries dumped into Australia. </para>

            <para>A circular which has been distributed on behalf of the Bureau of Publicity of the Australian Country Party declares that " recent events have shown that our unjust discrimination against certain Japanese goods endangers the retention of our best wool ' customer ". It adds that " for the sake of penalizing £2,000,000 of Japanese merchandise, our tariff jeopardizes the purchase by Japan of £0,400,000 worth of our wool, and £2,200,000 worth of our wheat, together with other goods, which brings the total purchase of Australian goods by Japan to £9,500,000". </para>
            <para>There are many features of the Australian tariff, particularly in respect to the retaliation which it evokes, that are open to the most serious objection, but such fiscal measures in respect of Japan that might come within the scope of such retaliation are in an entirely different category. </para>
            <para>Japan has obviously set about a definite task of undermining the textile industries of the British Empire. In her campaign, she has the assistance of a negligible " standard " of living, low wages, &amp;c. </para>
            <para>She is buying Australian wool, and she will continue to buy it, for without it she cannot hope to compete with the established textile industries of the world. If, however, she succeeds in winning domination of the textile industry, and thus gains a position from which she can dictate the price of wool, the present high levels will not continue to rule. The Country party will not gain prestige by following this line of attack. </para>
            <para>I should like \o ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> whether he is British or Japanese in  his  outlook. He cannot have it both  ways.  When he goes back to Western Australia he may find it necessary to explain to  the  Empire League there just  where he  stands. </para>

                <para>I read in a newspaper to-day of  an  interview which a newly arrived Japanese commercial representative gave to press reporters in Sydney. He said that he was sorry to hear of the attacks made by Australian politicians and business men on the commercial activities of Japan. Japanese industry, he said, was highly mechanized, as was that of the United States of America. If the policy of which he complained were continued, Japan would have to look elsewhere for the wool it was now buying in Australia, and he mentioned South Africa and the Argentine as possible sources of supplies. Of course, we know that modern commercialism knows no frontiers, and is prepared to buy in Germany, France, Austria, South  Africa,  the Argentine or anywhere else if it can get what it wants at a suitable price. Japan is buying Australian wool because it suits it to do so. </para>
                <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Australasian Manufacturer,</inline> in its issue of 6th May, 1933, published a subleader from which I quote the following extracts : -  "Once more unto the breach, dear friends," - the breach of the Ottawa agreement, committed by the British Government, first, in taking wheat from Russia when there was ample wheat to be taken from the dominions; second, in taking meat from the Argentine, when all its requirements could have been taken from Australia; third, in giving an order for £7,000,000 worth of butter to Denmark, when this country could have supplied the lot. The Russian wheat was cheaper than Australian wheat - but what about " the spirit of the Ottawa agreement"? British financiers have millions invested in the Argentine - but what about "a self-contained Empire?". Denmark trades with England - but in proportion to Australia's trade with England, Denmark's total is paltry. </para>
                <para class="block">That reference to a self-contained Empire reminds me that, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> was twitted with being a rebel because of his secessionist activities in Western Australia, he said that he and his colleagues always opened their meetings with the singing of God Save the Kang, and closed them in the same way. Apparently his idea was that if. any present had forgotten to save the King at the beginning of the meeting, they might have an opportunity of doing so at the end. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> who claims to be a good Australian and a good Britisher, and who is a member of a dozen or so patriotic organizations in Western Australia, has now declared that he is prepared to allow the goods of all nations to be dumped in Australia, no matter what the effect upon Australian industry. </para>

A little while ago the association which guards the interests of Australian manufacturers issued the following circular :  - " Steady, continuous effort is essential to build up sufficient funds to fight the manufacturers' battles. You will remember that the fighting fund was introduced to enable manufacturers to contribute on a pro rata basis of Hd. per employee per week, paid quarterly, as it was felt that few firms found it convenient to. pay a lump sum when the money was most needed.

                <para>April, published a scathing loading article on the Trade Treaty with Denmark. Here are a few sentences : - " It would certainly seem to most observers on this side of the world that something is radically wrong with Empire statesmanship." "... to give away £7,000,000 to Denmark, as the latest treaty does . . . strains the spirit of the agreement, however  closely  it mav conform to the letter." </para>
                <para>A few months ago when the Government of Great Britain introduced measures for the protection of British farmers, the Danish Government depreciated its currency to such an extent, that Danish cream was sent to London and, within two miles of Buckingham Palace, was manufactured into Danish butter for consumption by the people of Britain, to the detriment of the British dairying industry.

                    <para>In Canberra last week, during the tariff debate, the freetrade warhorse from Western Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> moved an amendment to one item that would have allowed an 80 per cent, impost on British cotton piece goods. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gregory,</inline> the Ottawa agreement provided that no duty higher than 75 pur cent, was to be im.posed upon British goods. The amendment was defeated. By voting against thu amendment,  the Lyons Government itself has admitted that the Ottawa agreement is impracticable. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> took the opportunity to tell the House again that the agreement  was unworkable, and that before long, " it would only be a scrap of paper." </para>
                    <para>So far as English statesmanship is concerned, the agreement is already a scrap of paper. So far as English industry is  com cerned,  every advantage has been taken to use the agreement as an instrument to injure Australian manufactures. The latest example of that is to be seen in the woollen goods that will now come from England in ever increasing quantities. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton</inline> told the House during the tariff debate last week, many Australians arc under the impression that all the woollen goods imported from England are made from Australian wool. That was not so. Many of the woollen goods coming here were made from raw material from the Argentine mid other countries. He expressed the hope that if the Australian woollen industry fell into danger in the future, the Minister himself would  act promptly, and not adopt the slow process of going to the Tariff Board. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton</inline> might have saved his breath. The Lyons Government, while it remains in power, will do nothing likely to annoy its overseas friends. Even if the reduction of the duties on knitted or lock-stitched piece goods eventually closes mills in such districts as Bendigo. Ballarat and Geelong,  the conscience of the Lyons Government will be clear. It will have observed the spirit and letter of the -agreement, wherever the spirit and letter operate in favour of overseas interests. </para>
                    <para>The only hope for the complete destruction of the infamous agreement in the near future seems to exist in its own impracticability. When the pretence that it is workable can no longer be sustained, the Government may have the grace to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin,</inline> that it is but " a scrap of paper ". It will then he put in its proper place - with other scraps of paper. </para>

                    (Queensland) [5.55J. - I draw the attention of the Minister to a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline>
                    in the House of Representatives which indicated that in the operation of the formula for which this measure provides, Australian industries will suffer, in that the protectionafforded them will not be so great as that given prior to the depreciation of Japanese currency.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin,</inline>
                    by way of illustration, took the value of certain goods at £2,100, and pointed out that a 60 per cent, duty upon them -would increase the cost to £3,360. If there were a currency depreciation of 40 per cent., the actual cost of the goods plus duty would be only £2,220, a difference of £1,140. According to the right honorable gentleman's statement, however, .the formula to be applied would give an added value of only £4S0. I shall be grateful if the Minister will elucidate this point. It has been said that the Japanese Government has deliberately depreciated the currency of Japan; but that statement has been denied by certain Japanese Ministers, who declare that the yen has not been depreciated  to any greater extent than has arisen from ordinary causes. Of course, our currency has been depreciated, because of the inflation following upon war finance; but gold is still accepted as the basis of currency values.

                    <para>- Gold is the most stable commodity that I know of, and throughout the world it has played an important part under the capitalistic system, in providing a standard of real value. If I sell an ounce of gold in Great Britain, and <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> receiving payment in .English paper pounds, transfer the money to Australia, I get a larger sum in Australian currency, because £100 sterling is worth £125 in this country. Paper pounds are thus still related to gold values. According to some authorities, currencies have been deliberately depreciated in various parts of the world. The depreciation of the dollar and the yen has enabled the United Stated of America and Japan to compete more easily in the export markets of the world ; but the  importers of  goods have had to pay increased prices for them. In Australia the workers have been penalized, because the manipulation of the currency has increased their cost of living. By comparison with the employees, the manufacturers have gained, because wages have not risen in proportion to the depreciation of the Australian pound. The Government declares that whether or not the depreciation of currency has been deliberately brought about, Australia has been affected by it, mid <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> has taken action in accordance with the Tariff Board's recommendations. </para>

                    <para>. - No new principle is involved in this legislation, for since 1921, when Australia was troubled because of the depreciation of the German mark, the Italian lira and the currency of other continental countries, this principle has been embodied in Commonwealth legislation. Section 8 of the act which we now seek to repeal contains a special provision to deal with depreciated currencies. The schedule to the 1921 act had specific application; its tables do not apply to the present case. For instance, one table applied to the German mark, another to the  French  and Belgian franc, and others to other countries. Elaborate tables were provided to deal more or less accurately with the difficulties then presented by the currencies of specified countries; now  the  TarifF Board has evolved a formula for general application. </para>

                        <para>- Section 4 of the Industries Preservation Act of 1921 deals with goods which are invoiced for export to this country at prices below (heir domestic prices in the country of origin. If we are to allow war u&gt; be made on our industries in that fashion, we may as well do so by means of a depreciated currency. Rather than send goods to Australia, at prices below the domestic prices in their own countries, some nations resort to the device of depreciating their own currencies, thereby enabling their merchants to get their goods into Australia at rates against which Australian industries cannot compete. Section 4 of the Industries Preservation Act applies only when the domestic price in the country of origin is higher than the invoice price of the goods sent to Australia. The Tariff Board supplied a formula, and. the Government has applied it so as to give as little offence as possible to nations which are good customers of Australia. Nothing offensive to any nation is intended in this legislation ; we merely say that Ave intend to protect Australian industries from competition of a certain character. </para>

Parliament can soon put things right. It would he cumbersome, and, in some cases, disastrous, to have to wait for legislation to he passed by Parliament. Already certain industries in Great Britain have complained of the absence of legislation for their protection. </para>

                    <para>. -  Apparently, we must support this amendment, because if we reject it section 8 of the principal act will remain operative. It is the principal act that is defective, and this proposed amendment slightly improves it. I have said before, and I still maintain that, in spite of the opinion held by the High Court of Australia, the bill confers upon the Minister for Trade and Customs a power which the Constitution never intended that he should possess. The first section of the Constitution lays down what shall constitute the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, and how it shall exercise its power. Section 90 provides that the Parliament shall have paramount and exclusive power to impose uniform duties of customs and excise. The Constitution does not provide that Parliament shall have the authority to delegate its power to any other authority. Although I recognize the futility of offering any opposition to this proposed amendment, I register my protest against what I consider the usurpation of the powers of this Parliament. We have heard numerous protests against Parliament handing over to the Tariff Board the power of making customs tariffs, but however extensive may be the powers of that body, it has the authority only to recommend that certain things shall be done. The Tariff Board does not attempt to exercise any power other than recommending to the Government a cer-  tain course, in support of which it adduces reasons. Under section 8, and also under the proposed new section, however, the Minister for Trade and Customs can snap his fingers at this Parliament, and decide whether duties shall or shall not be imposed. That has happened more than once in the history of th6 Commonwealth by reason of the powers conferred upon the Minister by the principal act. In spite of the judgment delivered by the High Court, I protest against this provision. I think it wrong for the Parliament to be hamstrung in this way. It is giving to an individual the power to make the laws of this country. </para>

                        <para>- It is dangerous to assert and difficult to prove a negative; but, speaking impromptu, I do not think that the section which this provision is to replace has ever been dealt with by the High Court. In the original Customs Act there is a provision under which the Governor-General in Council is given power to prohibit imports by proclamation. Although it was argued that that was a usurpation by the Minister of power which was vested exclusively in Parliament, the High Court held that Parliament could delegate its powers to the Governor-General in Council. Any criticism of what has been done under section 8 applies with greater force to a provision such as is now proposed. The proposed new section merely means that if the Minister is satisfied after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board about certain exchange values and currency, he can alter the duties. That does appear to place very great power in the hands of the Minister, but, as pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll,</inline> no advantage would be gained by negativing this clause as that would throw us back on the provision that has been in operation for many years, and which, if anything, is worse than this. This is an illustration of the growing tendency of Parliament to delegate its authority by extending the regulation-making power of different bodies, but even in the case of regulations, often as they are abused, the right of veto rests with either House of Parliament. The trouble in this instance is that there is no right of veto. The Minister has to be satisfied after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, which means that he has to say that he is satisfied. The court has held times out of number that if the Minister says he is satisfied no one can cross-examine him as to why he is satisfied. There is no limitation or requirement laid down as to what form the preliminary inquiry shall take, or what shall be the nature of the Tariff Board's report. In effect, the Minister can provide for new customs duties, and when he has given his decision neither House of Parliament can call it into question. Of course, the House of Representatives can always dismiss a Ministry, and, therefore, the Ministry cannot fly in the face of the majority in the other chamber. Although the Senate has co-equal rights with the other chamber in the making of laws, it will have no power whatever to call in question anything done under this proposed new section. This is a further illustration of the powers given to the Governor-General in Council to legislate by proclamation - n. power, which I venture to say, was abused very noticeably recently when after this Parliament had imposed a duty on sheet glass, the Governor-General in Council by proclamation prohibited the importation of that commodity. This is an instance of Parliament handing over its powers to departmental officers. When we speak of the Minister we really mean the departmental officers who have charge of this branch df the Trade and Customs Department. They are the persons who make recommendations to the Minister. Naturally, hq trusts his officers, but by this system we are getting further from the exclusive right of Parliament to make laws for the good government of the country. </para>

                    thinks the bill is unconstitutional, he has the right to challenge it before the proper tribunal, but this is not the place in which to do so. If the recommendations of the Tariff Board had been adopted in their entirety, the system provided for in the bill would have operated automatically in respect of those countries whose currencies are depreciated. We have merely adopted the  principle embodied in the existing section 8, and made it applicable, with certain modifications, to the present situation. The act dealt, specifically with the depreciated lira, mark and franc, and the principle reappears in the present measure in a form which is not, so likely to give offence to friendly countries, but will, at the same time, protect Australia's industries. The Tariff Board, on page 9 of its report, states -

                    said that the bill represented a further invasion by the Executive of the legislative powers of Parliament. If that be so, the wrong has existed ever since  1922.  The original act was passed for the specific purpose of meeting an exigency which first arose then, but which now exists in a more intensified form. The provision now proposed is more elastic than the existing section  8.  The honorable senator said that no limitation has been placed on the power of the Minister, but I remind him that, before action can be taken, there must be an inquiry by the Tariff Board, and the board must report that the exchange value of the currency of the country of origin of the goods has depreciated in relation to Australian currency, and that, by reason of such depreciation, goods have been, or are being, sold to importers in Australia at a price which is detrimental to an Australian industry. The Executive is responsible to Parliament, which always has the right to override anything the Executive does. It has been objected that the rights of the Senate are being ignored, but I remind honorable senators that at times it is necessary to take prompt action to protect Australian industry. If other nations make war on. our trade by depreciating their currencies, 'we must do what is necessary to defend ourselves.

                    <para>.- When, this bill was first introduced, I saw no particular objection to it. I take it that there is general agreement among honorable senators that the purpose of the bill is good, and that the bill itself is a necessary complement to the one we have already passed. I agree, however, after hearing the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> that the Senate would bc unwise willingly to deprive itself of the power to review decisions of the Minister for Trade and Customs. The House of Representatives has always had power to review the decisions of Ministers, but, as we were reminded not very long ago, the Senate does not possess such power. Most of us have had reason to complain that the tariff has not been submitted to the Senate for approval, sometimes for as long as two or three years after its introduction. Is it wise, therefore, for the Senate, by its own act, to surrender its right to review ministerial decisions? I do not think that it is. I do not say that the Minister would ever exercise his power other than as he thought best, but the Senate should retain the right to say whether, in its opinion, the Minister has decided rightly. The Minister's determinationshould be laid on the table of the Senate so that it may be discussed and, if necessary, overruled. There is at present on the notice-paper a bill dealing with the payment of a bounty in the iron and steel industry. In that measure, Parliament is asked to surrender the power to decide what shall be done in the event of certain contingencies arising. I maintain that Parliament should not surrender that power. It may delegate its power, but it should always retain the right of review. I put forward the suggestion, placed before me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> that the Minister, instead of merely promulgating his decision by  notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> should issue regulations. These would have to be laid on the table of Parliament, and either House could disallow them. If the Minister will give an assurance that such regulations will be issued, I shall be content; otherwise, I propose to move an amendment that any action taken under the bill shall be subject to the approval of both Houses of Parliament, such approval to be expressed within six months of the publication of the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice. This will make it abundantly clear that the Senate, while prepared for the sake of convenience to grant certain powers to the Minister, retains control over him by requiring him to submit his decisions to Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - The provision to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> now objects has been in the act since 1922. All that we are doing now is to remodel it by substituting a formula for the schedule to the old act. In practically every other respect the proposed new section is a reproduction of section 8. Parliament has considered this matter from time to time, and has re-affirmed its decision with regard to it. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> that the constitutional rights of the respective Houses of Parliament are involved in his amendment, which the Government cannotaccept. Clearly his intention is to make the Senate superior to the House of Representatives. What would happen in the event of the Senate declaring its opposition to a certain rate of duty, and the Government insisting on its original proposal? This chamber cannot arrogate to itself the right to control the actions of Cabinet Ministers. This matter was debated at some length in the other chamber upon a similar amendment. Those in control of industrial concerns are entitled to know where they stand and what is the Government's attitude. Obviously we could not allow action under the proposed new section to be altered at the whim of either House, and thus extend to the Senate control over the Government of the day in respect of tariff matters. In its present form the proposed section will not be offensive to the countries that are likely to be affected by it, because we are not picking out any particular country or industry, and we do not want to cause conflict between the two branches of the legislature. </para>

                <para class="block">The Minister has said that the present procedure has been followed for a number of years. That, I suggest, is the very reason why it is necessary to alter it. It is not becoming a Senate Minister to approve of any proposal to whittle away the powers of the Senate in deference to the powers of another place. The Senate's powers are clearly defined in the Constitution, and the Minister should at all times uphold them. It is. within the knowledge of most honorable senators that whether intentionally or otherwise, the Senate has been largely debarred from exercising powers conferred on it by the Constitution with regard to tariff matters. That fact, I repeat, is the chief reason why we should endeavour to alter the procedure. The Minister also said that it would be improper for the Senate, by resolution, to override regulations approved by the House of Representatives. In the last Parliament the Senate repeatedly disallowed regulations, approved by the House of Representatives, dealing with the waterside workers. </para>

                    HUGHES.Whether or not the regulations in question dealt with a financial matter is beside the point; The question at issue then was the constitutional powerof the two Houses. The very last act of the Senate in the last Parliament was to disallow a regulation, made by the Scullin Government, with the approval of the House of Representatives. I again suggest that' it is not fitting that the Vice-President of the Executive Council who, as a private senator, supported the action of the Senate in disallowing a ministerial action under one act, should now take precisely the opposite view. Personally I do not care very much if my amendment is defeated; it is so obviously equitable that any reasonable-minded man outside Parliament, reading it, would ask what' was the objection to it? What objection can there be to Parliament exercising a final decision in respect of a ministerial action based on a recommendation by an extra parliamentary body without authority? My intention in moving the amendment, is to ensure that this branch of the legislature shall exercise the powers given to it under the Constitution.

The Government has not been unmindful of what happened in another place.

While I appreciate the honorable senator's pleasantries as to what I should do as a Minister, I shall always be guided by what I conceive to be the underlying principles of the Constitution, whether I happen to be a member of this or the other branch of the legislature.

                <para class="block">Section 53 of the Constitution, with which honorable senators are familiar, provides that proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate, and in respect of such proposed laws the Senate mar' only make requests for amendments. Section 57 states that if the House of Representatives passes any proposed law, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, and if, after an interval of three months, the House of Representatives in the same or the next session again passes the proposed law, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, a double dissolution may take place. Does it appear proper to honorable senators that we should take away a power that was given to . the Minister eleven years ago, and which it is now proposed to grant again, with further safeguards in the interests of the people and of decent tariff policy? If the amendment were accepted, the Senate would be given a power in ' respect to taxation matters which, I venture to say, was never contemplated under the Constitution. The power previously conferred upon the Minister is of an exceptional kind, and was given- in exceptional circumstances. The Government asks that it be granted again in equally exceptional circumstances. I cannot support the amendment. </para>

I am as anxious as any other member of this committee to safeguard the powers of the Senate, and, if 1 had not looked for the motive, behind the amendment, I might have fallen into a trap and might have supported it because, allegedly, it will prevent the filching from the Senate of some of its Constitutional powers.

                    that he is prepared to allow any country to dump goods into the Commonwealth. The clause now under discussion gives the Minister power to deal with dumping immediately it becomes apparent. If the measures he adopted were subjected to disallowance by either chamber, chaos, and even the ruin of industries, might result.

                        <para>- It does not. It mainly involves the claim of this Senate that the Constitution, which provides that the legislative power of the Commonwealth shall bc vested in the Sovereign, the Senate, and the House of Representatives, shall be obeyed. In other words, before any measure becomes law in this country it shall, in accordance with the provisions appearing at the very outset of the Constitution, he approved by both Houses of Parliament. The reason for the criticism of the Government's -proposal is that it does not relate to an Administrative act, but to an act of legislation, and, most important of all, an act of taxation legislation. This act could be performed by the Governor- General-in-Counc.il, and one branch of this legislature, at any rate, would have no power to veto it. The Minister said that this provision was introduced Originally eleven years ago, at a time of stress. The implication, apparently, is that in the meantime the state of emergency passed away, hut is now presenting itself again, and that it becomes necessary to make a similar provision. If the power Conferred by section S of the Industries Preservation Act has been lying dormant for some considerable time, that is all the more reason why we should call attention, to the fact that a proposal of this kind does whittle away the rights of this chamber. The .Minister has sug gested that something turns on the fact that this is a taxation bill, and he read from the Solicitor-General part of an opinion which that gentleman gave upon a totally different matter. I should imagine that it was upon the disagreement between the two chambers which .  i3  already manifest in regard to one or two small items in a very long tariff schedule. </para>

If we can reject the customs tariff as a whole, as undoubtedly we can, surely we can reject a particular provision which the Minister proposes shall become law.If the Minister does not wish to bring this provision into force by regulation,and thinks that it can be better done- by act of Parliament, he can introduce a bill in the other chamber, and surely before it becomes law it should have the assent of both branches of the legislature. In respect of legislation by the Governor-General-]' n-Council, or anything that amounts to doing what the Constitution says Parliament shall do in exercising the legislative power, this chamber has the right to say whether it shall become the law of the land ; and a decision of the Minister, on the advice of the Tariff Board, becomes substantially the law of the land when it is notified in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline></para>

Exactly the same result as will be obtained . under this proposed section would come about if the suggestion, that the Minister should proceed by regulation were adopted.

                    <para>. - I hope that the committee will not agree to the proposed amendment which, if passed, will hamper the administration of the Customs Department. This legislation is not new, except so far as it provides for the effect of exchange on the duties to be collected. The Industries Preservation Act has been in operation for a number of years and I have never heard any complaints regarding its administration. So far as I am aware, its provisions have never been applied harshly. It would be inconsistent to provide for parliamentary review of the operation of this proposed section when there exists no power to review action taken under other sections of the principal act. For the amendment to become 1 effective Parliament would have to meet at, frequent intervals, and we should practically dispense with what is termed "responsible government. " In the peculiar circumstances of industry and trade throughout the world at the present time it  i3  necessary, for the preservation of the interests of Australian industries, that the responsible Minister should retain all the powers he now possesses, in addition to those which this bill proposes to give to him. I do not share the opinion that the position in Australia is much better than it was a few months ago. It may be that some businesses are doing better this year than they did last year, but in many instances their success has been gained at the expense of other businesses. It is imperative that every step possible shall be taken to preserve the secondary industries of this country </para>

                        <para>- In considering these things, we must he careful not to confuse cause and effect. The World Economic Conference, which met in London recently, had as its main objective a general reduction of tariffs and a removal of some of the existing barriers ito trade. That conference failed,- chiefly because so many countries had made strenuous efforts to become, self-contained, and had found the policy to be good. The last presidential election in the United States of America ,was fought largely on the fiscal policy of that country. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roosevelt</inline> promised that, if he were returned, he would set about reducing the protective duties; hut he has not attempted to reduce one of them. T have had some experience in connexion with the administration of the Trade and Customs Department, and am bound to say that the officers holding responsible positions there are men of ability and integrity. I have not come into such close contact with the junior officers of the department,  and therefore cannot speak with first-hand knowledge of them, although I have no reason to doubt their honesty or their -fitness for the positions they hold. I anl convinced that the administration of this legislation may safely he left in. the hands of the officers of the department, under the direction of the Minister for the time being. </para>

                        <para>- The Constitution is silent on the power o'f  this  Parliament to delegate to any individual the right to tax the people of Australia; yet that is what this hill empowers the Minister to do. Legislation of this kind, although in a slightly different form, has been on the statute-book for many years : but this is the first time that its constitutionality has "been questioned. There' is no suggestion that the Minister may make a wrong use of his power, or that his officers may be dishonest. </para>

Later, it was contended that a' new principle would, be embodied in our legislation if the amendment became law. The Minister might impose exchange and dumping duties on goods from countries with a currency more depreciated than our own, and then either House could by resolution disallow such duties. It was contended that Parliament was being asked to allow a customs duty to be dealt with as if it were a regulation. When a tariff schedule is tabled in the House of Representatives, the duties become operative immediately, and are not varied unless that chamber so decides. If either House had the right to disallow a dumping duty imposed by the Minister under the powers conferred upon him, importers would 'be in doubt until the period within which' the duty might he disallowed had expired. The power possessed by either branch of the legislature to disallow a regulation differs materially from that suggested in this instance. The dumping duties imposed under the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act are not subject to disallowance by either House of the Parliament, and if an  amendment on the lines suggested were adopted, commercial chaos would prevail until a definite decision had been reached. </para>

As one House of Parliament has not the right to exercise the power now sought with respect to customs duties generally, it is unreasonable to suggest that either House should have the power to disallow a dumping duty. The Minister, who is always answerable to Parliament, will naturally exercise his powers in a proper way. </para>

                    <para>.- As we all know, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(.Senator McLachlan)</inline> is an able debater, but only on one occasion have I known him to be less convincing than he has been to-night, and that was during the tariff debate on glass. I was unaware that the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> had moved a similar amendment in the House of Representatives. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll,</inline> who raised this matter, is more closely associated with the honorable member for Swan, and possibly knew what was done in the other chamber. I am glad that the point has come up for our consideration. The Minister said that if the amendment is carried, either House will have the right to disallow a proclamation issued under the authority of the Minister for Trade and Customs. That, in a sense, is true, but, putting it in another way, the effect of the provision in the bill would be to give the Executive, and not the House of Representatives, the power of making a decision, and eventually of overriding the will of Parliament as a whole. The House of Representatives would naturally be inclined to follow the lead of the Government, and would npt offer any opposition; in those circumstances the Senate's right of veto would lapse. If the Senate is to delegate certain power, it has the right to say on what terms and conditions that power shall be exercised. It is idle for the Minister to say that the Senate has no power to amend taxation measures. The Senate is at liberty to reject entirelya money bill, and, if it does so, of what avail is the limitation of its power of amendments? The Minister, in effect, says that we should not even express an opinion on the exercise of the anti-dumping provisions, because they 'relate to taxation, but I decline to accept that view. </para>

                        <para>- I have provided that approval must be given within six months, so that it will not be necessary to call Parliament together to deal with a particular situation which may arise. The amendment is a precaution against the Executive acting in contravention of the wishes of Parliament. It is possible, for instance, that a future Labour government might choose to act under this provision in a way of which the Senate disapproved, but the 'Senate would have no power of veto. It would have given a power of attorney, and would have no further say in the matter. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> began his speech by saying that he suspected it would not be long before I imputed motives. That may or may not have been a generous remark, and I am not particularly concerned over it, except to state that, in my opinion, there ought to "be a motive behind every speech that is delivered in this chamber. There is certainly a motive 'behind what I am saying now. If it is not, true, that the suggester and mover of this amendment - I understand that the responsibility is divided - were prompted by a desire to defeat the effective operation of the Industries Preservation Act, I have done them an injustice. Now, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes,</inline> of his own accord, advanced another possible motive, namely, that there might <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> in power a Labour government which would seek to administer the act too conscientiously to suit his freetrade prejudice. Perhaps neither of those suggested motives is the real one, and the amendment may have been born of its sponsor's complete ignorance of customs procedure. I cannot conceive of any one who has had personal acquaintance with the work of the Trade and Customs Department supporting an amendment of this kind. If the Industries Preservation Act is to he of any use whatever to the secondary industries of Australia, there must be power for some one to act on the instant that action becomes necessary. </para>

No one is more jealous of the rights of this chamber than I am, but those who are posing as champions of the rights of the Senate on this occasion are, at other times, prepared to forgo those rights when it suits their, political purposes. The Industries Preservation Act is a valuable instrument for the protection of Australian, industry. If this amendment is agreed to, the effectiveness of that act will he largely destroyed. 1 cannot believe that the majority of honorable senators are prepared to support so iniquitous an amendment. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of the measure is to ratify the reductions made in the ordinary customs duties in connexion with the budget. The goods covered comprise beer, spirits, tea and rubber. The importations of these commodities during the year 1 931-32 totalled £1,845,000, of which over £1,000,000 worth was purchased from British countries. The remission of taxes by way of customs and excise is estimated at £1,760,000, of which' approximately £450,000 -would be represented by the proposals contained in this bill. Tea,which will involve £185,000, and rubber, upon which £225,000 will be remitted, are the two principal items. It is expected that the public will derive the full benefit from these reductions. Some prices have already been reduced and the price aspect will be carefully watched by the department with the object of obtaining the maximum possible reduction. This bill is part of the legislation necessary to give effect to the remission of taxes provided for in the budget. </para>

                        (South Aus bill were fully discussed and, in the main, approved in the budget debate, there is little that I need say with respect this measure. The Minister observedthat the benefit from the reduction of duties on the items mentioned would be passed on to the people, and that, if they were not, the Government would take the necessary action. One of the most important items is tea, the duty on which has been reduced by1d. per lb. In connexion with this item I have a distinct recollection of a statement made by tea merchants in South Australia, when the Government's proposals were announced, that they would not be able to reduce prices. Has that statement been brought under the notice of the Government, and has the Minister for Trade and Customs investigated the position with a view to taking appropriate action should the benefit not be passed on to consumers of tea?

                        <para>- It is extraordinary that the discovery of the existence of a tea. pool synchronized with the Government's announcement of a reduction of the duty on tea. In the circumstances we should know definitely whether the Government has the power to force traders to pass on to the people the whole of the benefit following the reduction of the duty, and that, if this is not done, it will exercise its powersto the fullest extent. </para>

                        <para>. - I am in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran.</inline> The people of Australia were greatly relieved when they read of the Government's proposals to remit taxation, which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> assured us would be passed on to the people generally. Since then public announcements have been made that, in respect of several items, the public would benefit from the relief given. The duty on crude rubber has been reduced from4d. to 2d. per lb., with a view to giving relief to motorists and other purchasers of manufactures of rubber. Two or three days after, the delivery of the budget, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> A. Watt, the  chairman  of directors of the Dunlop-Perdriau Company, which, controls a very large proportion of the rubber goods manufactured in Australia, pointed out that, as the price of tyres had already been reduced considerably^ his company would not be aMe to give further relief to users. I am sure it is not the wish of the Government to make a gift of £225,000 to the rubber companies. The intention was to give relief to motorists and others who have to use rubber manufactures. The Government could effectively counter the statement made by the influential  chairman  of directors of the DunlopPerdriau Company by announcing that, if the benefit of the lower duties were not passed on to the people, it would reduce the duty on imported tyres by an amount equivalent to a duty of 2d. per lb. on rubber. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator's suggestion is a very practical one. I am prepared to support the reductions of duties in any part of the tariff schedules as they stand to-day, because of their harassing effect upon, not only the primary producers, but the people generally. I do not intend to allow the rubber companies to retain for themselves this handsome gift of £225,000 'if I can prevent it. If the Government adopts my suggestion,' and reduces the rate of duty on tyres and manufactures of rubber, it will very quickly bring them to heel, and force them to pass on the relief given by the reduction of the duties. I protest against the arrogant attitude of the principal company, and will do all in my power to see that the people benefit from these remissions of taxes. </para>

It was stated that the liquor interests had decided to put an extra ounce of beer in the mugs in. which it was supplied in hotel bars, but what means have the hundreds of thousands of consumers of measuring the mugs to be sure that the benefit of the tax remission to the brewers has been passed on to them? </para>

                    <para>Another racket is being " put over " the consumers of tea. ' Both the Lyons and Scullin Governments received revenue to the amount of £500,000 by means of the tax on tea, which was sponsored by the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> yet the tea merchants have not passed on to the consumers any of the benefit of the recent remission of the tax. They contend that when the reduction was made they were contemplating an increase of the retail price of tea.. The Government should use its influence with the. merchants to induce them to lower the price to the public. Australians are among the greatest tea drinkers in the world, and the Government ought to tell the merchants plainly that the interests of the people must be considered. </para>

                        criticism regarding the rubber duties also was justified. The rubber racketeers are led by William Watt, ex-Premier  of Victoria and ex-Federal Treasurer. He is  chairman  of directors of a combine operating from Melbourne, and finds it more profitable to be on the box seat of the rubber racketeers than on the box seat in this Parliament. -Speaking on behalf of the rubber combine,

                        stated that the time was not opportune to pass on to the people the recent remission of duty. I point out to the Government that the interests of the rubber combine should be made subservient to those of the 6,500,000 people in Australia. The Government should be strong enough to let
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline>
                        and the whole gang of racketeers - hoth the rubber trust and the beer combine - know that the people of this country who contribute to the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth should benefit by the recent remissions of taxes.

                    <para class="block">The last-mentioned schedule deals principally with reductions of duties on ales, spirits and beverages. A few days ago I voiced my decided objection to a reduction of the duties on alcoholic liquors as the effect would be to increase the consumption of such liquors.I go further, and say that I will do all within my power to bring about a diminution of their use. In order to test the committee, I move - </para>

                    <para class="block">Recently I have received numbers of letters and petitions from influential sections of the community, including the Women's Christian Temperance Onion, al most important organization whose members are actuated by the highest motives; and organizations of men connected with temperance and other societies, urging the strongest opposition to any reduction of the duties on alcoholic liquors. With them, I look forward to the day when the representatives of the people will realize that the smaller the consumption of alcoholic liquors in any country, the better for that country. The moneyspent on drink could be put to much better use, in which case a great deal of distress and unnecessary expense on the part of governments would be avoided. Every year, governments throughout the world are put to heavy expense in maintaining institutions that care for victims of the liquor traffic. In the best interests of the community generally I trust that the committee will support my amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I did not reply to all the points raised during the second-reading debate, because I thought that it would be better to do so when the individual items were reached in committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> asked whether the Government had the power to deal with those recalcitrant people who failed to pass on to consumers the benefits derived from the remissions of duties. Some traders have passed on these benefits; others have not. It would be improper for me to say more than that the Government has not only the power to deal with such persons, hut also the will to do so. The persons whom the Government considers have not passed on the remissions have been communicated with. They will, of course, bc given an opportunity lo he heard in their own defence; but I assure the committee that the Government will not hesitate to take whatever action it deems desirable or necessary. </para>
