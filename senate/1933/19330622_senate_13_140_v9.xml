                        <para>. -There is little  information  available in regard to this sub-item, upon which there is is no report from the Tariff Board. The present rates are those which were embodied in the 1921-30 schedule. The importations of carbon bisulphide in recent years have  been  infinitesimal, being nil in 1930-31, and 36 lb., valued at £4, in 1931-32. I have had the history of the position examined. It appears that the  Interstate  Commission went into the subject, and, after dealing with the methods of preparation, reported that Cuming, Smith and Company, of Melbourne, had furnished a report to the Minister to the effect that for several years it had been making carbon bisulphide, but because of the importations of the product from foreign countries at low prices it had not been able to secure sufficient of the local trade to permit it to continue  manufacturing the commodity. The firm asked for adequate protection in order that it might extend its operations and cater for the home market. Apparently, carbon bisulphide was admitted until 1914 free, and was later placed upon the tariff schedule at the present rates, since when the subject has not been investigated by the Tariff Board. I understand that our requirements are met from local sources, and that the Australian price is slightly higher than that charged in Great Britain. Our only comparison is with quotations in British trade journals, as we do not import the commodity at present. Carbon bisulphide is used for solvents, varnish, in the manufacture of matches, preservatives, insecticides, for the extermination of the sugar cane grub, and for the manufacture of carbon tetrachloride. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> pointed out that it was also used for rabbit poisoning, but I believe that it has since fallen from favour for that purpose. The price in Australia for a five-gallon drum is £53 16s.8d., the price in Great Britain for a similar quantity on the same date being £30 10s., without the drum. A number of quotations are given for smaller quantities, but the major sales of the commodity are to merchants and storekeepers. Our importations from Great Britain in 1928-29 amounted to 420 lb., and in 1929-30 to 1,120 lb., valued at £21. There have also been importations from the United States of America, Western Australia, apparently, having taken most of the carbon bisulphide which came from that quarter in 1928-29. I suggest that the duty should remain as it is. The matter, which is not an urgent one, will come before the Tariff Board for consideration. </para>

                        <para>. -  In the main, when discussing this . schedule we have approached it rather from the angle of the particular primary industry which was concerned, because of the help given to the secondary industries. This sub-item concerns all consumers, and particularly their children, who, in the aggregate, area large class. Some years ago I spoke in another place on the subject of the duty on toys, and I desire to be more or less consistent on the subject. Toys are made at their very best in Germany, from which source they appear to be excluded by what amounts to a duty of approximately  100  per cent. Excellent toys are also made in Great Britain, but I notice that our importations from that source are shrinking under the effect of our tariff, which is practically doubled by the existing rate of exchange and other charges. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so, but it raises the problem to which I have already referred : is it justifiable, particularly where the general consumers, and children as a large class are concerned, that we should exclude overseas competition or increase the cost of toys with a duty of about  70  per cent. against Great Britain, and  100.  per cent. against the rest of the world? </para>

                    <para>I realize that there is little chance of persuading the committee to think as  1  do on the subject. As it was prepared to tax perambulators, which are not luxuries in the sense that toys are, and also medicines for sick persons, it can hardly be expected to give way in the matter of toys. There is an interesting, but minor, fact appearing out of the figures that are quoted in this bulletin. I notice that during the years  1930-31  and  1931-32,  there has been a shrinkage in the importation of toys to New South Wales and Victoria to not quite one-third ; in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia to about a quarter, and in Tasmania to approximately one-seventh. The only part of the Commonwealth in which these imports have increased is the Northern Territory, where there has been an improvement from  £1  to  £2,  which cannot be regarded as having any significance. The point I make is that New South Wales and Victoria, the States which are benefiting principally by our high tariffs, are States sufficiently well off to buy these goods from overseas in larger quantities than can be done by other States. It would appear that the secondary-producing States are more prosperous than are the primary producing States, and are therefore in a position, if need be, to buy theproducts of secondary industries from overseas. I suggest to the committee, with due diffidence, that it is not a fair and reasonable thing to tax the children of Australia to the extent of  70  per cent. on the British toys they use, and to the extent of 100 per cent. on toys from other countries, in order to promote the interests of the local toy-manufacturing industry. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with the facts as they exist now. Exchange was a factor twelve months ago, and an even greater one two years ago. It is possible that in another twelve months it may still be an important consideration. We must deal with the situation as we find it now. It is not fair in these times of depression to deprive a great number of children of their toys by imposing an excessively high duty. I do not say that we should not have some protection for the local manufacturers, but protection amounting to 70 per cent. against British toys is unreasonable. </para>

                        <para>- The sob story told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> shows clearly to what lengths members of the Country party are prepared to go in regard to the tariff. I did not think that they would have attacked the duties on this item. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> must be well aware of the intense competition in the toymaking industry offered by such countries as Germany and Japan. The honorable senator's tearful story of Australian children being penalized by these duties does not cut much ice with those of us on this side of the chamber. I remind him that the toy-makers have children also; but, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes,</inline> they, apparently, do not count. </para>

They showed me wholesale price lists, and the prices at which the toys were sold by the various retail firms  in  Brisbane, proving that their pricescompared favorably with those at which the imported toys were sold. Moreover, the men employed in the factory were being paid the Australian rates of wages. Many returned soldiers are engaged in making  toys.  We  told  those men that the country would stand by  them,  and we should be prepared to assist  this  industry in  order  to keep our promise. It is  better  that our returned soldiers should  find  employment in making  toys  than that we should  open  the flood gates to unlimited quantities of  toys from  Japan, Germany and other  Countries.  I understand that the inmates of a number of deaf and  dumb  institutions are also engaged in making  toys.I  see no reason why the  duty  should be reduced. </para>

                        <para>.- For the year 1930-31  toys  to the value of £49,000 were imported  from  Great Britain, but in the same year £68,000 worth were imported  from  Germany, £29,000 worth  from  Japan, and £11,000 worth  from  other countries. The total value of the importation was £158,466. During the following year the value of these imports fell considerably, and not altogether, I think, because of the duty. The Government regards this duty, to some extent, as a tax on' luxuries, though, incidentally, it encourages a local industry. For the year 1931-32 import's fell to £59,000, partly because the people were not able to afford to buy so many toys, and partly because, owing to the depression, many persons, particularly returned soldiers suffering from war injuries, began making toys in order to support themselves. The returned soldiers organized themselves into groups, and are now producing a considerable quantity of toys, which are replacing, in the main, the high grade toys formerly imported from Germany. The Government admits that the present duty is somewhat high, and has, therefore, referred the subject to the Tariff Board for consideration and report. No Tariff Board report later than 1925 is available. </para>

                        <para>. -  I was momentarily stunned by the tearful eloquence of my dear friend in opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes,</inline> when he wept over the sorrows of the poor little children who would be deprived of their toys because of the high duty imposed on them by the Government. I ask him, as one returned soldier to another, to accompany me to the workshops in Sydney, where some of those poor, unfortunate creatures, who at one time formed the flower of. the Australian Imperial Force, are now eking out a living in manufacturing toys for Australian children. I could not help 'thinking, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> was speaking, that he was concerned, not so much with the children who might not be able to afford to buy Australian toys, as of some friends of his who are, perhaps, engaged in the importation of toys from overseas. I was moved to the verge of  tear3  by his eloquence, and might have wept outright had I not remembered, that, not so long ago, hundreds o"f tons of toys in sections used to be sent from Germany to England, where they were assembled, given a coat of paint, marked " Made in England ", and sent out here as British toys, to be admitted under the British preferential rate. This was revealed in a series of articles published in <inline font-style="italic">Smith's Weekly.</inline> Surely the honorable senator does not suggest that the returned soldiers who are trying to earn a fewshillings by making toys in Australia, should be deprived of their livelihood. It is well known that Johnny Hines, of Leichhardt, Sydney, one of whose subsidiary enterprises is the making of Cyclops toys, has always been a good United Australia party supporter. He regularly weighs in with his subscription to the United Australia party, and thus assists in the fight against the Labour party. Perhaps some of his money helped to elect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> to this Senate. I appeal to the honorable senator not to insist upon any request for a reduction of this duty. -For my pan, I -should not allow one toy to enter Australia, from abroad, because the facilities are here for the manufacture of all the toys we need for our own children. </para>

                        <para>. -  This matter is of greater importance than appears on the surface. I was surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> and the Minister in charge of the bill suggest that toys were more or less luxury goods. I dislike the application of that term to toys very much, because I believe that our children should be al1 owed' to lead the normal lives of children to an even greater extent than present conditions permit, and toys should enter largely into a child's life. I regret that we fix the school-leaving age at 14 years. Children should, in a way, be still playing with their toys even at that age, instead of being forced into the industrial field to augment the earnings of their parents. In view of the impossibility of our getting the duty on toys increased, let us, at any rate, resist any proposal for reduction. I have some knowledge of the shocking conditions prevailing in the slums in the United Kingdom where toys are made, and in Germany the conditions of the toy-makers and their families are very little better. I object to the importation into Australia of foreign goods that are produced by sweated labour. I presume that honorable senators have "taken some trouble to inform themselves of the extent to which toys are now being made in Australia, under the protection of the tariff. In Queensland, a factory is producing these goods under ideal labour conditions, and at satisfactory prices. I well remember the perfervid patriots who stumped this country during the frenzied period of the war, and said that they would " never again take the bloody hand of Germany"; but certain honorable senators are now prepared to whittle away the tariff, so that German goods may be imported to the detriment of Australian workers. I do not endorse the sentiment that we should regard everything made i n Germany as anathema ; but we should be consistent in our attitude. All the toys required in this country can be made here satisfactorily, and at reasonable prices. </para>

                            <para>- Clockwork toys are being made in Australia, but simpler toys are much preferable, because they last longer. The so-called mechanical toys are nocredit to the mechanics who make them, for they generally get out of order after 24 hours' use. Apart from returned soldiers getting a living by the manufacture of toys, the inmates of institutions for the blind, deaf, and dumb are applying themselves to this industry. In Queensland, theRed Cross Society is encouraging this, activity, and good work is being done by a factory in Brisbane. </para>

                        <para>.- I am glad that I have drawn such a friendly speech from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn;</inline> but he suggested that I had been prompted in my remarks by importers of toys. That is not so, for, so far as I remember, I have received no letter since this Parliament began, from any importer or manuf acturer of toys. I have expressed my own views; and they are the same as those stated by me nearly ten years ago. I cannot quite understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings'</inline> line of reasoning. He says that toys are not luxuries, but essentials, and as he cannot obtain higher duties on them, he hopes that the Government will adhere to the present high rates.  His  argument does not seem to be particularly logical. I am glad to hear from the Minister that this matter has been referred to the Tariff Board, and I am content, for the moment, to have ventilated it in the interests of a large section of the community. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> that before reaching a decision in this matter one should inspect the work of those few persons who happen to be unfortunate and are manufacturing toys for sale. That is not the best way to form an opinion as to what is good for the people as a whole. I do not object to a reasonable amount of protection, but we can best assist returned soldiers and everybody else by bringing down the cost of living. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator might have added that the exchange rate gave such an advantage to the local manufacturer that the duty was equivalent to 70 or 80 per cent., and that the community generally had to pay millions more than they would otherwise have to pay on account of the high exchange rate. There should be some way of preventing goods made in Japan or Germany from being sent to Britain for a few simple operations in the completion of the manufacturing process, and then stamped "Made in England". To put the imprimatur of Great Britain on such goods is downright dishonest. </para>

                    <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales) [11.58]. - My experience - and I have brought up a fairly large family - is that if children are not provided with expensive toys they will improvise their own, and they are usually quite as content with the least expensive ones. Personally, I would discourage the importation of costly toys from abroad. Therefore, I disagree, to some extent, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> who said that toys should not be classed as luxuries. There is no need to import toys of any description. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> says that New South Wales and Victoria seem to be the two most prosperous States, judging by their importations of toys. It is a matter for regret that some States are worse off than others, and I suppose, therefore, that it is a matter for congratulation that some States are better off than others. That toys to the value of between £50.000 and £60,000 are imported each year is a reflection on the people of Australia. We are capable of making in Australia all these articles that our children need. I am opposed to importing them from countries in which the standard of living has been reduced to starvation rates; fair competition with toys made under such conditions is impossible. </para>

                        <para>. -  The importations of maps of Australia in 1931-32 were valued at £11, and in the previous year at £414. The explanation of the differentiation in duties is that it is desired to have maps of Australia printed in this country in order to ensure greater accuracy. The Interstate Commission dealtwith this matter, and reported that there was no need to import any  maps  of Australia. At one time all maps were grouped under one heading ; the division of the item into sub-items has not altered the principle of protection to local map-makers. </para>

I am afraid that the committee is not likely to agree to a reduction of the duties, but I should like to know whether the item has been referred to the Tariff Board, and, if not, whether such action is intended. It is not right that transport should be penalized in this way. </para>

I bear testimony to its efficiency, and also to the quality of its product, which I have used for many years. But I direct particular attention to the fact that the Minister has shown that this industry has captured practically the whole of the Australian trade with a duty of 9 per cent. If that is correct - I accept the Minister's statement without any reservation - what is the reason for such enormous duties being sought by other industries? Surely it shows that industries requiring excessive duties are not as efficient as those engaged in the manufacture of binder twine. If they were, they would not need such high duties. </para>

I remind the Minister that the raw material used in the manufacture of machinery of all kinds in Australia is also an important factor, but those engaged in this class of manufacture do not obtain it free of duty. Their raw material is subject to heavy customs impost's. We have, therefore, a very clear argument why these duties generally should bereduced. </para>

Am I correct in assuming that it is item No. 212 on page 165 ? I should like some information from the Minister as to the protection afforded to sisal hemp, which, in this case, is the raw material, and which I do not think is grown in any quantity in Australia.

                            <para>- But it was used in the manufacture of binder twine. Although the raw material comes in free of duty, importers have to pay exchange. Under a duty of 9 per cent. the manufacturers of binder twine have captured practically the whole of the Australian trade, and are. producing a first-class article. While the price of wheat, and also of hay, in the handling of which binder twine is used, is so low, a heavy duty is not warranted. We have  also  to remember that the Tariff Board reported on this item as long ago as 1925. </para>

                    <para class="block">Although the raw material is imported at £21 10s. per ton, the finished article is sold at from £55 to £65 a ton. Last year there was friction in South Australia with respect to the retail price of this commodity. South Australia draws some of its supplies from Melbourne, where there are factories producing a first-class article, but one firm in Adelaide, the Adelaide Rope and Nail Works, is manufacturing some of the local requirements. Friction was caused recently, because importations from Victoria were being sold at a lower price than the local product, and an attempt was made to prevent certain South Australian distributors from importing further supplies from Victoria and selling at a lower price than the South Australian product. After investigation it was found that the Victorian farmers were purchasing binder twine at a cheaper price than that at which it was available in South Australia. I trust that the Minister will take these facts into consideration. I intend to support the request for a reduction of the duty. </para>

                        <para>. - The imports from the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and other British countries, and their value, for 1930-31 and 1931-32, will be found at the foot of page 165 of the <inline font-style="italic">Oversea Trade Bulletin.</inline> An interesting point emerges from this discussion. The argument of the honorable senator is, that as the price of wheat is low, and the manufacturer of this twine gets his raw material free of duty and is the exclusive supplier of the market, we should reduce this duty. But what would he have to pay for his raw material if the rate of exchange with New Zealand were as it was until a few months ago? That is an example of the exchange operating in a different direction. The extra cost in Australian currency would amount to 25 per cent. As a matter of fact, however, the New Zealand exchange rate is on a parity with our own, so that that consideration does not arise. But I do not ask the committee to consider the matter from that point of view. This is one of the lowest duties in the tariff, and I suggest that it be maintained. </para>

Shortly, the explanation sought by the honorable senator is, that the fuse on which duty is charged is produced in this country, whereas the other things mentioned by him are not. The Tariff Board recommended the rates that are now operating. It may interest honorable senators to know that the Ottawa agreement formula was not applied in this case; as the United Kingdom holds practically the whole of the trade, the granting of preference to it was not necessary. </para>

The importations of other fertilizers, principally from Italy and Germany, were very small indeed for the years 1930-31 and 1931-32. </para>

                    <para>In the effort to ensure that superphosphates and other fertilizers should be available to primary producers at fair and reasonable prices, the position in Australia with regard to prices and supplies of fertilizers has been the subject of very full inquiry on different occasions. During 1929, the Tariff Board made a detailed investigation into the fertilizer industry, to determine whether superphosphates were being sold in Australia at prices which were not fair and reasonable, and whether there was any necessity for new increased or reduced duties. As a result of its investigations, the board came to the conclusion that, while manufacturers were not making excessive profits, the prices charged were not fair and reasonable. The responsibility for the high prices, however, rested on the users as well as the manufacturers of fertilizers. The directions in which economies were considered possible are as follow:- </para>

                    <para>In regard to the duties, the Tariff Board expressed the opinion that . the existing duties on superphosphates of 10 per cent. British, and 25 per cent, general, which had been in operation since 1921, should not be removed. In making this recommendation it was influenced by the following factors : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Although the selling prices of superphosphate in Great  Britain were below the Australian prices, the phosphoric acid content was also lower. Compared on the basis of the phosphoric acid content of the fertilizer, the cost of landing British superphosphate in Australia if no duty wore charged would be well in excess of the Australian price for an equivalent product. </para>
                        <para>Japan, a former source of cheap superphosphate, is precluded from exporting to Australia by the price which she now has to pay for phosphate rock. </para>
                        <para>The highly concentrated double or treble superphosphate produced in America could not pay overseas freight and compute with Australian standard phosphate even if it were admitted free of duty. </para>
                        <para>Holland, where the prices vary, might occasionally ship superphosphate to Australia. </para>
                        <para>The removal of the duties would probably encourage importations, but shipments would bc too infrequent and too spasmodic to give a regular supply. Overseas manufacturers would probably be" tempted to dump occasional shipments, and thus interfere with the regularity of the operations of local factories and increase their costs of production. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Last year, the Government, in further recognition of the importance of superphosphates in the economic  development  of the primary industries of the Commonwealth, arranged with the Director of Development to conduct another inquiry into the superphosphate industry. This inquiry showed that, on the average, since the Tariff Board's inquiry there had been a slight decline in the prices of superphosphate. The manufacturers' position, however, had been rendered difficult by the decline in the production of superphosphate, resulting in higher overhead charges pelton of superphosphate. In 1930-31, the decline in production was 30 per cent. While there had been a fall in the price of rock phosphate, it was more than offset by an increase in the landed cost of sulphur. </para>
                    <para>Since the report of the Tariff Board was made in 1929, most of the companies have offered facilities and special low prices to farmers who desire to deal direct with them. Farmers generally have failed to take advantage " of this opportunity to purchase their requirements under more favorable conditions, possibly because of shortage of funds due to the low prices of primary products. Allowances are now being made ' to farmers who return empty bags for refilling. Some reductions have also been made in agents' commissions, but not in all cases to the extent suggested by the Tariff Board. </para>
                    <para>The following extract from the report of the Director of Development regarding the variations in the price of superphosphate in Australia since 1913-14, is of interest: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It is of interest to record that, in 1913-14, when the price of rock was approximately £2 7s. (id. per ton, of sulphur £4 18s. Gd. per ton, and of bags Gs. 7d. per' dozen, the list price of 17 per cent, water soluble superphosphate was £4 7s. Gd. per ton. Just after the war, the price of raw materials increased considerably, and the price of 17 per cent, superphosphate went up to £G 3s. per ton. In 1031-32, with rock costing an average of £2 5s. lOd. per ton, c.i.f., and sulphur averaging £7 10s. per ton, landed in store, Melbourne, and with bags at an average price of 9s. per dozen, the list price of 22 per cent, superphosphate (20.5 per cent, water soluble) is £4 10s. per ton for terms, and £4 10s. per ton for cash. The price of £4 10s. for 20.5 per cent, water soluble is equivalent to £3 14s. 8d. per ton of 17 per cent, water soluble. In 1913-1.4, there was no difference between terms and cash prices. </para>
                        <para>The figures indicate that, although there has been an increase in the cost of raw materials (excepting phosphate rock) since 1913-14, the price of superphosphate to the farmer has decreased by 14.7 per cent. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>With a view to increased production, the Commonwealth, under the Financial Relief Act 1932, made £250,000 available for distribution through the States to assist primary producers other than wheat-growers in the purchase of artificial fertilizers, the amount to be expended in the payment of a flat rate of 15s. a ton on fertilizer used in the production of primary produce other than wheat. The subsidy would, therefore, apply to artificial manure used, in the production of oats, maize, hops, beans, peas, apples, pears, citrus fruit, tobacco. &amp;c, and would also be- payable on fertilizers used in the top-dressing of pastures. Farmers using fertilizers for wheat-growing purposes have been assisted by bounties in another form. </para>

I suggest to the Minister that a request be made to another place to leave out the words " being statues ", so that works of art generally, of the value of not less than £10 each, might be admitted free.I know that Australian artists do not really require the existing protection of 10 per cent. British, and 20 per cent general, and if there is anything in the policy of encouraging and developing the artistic side of our people, private individuals should be allowed to import works of art duty free. I am assured that such a policy will assist, rather than interfere with, the work of Australian artists. </para>

                            <para>. - The discussion on this sub-item was postponed in consequence of an important point which was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> who asked why there was a differentiation between the duties on curtains and blinds made from wool, and those made from other materials. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>Prior to the 1921 tariff, the rates of duty on curtains and blinds were 15 per cent. and 20 per cent., whereas the duties on woollen piece goods were 25 per cent. and 30 per cent. In other cases, that is, blinds made from other materials than wool, the duties on the finished articles were higher than on the piece goods. As a result of an application by a concern interested in the production of art furnishings for either (1) reduction in duty on woollen piece goods, or (2) increase in duty on finished curtains, &amp;c, the Interstate Commission recommended increased duties on finished curtains, &amp;c., as follows: - When of cotton or linen - 20 per cent. British, and 25 per cent. general; when of other material - 35 per cent. British, and 40 per cent. general. Action along the lines suggested by the commission was taken in the 1921 tariff, and the duties on woollen curtains and blinds became higher than on the woollen piece goods from which they were manufactured. </para>
                    <para>The present position of the duties on the raw materials and the finished goods is:Raw materials - 35 per cent. British, and 55 per cent. general; finished goods  - 35 per cent. British, and 50 per cent, general. It is acknowledged that there is a slight disparity between the duties on the raw materials and those on the finished goods, but the disparity is not so great as before the 1921 tariff. </para>
                    <para>The practice of charging higher duties on articles made from wool than on goods from other materials is also followed in the case of the following items : - Group 4 - 110 (a3), blouses or skirts, not knitted; 110 (a4), girls' and women's coats, not knitted; 110 (a5), costumes, dresses, &amp;c., not knitted; 110 (b1), blouses, skirts, underwear, knitted; 110  (b3),  costumes, dresses, &amp;c, knitted. Group 5 - 120 (a), articles of textile drapery and napery. </para>
                    <para>The reason for the higher rates on woollen apparel is apparent. First, we protect the producer of wool tops with duties of 6d. per lb. and 20 per cent. British, and ls. per lb. and 20 per cent, general, while the duty on raw cotton is only 3d. per lb. general. Secondly, the manufacturer of woollen yarns is protected by duties of 6d. per lb. and  25  per cent. British, and ls. per lb. and 45£ per cent, general, which, taken by and large, are higher than the duties on other yarns, as will be seen from the following examples: - Item 121 (a)  -  Silk, 20 per cent. British, 37^ per cent, general; artificial silk, free British, 17-i per cent, general ; cotton - mercerized, free British, <inline font-style="italic">111</inline> per cent, general; bleached or dyed, free British, 15 per cent, general; single ply yarn of count 50 or finer, free British, 15 per cent, general; other cotton yarns less than No. 50 count, from 4d. per lb. and 35 per cent. British and 7d. per lb. and 55 per cent, general, to 9d. per lb. and 35 per cent. British and ls. per lb. and 55 per cent, general. </para>
                    <para>Thirdly, the manufacturers of woollen piece goods are protected to a greater extent than the manufacturers of other piece goods as will be seen from the following rates of duty : - Cotton piece goods for outerwear, weighing more than 3 oz. per square yard, per square yard, 6d. British, ls. general; and ad val., 20 per cent. British, 40 per cent, general; or alternative rates of, ad val., 35 per cent. British, 55 <inline font-style="italic">per</inline> cent, general ; whichever is the higher. Other cotton piece goods, 5 per cent. British. 25 per cent, general; silk piece goods, 10 per cent. British, 30 per  cent, general; artificial silk piece goods, 20 per cent. British, 40 per cent, general ; woollen piece goods for outerwear, weighing more than 3 oz. per square yard, per square yard, ls. British, 2s. general ; and ad val., 30 per cent. British, 50 per cent, general ; other woollen piece goods, 35 per cent. British, 55 per cent, general. . Thus the manufacturer of woollen apparel, by virtue of the higher duties on his raw material, is at a considerable disadvantage compared with the manufacturer of apparel made from other materials. It is logical, therefore, that the protection granted to the manufacturer of woollen apparel should be higher than that on, say, silk or cotton apparel. In the 1921 tariff schedule the rates proposed by the Government on item 110 b, " other apparel," were 40 per cent. British, 50 per cent, intermediate, and 55 per cent, general, but a request was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> and agreed to by the committee, that the House of Representatives be requested to provide differential rates of duty on woven undershirts, undervests, underpants, or combinations, according to whether they were made of wool or cotton. The request made was that the following duties be applied: - </para>

                            <para>Cotton 20 per cent. British, 25 per cent, intermediate, and 35 per cent, general. The request was not agreed to by the House of Representatives, and when the tariff was returned to the Senate, the request was not pressed. Differentiation is now made on underwear - item 110, b1 - according to the class of raw material from which it is' made. It will thus be seen that the committee of this chamber in 1921 was a party to the departure in tariff-making which is now being challenged. On that occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> agreed that a reduction of the , duty would put the local manufacturer at a disadvantage, although at first glance the duty appeared 'to be a penalty on .the wool industry.  </para>

                        <para>.- To make out a case against my proposal the Minister must show that the materials from which curtains are made is commercially manufactured in Australia. The fact is that these materials are not produced locally, and that is the basis of my objection to the duty proposed in the schedule. A certain rate of duty is applied to blinds and curtains of cotton or linen, and a higher rate to those containing wool. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Brown,</inline> having only limited means, buys a pair of curtains manufactured in the United Kingdom of material of a kind not produced in Australia. On those curtains a duty of 20 per cent. has been paid.  Her  neighbour, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Thompson,</inline> being more affluent, buys a pair of curtains manufactured by the same firm, but containing 1 per cent. of wool, and on them a duty of 35 per- cent. has been paid. This differentiation does not protect Australian industry, on the contrary, the higher rate against the material containing wool penalizes the wool-grower. The more we can encourage overseas manufacturers to use our wool the greater will be the demand for it. Curtain materials are not manufactured in Australia, and, therefore, are not in the same category as under-garments, which are produced locally. </para>

                        <para>. - The duty on tobacco entered for the manufacture of cigars is only 2s. British preferential, and 2s. 6d. general, whereas in group 3, under a similar division, tobacco entered to be locally manufactured into cigarettes or into fine-cut tobacco, is dutiable at a much higher rate. I wish to know from the Minister the reason for that differentiation. It seems to me that the finest leaf should be used in the manufacture of cigars, and that it is only the wealthy section of the community which can afford to buy them. Other sections are satisfied with cigarettes, and, because they are in the great majority, they are being penalized under the tariff. </para>

No leaf is grown in Australia suitable for the manufacture of cigars, and while efforts have been made to produce a suitable leaf, they have not yet been successful. No additional duty has been imposed upon this class of leaf, because it was considered that, even if the duty were raised, there would be no increase of revenue. This item has on more than one occasion been carefully examined by the Tariff Board, and the reduction of duty by 6d. has been made in accordance with the terms of the Ottawa agreement. The importations of this leaf are largely from the United States of America. </para>

                        <para>. - I give the honorable senator the official, and my personal, assurance that no cigar leaf is grown in this country. In 1925, the Tariff Board made a thorough investigation of this item, and unless this class of leaf were subject to a low duty the whole of the cigar-makers of Australia would be thrown out of employment. The Cigarmakers Union was a party to the application made to the Tariff Board for a lower duty, and this ratehas been fixed in order to encourage the manufacture of a better class of Australian cigar. </para>

Group 2 includes " items which have been amended in accordance with the Ottawa agreement but not otherwise amended ". The United Kingdom and Australia Trade Agreement sets out in part 2 of schedule F the formula which shall apply in the case of goods of the class or kind commercially manufactured in or the produce of the United Kingdom. It is contended, apparently, that this class of goods is not commercially manufactured in the United Kingdom. But the Minister has said these items are included in this part of the schedule in order that British colonies may be covered. </para>

I now direct the attention of the Minister to a provision which does not appear anywhere else in this measure to the effect that the duty on " tobacco, unmanufactured, entered to be locally manufactured into cigars " is " to be paid at the time of removal to the factory". That is a machinery provision, but no comparable provision appears elsewhere in the schedule. It seems to me that this provision violates the provision of our Constitution which says - </para>

I remind honorable senators that separate sales tax bills have to be brought down, and also separate measures providing for the collection of the taxation, in respect of each class of sales taxation. This was necessary for the reason that our taxing power under the Constitution is limited. If the provision to which I have directed attention cannot be put into effect, it should be deleted. </para>

                            <para>- As honorable senators know, all the tobacco leaf is manufactured in bond, and the duty is levied only when it is removed to stores. This is a slight concession to the manufacturers. If any one took action which had the effect of declaring unconstitutional the provision to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> has referred, it would be so much the worse for the manufacturers. It would not help the Government, but it would harm the manufacturers. I do not know that this is a taxing provision, for it simply specifies the time at which the taxation shall be paid. The provision goes back to the time of the Kingston tariff. Perhaps it is technically <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> but so far it has operated quite satisfactorily. </para>

                        <para>.- The effect of this item is to alter the British preferential duty on bananas from 8s. 4d. per cental, at which it stood from 1921 until the Ottawa agreement was made, to 2s. 6d. This subject was discussed when clause 9, which has been postponed,, was under consideration. I understand that all the items in this group of. the schedule conform with the provisions of the Ottawa agreement. I presume that the quantity of bananas admitted under the duty of 2s. 6d. per cental will be limited to the 40,000 centals provided for in the Ottawa agreement;but there seems to be no reference anywhere in the schedule to such a limitation. I wish to know whether there is any possibility of bananas from any other non-self-governing colony being admitted at a duty of 2s. 6d. per cental. I ask the Minister for a definite assurance that bananas will not be admitted at this rate from any part of the Empire exceptFiji, and that importations from Fiji will be strictly limited to 40,000 centals a year. Inno circumstances should more than that quantity be admitted into Australia. It is because the admission of Fijian  bananas to Australia is a serious matter to many primary producers in Queensland and New South Wales that I ask the Minister for an assurance that importations will be limited. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think that the Minister has quite grasped the point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> desired to have cleared up, and which I also desire to have elucidated. We recognize that the reduction of duty from 8s. 4d. to 2s. 6d. per cental provided for in this item <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> intended to give effect to the provision of the Ottawa agreement that 40,000 centals of Fijian bananas shall be admitted to Australia. We are aware of the reasons which the Minister has just given for granting this reduction. Incidentally, we also know that the concession that the £5,000 anticipated to be received from the duties on this item will be spent in assisting and encouraging the banana-growing industry, was wrung from the Government in consequence of the action taken by some honorable gentlemen in this chamber and in another place. As the present Minister will not always hold the portfolio of Trade and Customs, some provision should be made definitely limiting this concession to the40,000 centals of Fijian bananas which we have agreed to receive. Unless some provision of this kind is included in the bill, it may be argued at some future time that, as bananas are being received from Fiji, they should also be received from other banana-growing nonself -governing British colonies. It is true that the quantity of bananas to be imported from Fiji represents only 2 per cent. of the Australian consumption of bananas; but, if 2 per cent. be received from one place, 2 per cent. from another, and 2 per cent. from somewhere else, the Australian banana-growing industry will be seriously jeopardized. We have ratified the provision that 40,000 centals of bananas shall he received from Fiji, and be dutiable at 2s. 6d. per cental; but we are not prepared to agree to any further increases of banana importations. </para>

No greater quantity of bananas could be admitted to Australia unless other arrangements were made similar to those which were agreed to at Ottawa. </para>

I am not at all clear in my mind as to the meaning of the words " and also any preferences for the time being accorded to the United Kingdom if  His  Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom so request". I do not think that those words are governed by the words " at the rate shown in schedule G". To have the effect desired by the Minister, it would be necessary for those words to appear at the end of the paragraph. According to my interpretation, if, at some future date,  His  Majesty's Government should request the Australian Parliament to accord this preference to another of the non-self-governing colonies, this Parliament would have to accede to the request. </para>

It is quite possible that some other government might give a wider interpretation to that clause and article, and permit the entry of additional quantities of black-grown bananas at 2s. 6d. per cental. </para>

                            <para>- I want to be sure that the interests of the banana-growers of Queensland and northern New South Wales arc safeguarded. When the Federal Government was attacked for having consented to the admission of 40,000 centals of Fijian bananas per annum, it endeavoured to pacify those concerned by promising that a grant of £5,000 would be made for the betterment of the local industry. Of the two, the Queensland growers would certainly have preferred the prohibition of Fijian bananas. I certainly favour a return to the old duty of 8s. 4d. per cental on bananas, and I am confident that such a request will have the support of members of the Country party. In the meantime, I should like to see the sub-item postponed until we deal with clause 9. </para>

Most of the items covered here are produced in Great Britain, but, in the absence of some other arrangement, there is no means provided in this section for bringing any bananas into Australia at all. In order to see how bananas may be admitted we must turn to what is now a statutory contract between the United Kingdom and Australia, known as the Ottawa agreement. Article 15 of that agreement is as follows :  - </para>

                    <para>It is laid down that we shall give a preference at a certain rate to a particular place in respect of a particular commodity. There is a well-known maxim, <inline font-style="italic">generalia specialibus non derogant,</inline> which, in effect, means that the general words cannot limit the special words. The Ottawa agreement lays down a limit as to the rate at which bananas may be admitted, and also the quantity which may be admitted. The agreement is fixed and definite in regard to place, quantity and rates, and also defines the place of origin. The article continues - and also any preferences for the time being accorded to the United Kingdom if His Majesty's Government of the United Kingdom so requests. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so. The Ottawa contract cannot be extended or varied as regards bananas. There can be no alteration in respect to bananas, but there may be other things in respect of which it will be desirable to take action later. As a matter of fact, a proclamation may be issued in respect of only three commodities for admission under schedule G, and they are of no great importance. Even if the Government desired to admit bananas freely to the detriment of the local industry it could not do so. It could not admit more than 40,000 centals from Fiji in any one year, because that is all Parliament has assented to, and that is all the Government can allow to enter. The law does  not allow the Government to issue  a  proclamation increasing the ambit of the Ottawa agreement in respect to bananas. That may be done only in respect to the items specified. In regard to bananas, nothing can possibly happen to injure the interests of the local growers, and that assurance was given by the Government in another place. </para>

It is most important to Queensland and parts of New South Wales that there should be no chance of bananas being admitted at preferential rates from all British non-self-governing colonies. I suggest that after the word " good " in clause 9, some such words as these should be added :  " except bananas which are elsewhere specifically dealt with </para>

There is danger in this provision, because it gives the Governor-General power to agree by proclamation that the produce of Tanganyika, and other non-self-governing British colonies, and even of our own Mandated Terri tories, may be admitted to Australia at preferential rates, to the injury of the white-grown produce of Queensland and New South Wales. We wish to make sure that no government will be able to take advantage of this clause to injure the Australian banana-growing industry. </para>

                        <para>. -It is just as well for honorable senators who press for this amendment to know that, prior to 1921, the British tariff on bananas was1s. 6d. per cental, and the intermediate and general rates, 2s. 6d. per cental. I believe that the Queensland growers approached the Government of the day with a request for a slight increase of the tariff in order to obtain what they regarded as adequate protection of their industry, and the Government brought forward a proposal for a much lower rate than that which has been in force since that time. I believe that about 2s. 6d. per cental was asked for, and 4s. 2d. per cental was agreed to. </para>

                            <para>- It was eventually increased to8s. 4d. per cental, contrary to the Government's desire. Before 1921, the industry was soundly established in Queensland and northern New South Wales, but those engaged in it felt, to a certain extent, the competition of Fijian banana-growers. Since then the duty has been8s. 4d. per cental. This was intended to be a prohibitive rate, and it was prohibitive to such an extent that we lost not only the small amount of revenue that we had been getting through importations of bananas from Fiji, but also a considerable proportion of our export trade to that country, which was of no small dimensions prior to the introduction of the rate of8s. 4d. per cental. There is now a reasonable prospect of regaining some of the Fijian trade to which the Commonwealth is entitled, without doing injury to the banana-growers of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Seeing that the growers themselves asked for a lower duty than was granted, surely it is reasonable to say that the increase of the duty to 8s. 4d. per. cental was unwarranted. I accept the Minister's assurance that we have no need to fear that the quantity of bananas which we can import from Fiji under the Ottawa agreement will be exceeded, and that we need not he afraid of importations of this  fruit  from other British possessions. I am doubtful whether bananas grown in Tanganyika could be brought to Australia in a condition fit for human consumption, because, apart from the long sea voyage, they would have to be carried for great distances overland before reaching the coast. </para>

                        <para>. - It seems to me that this matter must be considered from two aspects. The Minister assures us that under this item weare merely implementing part of the Ottawa agreement, and that the quantity ofbananas to be admitted at the rate of 2s. 6d. per cental is definitely limited to the figures mentioned in the agreement. The Minister's argument is sound, if we give the English words their ordinary meaning, and the Australian banana industry has nothing to fear. This matter was discussed when we ratified the. Ottawa agreement, and although I see no danger in passing this item, there may be dangerin regard to other goods not specified in schedule G of the agreement. Our proper course is to meet that danger when it arises, and the only effective way to do so is by placing some restriction in clause 9 of the bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no sympathy with the fears expressed about the possible operation of this duty. That it might work some harm is based on the supposition that either the Commonwealth Government or the Imperial Government may violate the terras of the Ottawa agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacDonald</inline> said that the law should bo so framed that no government would be able to take advantage of it. According to article 15 of the Ottawa agreement, we are to accord to the non-self-governing colonies any. preference given to Britain "if  His  Majesty's Government  in  the United Kingdom so request." Therefore, the request would have to come from the </para>

                    <para class="block">United Kingdom, and it could come only in the form of a request, expressed or implied, that we should violate the agreement which limits this particular preference to 40,000 centals of bananas from Fiji. Therefore, all we have to fear is some request from the present or a succeeding British Government, and acquiescence in it by the present or a succeding Commonwealth Government, in violation of the Ottawa agreement. Yet, 1 cannot help thinking that, technically, there is something in the view that was expressed first by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> and has been echoed by other honorable senators. The matter may be tested in this way: Let us suppose that the British Government should ask us to agree to the admission of bananas from Tanganyika upon the preferential terms accorded to Great Britain. To ascertain those terms, the particular item in the schedule which we are now considering would have to be examined, and it would be considered regardless of what is known to be the fact, that bananas are not grown in Great Britain. I do not regard this as a matter of practical importance; but a technical point is involved. It is improbable that such a request would come from' the Imperial Government, but what would happen if it did come? If it did, there might be something in the view which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has expressed. It is impossible to separate the item in the schedule with which we are now dealing from the provisions of postponed clause 9. Speaking without having had an opportunity fully to consider this complicated question, it seems to me that the matter might be settled, and all fears allayed, if, when we come to the consideration of postponed clause 9, we made it read, " The Governor-General may, from time to time, subject to the terms of the Ottawa agreement ", do so and so. That should meet the quite groundless fears entertained by honorable senators opposi te. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the margin of preference to which article  15  refers, and there can be no other margin of preference in the case of bananas. Unless the British and Australian Governments were to agree to violate one of the articles of the Ottawa agreement - and I think honorable senators will not regard that as a likely happening - the banana industry will be fully protected. I am as interested in the banana industry as is any other honorable senator, for I claim some credit for having fixed this duty in the first place. Despite what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> has said, I am convinced that, for all practical purposes, the Australian banana-growing industry is adequately protected. </para>

                        <para>.  - I agree with all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> has said; but one difficulty remains. If the Ottawa agreement and what is stated in the schedule G regarding bananas were all that had to be taken into account, our position would' be safeguarded. But we are now asked to pass - not the Ottawa agreement, and not clause 9- but a schedule which says that, in regard to sub-item 52a, which covers bananas, the British preferential duty shall be 2s. 6d. per cental. In my opinion, the whole difficulty would be overcome if the 8s. 4d. per cental remained instead of the new rate of 2s. 6d. per cental. It seems to me that, with the new preferential rate to Great Britain in operation, any request made by the British Government, in accordance with the Ottawa agreement, for the British preferential rate to apply also to any of the non-self-governing colonies, would have to be granted. </para>

                        <para>. - At the risk of being regarded as obtuse, I rise to make my position clear. In dealing with the British preference on bananas, we have to take three things into account - first, the rate of duty, secondly, the quantity of bananas to be admitted; and, thirdly, the country whence they come. When the Ottawa agreement was made, the tariff on all bananas was 8s. 4d. per cental. The Ottawa agreement lowered the tariff barrier, and allowed 40,000 centals of bananas to enter Australia from Fiji at 2s. 6d. per cental. We are now asked to agree to the British preferential tariff being made applicable to that importation. </para>

                            <para>- We are now told that another act of Parliament would be needed to allow bananas from other countries to enter Australia at, that rate. But if a duty of 2s. 6d. per cental for the non-self-governing colonies is still in operation when a government whose members hold views on this subject, differing from those of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> comes into power, would it not be possible, without the passage of new legislation, to permit the importation of a larger quantity than 40,000 centals? This schedule does not specify importations from Fiji, and under clause 9 the importations from that source are not limited. Although 2s. 6d. per cental is the British preferential rate provided in the schedule, the scope of clause 9 is so wide as to make it possible to allow importations from non-self-governing colonies other than Fiji at that rate. I do not know whether bananas are produced in these colonies, but there is a possibility of that being done. </para>

                            <para>- We do not know whether bananas are actually growing in other non-self-governing colonies, but there is a possibility of their cultivation being undertaken  in  those countries. It has been said that the distance between them and Australia is so great that satisfactory transport is impracticable; but it may become possible to devise some means of satisfactorily transporting bananas over huge distances. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has the somewhat fallacious idea that we must increase our trade with other countries even to the detriment of our internal trade. My view is that, by developing local industries, such as the profitable production of bananas, we increase the purchasing power of our own people, which is of more value to us than the purchasing power of the natives of Fiji or of any other country. It was suggested some time ago that Fiji would provide a good outlet for Australian brandy; but we believe that it is better to have returned soldiers and others growing bananas in Australia than it is for us to increase our exportation of brandy to Fiji. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> presses his request to increase the British preferential tariff to 8s. 4d. per cental, I shall have to support the proposal, although the existence of the Ottawa agreement makes the acceptance of such a proposal practically impossible. I suggest that the item should be postponed until clause 9 of the bill has been disposed of. Honorable senators  On  this side of the chamber are strongly opposed to any action that may facilitate the importation of bananas grown under black-labour conditions, and if we had our way we would prevent the importation of the 40,000 centals annually now permitted to enter Australia. It may be said that the principle of the White Australia policy applies only to the prohibition of the employment of black labour in Australia. But we look at it from the economic viewpoint, and apply  it  beyond Australia in an endeavour to maintain our industries, all of which are carried on by white labour, by safeguarding our people against the competition of those who produce goods at the rates' of wages paid to the natives of Fiji and in the other black-labour, countries of the world. </para>

                        KINGSMILL (Western Australia) [4.20]. - I cannot understand why there should be so much debate on a subject which, to me, seems fairly simple, though I hope to be pardoned for contributing to it in the desire to bring it to a conclusion. For obvious reasons, I cannot support the request of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn.</inline>
                        Honorable senators know that, on the 2nd December last,  His Excellency  -the Governor-General assented to " An act to approve the provisions of an agreement made between  His  Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and  His  Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia. . ' . ." Under the agreement so ratified the British preferential duty on bananas was definitely fixed at 2s. 6d. per cental.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline>
                        has now moved that the House of Representatives be requested to make the rate 8s. 4d. per cental. The adoption of that request would mean the destruction of the Ottawa agreement within six months of its acceptance by the Parliament. Is that not a sufficient justification for opposing the request? Another aspect of this matter is that there are no non-self-governing colonies which can supply Australia with bananas. I do not think that bananas are grown in Togoland ; a supply from the 'Cameroons is barred by distance, and the transport difficulties, both by land and by sea in exporting from Tanganyika are so great that when that country increased its sugar production beyond its local requirements, it was in a worse position than Queensland for the disposal of its surplus. The fact that there are no non-self-governing colonies which can export bananas to Australia was largely responsible for the decision reached at  Ottawa.-

On an assurance that such an amendment will be proposed, the committee might proceed to discuss some of the more important items in the schedule. Then, if the matter ever came into court - I have no hope that it will - it might be argued that this is the latest expression of  Parliament  on the subject. </para>

A reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will disclose that the honorable senator has spoken on quite a number of occasions on this subject,, which shows that he, like  myself, is suffering from a touch of the political belly-ache. In this and in some other instances I have developed a somewhat suspicious mind, but I accept the Minister's personal assurance that the Australian banana-growers are fully protected under this item. One honorable senator suggested that we should meet the danger when it arises, but, in my opinion, the danger is now confronting us. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> who one might have thought to be making his maiden speech on this item, said that although he had not been to Togoland, Tanganyika and the Cameroons, he knew that bananas were not grown there. There is a deep-seated doubt in my mind concerning the interpretation of clause 9 of the bill. By providing for declarations by the Governor-General by proclamation it, in my opinion, makes the Governor-General paramount to Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and I have never supported, and never will, the general principles of. the Ottawa* agreement, because we regard it as a sordid bargain upon tariffs and other matters.

I am quite satisfied that Australia can produce the quality of bananas desired ; but that is not the point at issue. The position is that the Ottawa agreement, which this Parliament has adopted, stipulates that a certain quantity of bananas may be imported. I have the deepest sympathy with the Australian banana-growers, and consider that it is not in their best interests to allow the produce of other countries to be imported; but as I have not sufficient influence to secure the alteration of the agreement, I am logically compelled to support the duty of 2s. 6d. per cental. Only a certain quantity may be imported, and in twelve months there will be an opportunity to review the question. </para>

                    <para class="block">During the last election campaign, the people generally declared their opposition to prohibitory duties, and I think we may regard the general tariff on this sub-item, 8s. 4d. per cental, as prohibitive. In 1926, when this subject was being discussed in the House of Representatives, the consensus among government supporters and growers was that a general tariff of 4s. 2d. per cental was adequate. </para>
                    <para class="block">It may be urged against my requested amendment that all the items in this group comply with the Ottawa Conference preference formula; but the margin between the British preferential duty and the general tariff is very much greater than is required under the Ottawa Conference resolutions. I therefore hope that the committee will accept my request. </para>

If it is, and if the. request is returned to another place, it is not at all likely to be accepted, because that would result in the destruction of our banana-growing industry. I disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that a tariff of 4s. 2d. per cental is adequate. This was recognized by our delegates at Ottawa, because they agreed to the insertion in the agreement of provisions strictly limiting importations fromFiji to 40,000 centals annually. The Australian industry has been developed under the protection now provided in the general tariff, namely, 8s. 4d. per cental, and, as a representativeof Queensland, I say definitely that if the duty is reduced to 4s. 2d., the business of growing bananas in this country, which has been developed under white-labour conditions, will be destroyed. </para>

Probably he hasin mind the suggestion made by another honorable gentleman a day or two ago that requests from the Senate will be regarded by another place merely as gestures, indicating the majority opinion of this chamber with regard to the items in respect of which such requests have been carried. We should not, by tariff reductions, do anything to injure the banana-growing industry, which is of great importance to two States. As was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll,</inline> the carrying of this request would mean the destruction of one of the most important primary industries of Queensland, and one which is also of great value to New South Wales. In the general debate, I opposed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn's</inline> proposal to return the schedule to another place, because I regarded that proposal as a most unbusinesslike way of expressing Senate opinion on the tariff, believing that any request made to another place should be of a constructive character. I hope that we shall not have a protracted debate upon this request, but that honorable senators will indicate their views as concisely as possible in order that we may take a division which, I am sure, will show <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that "we do not regard his proposal as fair to an important Australian primary industry. </para>

The Ottawa Conference agreement to permit the introduction of 40,000 centals of bananas from Fiji does not, perhaps, convey to honorable senators an. adequate idea of what the proposal really means. It means the importation of 4,000,000 lb. of bananas, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milieu's</inline> request is for a reduction of the general tariff from Id. to -Jd. per lb. If that is accepted by this committee, and, later, by another place, it will mean the end of bananagrowing in Queensland and New South Wales. Recently, there has been a considerable expansion of the industry in New South Wales, down as far as Coff's Harbour, and it is not at all improbable that, in the course of time, the acreage under cultivation for bananas in that State will be larger than that in Queensland. Queensland growers are looking to an increase of population to improve the local demand. Recently, more land has been brought under cultivation for growing bananas, tobacco, and cotton, at Mudgeeraba. The lands of the Palmerston district in North Queensland are suitable for the growth of bananas, sugar, cotton, and other tropical products, and are capable of providing a living for thousands of Australians. If the local market is thrown open to the products of Java and other black-labour countries, the Australian banana industry will be destroyed. The proposal now before the committee is further evidence of the need for some safeguard against what might be done by a government led by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> and other advocates of cheapness. We hope the committee will reject the request so decisively as to convince </para>

                        <para>.- I am astonished that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> should propose such a request. The banana industry is just recovering from the shock of the Ottawa agreement. Fortunately, the Fijian competition is not proving so severe as had been anticipated, and local growers are managing to hold their own. Banana cultivation has been the means of settling considerable areas in northern New South Wales and Queensland. There are very few plantations employing hired labour; this is mainly a family industry, and a living can be made in it from a smaller area than would be required for any other crop. The industry is steadily advancing, and bananas are now being grown as far south as Coff's Harbour.  If  the duty in the general tariff is reduced to 4s. 2d. a cental, the banana industry will' be destroyed. Already the growers are handicapped by having to fight bunchy top and _ other diseases, which are being investigated by Professor Goddard of the Queensland University, in conjunction with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I ask the committee to recognize the difficulties with which the industry has to contend, and allow it to develop, so that lands in the northern States which are suitable for no other crop may be peopled with prosperous settlers. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> said that the banana industry was unimportant in New South "Wales in comparison with its dimensions in Queensland, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacDonald,</inline> another Queenslander has expressed the conviction that soon the industry will develop to a greater extent in New South' Wales than in Queensland. Newspapers report that, in response to requests by State Parliamentarians representing north coast constituencies, shire councils, and residents at Tweed Heads and Coff's Harbour, the Minister for Lands of - New South Wales has thrown open large areas of Crown lands in those districts for bananagrowing. Some of us realized that clause 9 constitutes a danger to Australian industry, and we equally appreciate the menace of some of the duties in this schedule. The proposed general tariff rate of 4s. 2d. would enable the heavily subsidized Matson line of steamers to flood the Australian market with bananas grown at Honolulu and Pago Pago. Similarly, the vessels trading between Australia and Singapore would be able to bring in large quantities of bananas from the Dutch East Indies. This competition would soon extinguish what is a valuable industry in New South Wales and Queensland. In those circumstances, I am sure that the committee will not agree to the request. </para>

                            <para>- We cannot really consider this item apart from our trade with Fiji. In 1925-26, the  value of our trade with Fiji was £570,000, and in 1931-32, £268,000. Our principal exports to Fiji are - Bags and sacks, beer, fancy biscuits, coal, drapery, drugs, flour, sharps, hardware, machinery, soap, ' tea, timber, tobacco, and cigarettes. Each of these industries is concerned with the promotion of our trade with Fiji, and honorable senators must realize that if we refuse this concession to Fiji in respect of bananas, that country may refuse to trade with us, and, as a result, the whole of our trade in the articles I have mentioned would be lost. In 1925-26, the value of imports from Fiji into Australia was £35,000; in 1927-28, £65,000: and in 1931-32, £16,264. During the seven years from 1925-26 to 1931-32, the value of our exports to Fiji was eleven times the value of the exports of Fiji to Australia. The Fijian report for 1930, which is the last obtainable in the Library, refers to the fact that the United Kingdom has, in the last five years, practically maintained its share of the Fijian import trade, and that Australia's share has gradually decreased. That gradual decrease is likely to continue unless we show more consideration than we seem to be showing at present for the feelings of the Fijians. Surely the committee should view this item from the point of view of the whole continent, and not from that of merely one industry in one part of the continent. Our delegates at the Ottawa Conference made to the people of Fiji this small concession, representing only 2.7 per cent., or one-fortieth, of the total production of bananas in Australia. We  agreed eventually to allow this small proportion of Fiji bananas to enter Australia for five years, reserving for ourselves 97.3 per cent, of our own trade. That was not a tremendous concession, yet, at the moment, some honorable senators are making determined efforts to prevent the importation of Fijian bananas, and, as I shall show, there has been an unfortunate reaction in Fiji itself. I am informed that an attempt was made in Australia to declare Fijian bananas black, and that the fruit agents who handled these bananas were told that they would not be supplied with Australian bananas. If that actually took place, it was a most drastic step. What has been the result? Let me read to the committee a press report, which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Adver-&lt; lifer</inline> of the 20th April last, giving the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Olive</inline> Joske,  president  of the Fijian Banana Association. I may say for the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> that I do not know <inline font-weight="bold">Major Joske,</inline> that I have never seen him, and that I hold no brief for him. </para>

                            Clive  Joske,  president  of the Fiji Banana Association, interviewed to-day on his return from Australia, said that the heavy charges in the Commonwealth made it impossible for Fiji to compete on anything like equal terms with Australian banana-growers. The duty had been decreased to 2s. Cd. a cental under the Ottawa agreement, but there was the unforeseen Commonwealth primage duty of 10 per cent, and a. sales tax of (i per cent.; also, demands were made upon shippers for income tax and unemployment tax on alleged profits. -When all charges were paid, only 8s. was left out of ' every fi for which the bananas were sold, and even this was subject to a further ls. for exchange.

                            suggests a retaliatory measure in Fiji, by way of a sales tax on Australian flour and other commodities to an extent equal to the taxes levied by Australia on Fiji shippers. " Kick back with the greatest possible vigour," he advised.

                    <para class="block">That statement is conclusive. Under the Ottawa agreement, we endeavoured to come to some sort of a trade agreement with Fiji, which involved us only in a small loss in respect of the sale of our local bananas. The agreement was, no doubt, entered into with a great deal of difficulty, and when it came into force, efforts were immediately made to prevent it from being a success. As a result, the other party to the bargain has threatened retaliation. The Fijians know as we'll as we do that they sell us only one-eleventh of what we sell them: and that, therefore, they can do us eleven times as much harm as we can do to them. I have no wish to injure the industry in Queensland and New South Wales, but we must look at this matter from a national viewpoint. </para>

                            <para>- What I am advocating is in the interests of Australia. If Fiji adopts retaliatory methods, we shall lose considerable business. Is the banana-grower to be considered at the expense of the brewer, the wheat-grower, the biscuitmaker, the coal producer, and the manufacturers of drapery, drugs, sharps, hardware, machinery, soap, tea, tobacco and cigarettes? We are selling those commodities to Fiji, and, in coming to a decision on this item, we must consider whether what we are doing does not harm the people of Australia more than the people of Fiji. I prefer to consider the interests of Australia as a whole rather than those of one industry in one part of Australia. </para>

Even if the request were agreed, to, it would probably be practically impossible for the Fijian banana-grower to compete with the Australian grower; but, at the same time, we should be holding out a hand to that country, indicating that we are not prepared to sell our goods to it without taking something in return. </para>

                        <para>. - This is one of the items - and there are many of them - which show how wise were the members of the royal commission which inquired into the disabilities of Western Australia under federation, when they recommended that the State should enjoy the right to impose its own tariff for a  period of 25 years, because it is perfectly clear, on this item at least, that a policy that may appeal to the eastern States is of no use at all to "Western Australia. During the last two years only two States, "Western Australia and New South Wales, have imported bananas. New South Wales imported bananas from Fiji on which a duty of 7s. was paid, and also from Norfolk Island, on which there was no duty at all, so that Western Australia will have to bear the whole burden of the duty under this item. The duty imposed on bananas is a federal disability, so far as Western Australia is concerned. We obtain few bananas from Queensland and New South Wales 'because, owing to the long carriage, they do not arrive in anything like the condition of bananas from Java. </para>

                    <para>According to the <inline font-style="italic">Trade Bulletin,</inline> New South Wales imported 17,309 centals of bananas in 1930-31, of which 17,23S centals came from Norfolk Island, and 71 centals from Fiji. The bananas from Fiji were valued at £121, and those from Norfolk Island at £11,902. I realize that the Norfolk Island bananas were grown by white labour. The Norfolk Islanders are very fine people. In 1931-32 New South Wales imported 12,516 centals of Norfolk Island bananas valued at £6,979. The people of Western Australia have paid all the duty that Australia has received on bananas in the last two years; excepting only 7s. - for the bananas from Norfolk Island are free of duty. In 1930-31 Western Australia imported from the Netherlands East Indies and Java, 20,725 centals of bananas, valued at £9,S94. The amount of duty paid on those importations is not shown in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> but it must have been in the neighbourhood of £12,000. </para>

                            <para>- In the existing circumstances, I do; but I hope that we will soon grow our own bananas at Carnarvon, in Western Australia. Java is comparatively close to our north-west coast. The people who live in that area are remote from railway communication, and could not possibly get bananas from Queensland. Even the people of Perth and Fremantle cannot get regular supplies of Queensland bananas. The fruit has very often deteriorated by the time it is unpacked there. In 1931-32 Western Australia imported 16,205 centals of bananas, valued at £6,079, and paid duty, amounting to £6,725, on them, which was the whole of the duty that Australia received in that year from bananas. Bananas are a nutritious and wholesome fruit. One thing that Western Australian visitors notice immediately on their arrival in Sydney is that very good bananas are purchasable there at from 6d. to 9d. a dozen. The bananas we get in Perth .from Java are good, but they cost from 2s. to 2s. 6d. a dozen. The children of the working people like bananas, but their parents cannot afford to buy them. It is significant that the population of white women in the far north of Western Australia is smaller to-day than it was twenty years ago. Ships from Java reach Derby and Broome in a couple of days, and when I was in that locality many years ago, we could buy a. stalk with about 100 bananas on it for ls., duty free. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but only in one part of the State, at Carnarvon. Efforts have been made to grow .bananas in other parts of Western Australia, but without success as a commercial proposition. I believe that the area adjacent to Carnarvon, in which bananas are at present being grown, will prove suitable for the purpose. To-day we have ships calling every week or two at our north-western ports, but as the vessels are travelling in different directions, supplies of fruit and other commodities are available from Perth once a fortnight, if so often as that. In these circumstances, I object to this duty. </para>

                            <para>- I was interested to hear the Minister say that the £5,000 which it is anticipated will be received in duty on importations of Fijian bananas would be used to assist the banana industry; but the expenditure should not be limited to the eastern States where it is already established, and only £100 offered to Western Australia. We are trying in a small way to establish the banana industry in Western Australia, and I submit that if the whole of the duty paid on importations of bananas into the eastern States is to be made available to assist the banana-growing industry in that part of Australia, we are amply justified in asking that the whole of the duty paid on importations of bananas into Western Australia - amounting in 1931-32 to £6,752, and in the previous year to about £12,000 - should be used to assist the industry in that State. A principle, which is suitable for application in the eastern States, should also be suitable for application in Western Australia. I ask the Government to accord this measure of assistance to our newly established industry. In the meantime, I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> request. </para>

                        <para>, - I did not get the full drift of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes's</inline> argument, by which he tried to convince the Senate that this request is a sound one. For the most part, the honorable senator referred to our trade with Fiji. If Ave reduced the duty on bananas by one-half, such a step would certainly be to the detriment of our banana industry. Consequently, my colleagues and I oppose the proposal. It amazes me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen, Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> and honorable senatorswho have pledged their allegiance to the Country party, should give their support to such a request. The 8,000 banana-growers in New South Wales and Queensland are being attacked by their so-called " friends ". I should like to know how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> squares his present attitude with that adopted by him on other items. </para>

                    <para>We thought it possible to achieve our object, we should advocate prohibitory tariffs that would permit our producers to gain control of the Australian market. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> declared that we are sending to Fiji eleven times more than we are receiving from that country. At one time our trade with the United States of America was overwhelmingly in favour of the States, but, in the aggregate, these matters find their proper level. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Joske</inline> has put up specious arguments in favour of an augmentation of our imports with Fiji, but, actually, that country is being compensated through its trade with New Zeland and other countries. </para>
                    <para>Our 8,000 banana-growers are producing  consumeable  wealth, and they represent a considerable purchasing power. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> request were approved by the Senate and another place, and we opened the tariff wall to cheap-grown bananas, the immediate effect would be to destroy the purchasing power of thousands of banana-growers in Queensland and New South "Wales, a policy which would have its repercussions on other sections of the community. Thousands of cases are' used annually as containers for bananas, the making of which gives a good deal of employment in the timber industry, and the annual amount of freight paid on bananas is £134,000 in Queensland and £70,000 in New South "Wales. I mention, too, that there are 26,000 acres under banana cultivation. Does that not appeal to the representatives of the Country party? </para>
                    <para>It may be that I am wrong in my opinions, and am obsessed by ideas of economic nationalism which are deplored by many. At the same time, I believe that, when viewed from all angles, those opinions are sound and good for Australia. Honorable senators' must consider what would be the result upon banana-, growers if the request were acceded to. It may be said that they could easily find employment in other industries. But in the present state of world productivity, it is practically impossible to re-employ those who are displaced from employment. I hold it to be a splendid principle that, whenever an industry has been established in Australia, no action should be taken to destroy it. This Government made a false step when it countenanced the entry into Australia of 40,000 centals of Fijian bananas annually. "We shall not improve the position in Australia by destroying our industries in order to encourage the product of black labour, of persons who are paid what are practically " rice " wages. Such an action would lower the standard of living in Australia, and have its repercussions upon all sections. I am confident that with the advance of science, and as a result of the investigations of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, we shall be able, within a year, to transport Queensland bananas to Western Australia, and market them there to the satisfaction of consumers. That is a matter which should have the consideration of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> Again I warn honorable senators not to compel this industry to - as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline> Smith, the Premier of Queensland describes it - enter into poverty competition with niggergrown bananas, for that would merely destroy our standard of living. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators . have discouraged my efforts to close the discussion. Evidently they desire that it should continue, and are open to further enlightenment on this interesting subject. When my colleagues and I endeavoured to bring back the British duty to 8s. 4d. per cental, we were charged with acting in anything but a constructive manner. I submit that our action was eminently constructive, for we were endeavouring to make impossible the admission of the products of black labour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> has advanced the argument that in attempting to secure the position of the banana industry in Australia we are jeopardizing our export trade with Fiji, and that that country will, as a retaliatory measure, discontinue to trade with us. I take it that Fiji does not trade with Australia because of its fraternal affection for us, but because it finds it convenient to obtain goods from this country which it cannot procure as favorably elsewhere. I do not believe in attempting to kill trade with other countries. There is, no doubt, much reason why the peoples of the world should trade one with another; for one thing it spreads, enlightenment. But in the war of tariffs we must, if necessary, adopt retaliatory measures, see that we are not swamped by foolishly perpetuating a benevolent non-committal attitude to other nations, while submitting to all the penalities which they impose on us through the medium of their tariffs. To say that there was nothing constructive in our proposal was to get wide of the mark. Even if the request which we supported could not have been given effect, the carrying' of it would." at least, have shown the people of this country where we stand on this matter, and why we believe that, in the interests of the primary. producers, it is essential that we either maintain an effective protection or have no protective policy at all. It is both illogical and dangerous to attempt to reduce the duty on bananas supposedly in the interests of Fiji. </para>

                        <para>. -A celebrated Scottish writer once expressed the view that the individual citizen ought to regard as a personal matter, and be personally ashamed, of any shameful act on the part of this country. I often wonder whether we, as a nation, ought not to be ashamed of our treatment of Fiji. The discussion on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> motion seems to have centred upon Fiji, although that country is not the only one concerned. Adjacent to Australia are groups of islands which belong to the British Empire, although their inhabitants are not ail Britons. We treat these people as though they were enemies ; we have no regard whatever for their corporate existence; we sneer at their " black labour " ; and describe them as " niggers." Such talk in the senior House of the Australian Parliament is, to say the least, not creditable to Australia. Whenever an attempt is made to alter the duties on bananas, the cry arises from the Opposition benches - and on this occasion, it has been supplemented by voices on this side of the chamber - that an attempt is being made to destroy the banana-growing industry of Australia. But, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> pointed out, the banana-growing industry in Queensland got along very well with a lower duty than that now in operation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> asked honorable senators on this side to justify an action which, lie said, would throw a number of Australians out of work. We do not think that that would be the result of our action, for we believe that, if the motion were agreed to, there would still be adequate protection for this Australian industry. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown,</inline> who is a younger man than I am, should read <inline font-style="italic">Things Seen and Unseen,</inline> by Bastiat, a French economist, in order that he may understand something of the indirect 'consequences of the legislation passed by any parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes,</inline> in an informative speech, anticipated the question which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> asked a little later. He pointed out that, in consequence of the embargo placed by Australia against the importation of bananas from Fiji, our trade with that country fell in a few years from £570,000 to £268,000 per annum - a drop of over £300,000. </para>

                            <para>- That it was so, was demonstrated as clearly as anything could be, because as Australia's trade with Fiji declined, so New Zealand's trade with that country increased. Our action has deprived Australia of a market for products valued at "£300,000 per annum, including manufactured articles, in the making of which numbers of Australians would be employed. It is not easy to realize the full effect of an extreme' fiscal policy; but it has at least been evident that every increase of duties has been followed by an increase of unemployment. </para>

                    <para>I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> .will resist the temptation to drag in King Charles' head on every possible occasion, though on this subject I agree with him. Western Australia is cut off from the sources from which bananas are obtained by the other States. That is particularly unfortunate, because the people of Western Australia are sadly in need of a fruit diet. Just as there has been a decline of our trade, with Fiji, so there has been a falling off of our trade with the islands to the north-west of Western Australia. There are many things which Western Australia could supply to Java and adjacent islands in exchange for the things they produce. </para>

The  only  alteration made in these duties is the elimination of the British preferential rate of1s. per cwt., as a result of the application of the provisions of the Ottawa agreement. I understand that a coco-nut tree has to be seven or eight years old before it begins to bear; therefore, planting would have to proceed apace, if the demand were to be met by. coco-nuts grown in Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- This is another item in which I think that the duties are inconsistent with what I consider to be the best policy for Australia. " Italians containing wool " refers to the textile fabric known as Italian cloth, in the manufacture of which a certain quantity of wool is incorporated. It is generally in use for only one purpose, namely, as the raw material for the tailoring trade for the lining of coats and vests, and is only manufactured in shades of black, grey and brown. There is a material known as Italian cloth which is made entirely of cotton, and this is admitted at the rate of 5 per cent. British. It is inferior as a lining to Italian cloth containing wool, because it does not give the same finish. There is not a large proportion of wool used in any Italian cloth,but medium and better class garments are lined with the cloth that contains wool, because this lining wears and keeps its shape more satisfactorily than does the cheaper lining. We ought to encourage, rather than discourage, the use of the lining which contains wool. This material is not made, I may point out to honorable senators, in Australia. It is wrong in principle to impose a heavier rate on Italian cloth containing wool than on the imitation cloth which comes in at the rates of 5 per cent. British, and 15 per cent. general. Until quite recently, the British cloth was admitted free. I move - </para>

In order to take advantage of the lower rate of duty, Italians containing wool have been replaced by a cotton Italian, the importation of which would not produce so much revenue as Italians containing wool, if permitted to enter at a lower rate of duty. </para>

It is obvious either that Australian manufacturers are meeting the local demand, or that such a small quantity is used as to he negligible; for the Minister has told us how little of this material is imported. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> would not deliberately injure any section of the Australian textile industry; hut that would be the result if his continual attempts to reduce duties, and encourage importations from foreign countries were successful.

                        <para>.- I think that my friends opposite are making a mistake. These duties do not interfere with any Australian industry. The fact that the imported cloth is not used so extensively as formerly is interfering with the sale of Australian tweed, because the use of inferior linings quickly causes suits made of Australian tweeds to be unsatisfactory with respect to the pockets, sleeves and general shape. People are apt to blame the tweed, whereas it is the lining which spoils a great many Australian suits. One cannot get cotton lining of anything like the same quality as Italian lining containing wool. All good quality clothes, whether for men or women, should have Italian lining containing wool. Even the cheap cotton linings which are so generally used now are not made in Australia. So far, no Australian manufacturers have produced a suitable lining. There is no sense in imposing a duty on a material which is necessary to improve the quality of Australian-made clothing. I speak from experience on these matters, because I used thousands of yards of this material. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so, but. when it is necessary to import goods that are not manufactured in Australia, the Labour party is anxious that the Government should get as much revenue from them as possible. This lining is not manufactured in Australia, and no attempt has ever been made to manufacture it here. The f.o.b. price in England of ordinary Italian lining containing wool is from1s. 6d. to 2s. 3d., and 2s. 6d. a yard, while the substitute lining, which has been manufactured in order to take advantage of the lower duty, costs only 8d., 10d., or1s. a yard. It must he clear to honorable senators that if, by reducing the duty on Italian linings containing wool, we make it worth while for the manufacturers in Great Britain to send that material out here, we shall reap a great deal more customs revenue because of the higher value of the better quality material. I do not wish to injure any Australian industry ; I wish to help local manufacture. If my proposal is agreed to, it will help the tailoring trade and ensure that the public get better value for their money. </para>

                            <para>- The ad valorem duties on this item were 35 per cent. British preferential, and 45 per cent. general. The duties in the present schedule stand at 35 per cent. British preferential, and 55 per cent. general, the general rate having been increased in order to preserve the stipulated margin in favour of British goods. I assume that the fixed duties bear some relation to the ad valorem duties. The Government, in order . to conform with the Ottawa agreement, adopted the simple expedient of raising the general rate from 45 per cent. to 55 per cent. Was that conforming to the Ottawa agreement in spirit, especially when we realize that already there was a duty of 35 per cent. against British goods? We are to assume that the purpose of altering the rates was to make a concession to Great Britain, but it cannot be argued that any country is receiving a concession from us when we impose a duty of 35 per cent. against its products. Did the Government's action in this respect conform to article 10 of the Ottawa agreement, which provides- </para>

                        <para>. -  The only alteration in the previously existing duties was an increase in the general rate from 45 per cent. to 55 per cent. so that there should be a margin of 20 per cent. in favour of British goods. This is one of the items with which we have had to deal in the absence of any immediate report from the Tariff Board. We have in our possession, however, a report from the board dated 1929, in which these items, and others of a similar kind, were fully reviewed, and the present British duties recommended. We have, perforce, to pay regard to such a recent report, particularly as the board was then beginning to apply certain principles which have recommended themselves to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> and some other honorable senators. Britain is not complaining about our action. She knows that this and other items will have to be further reviewed. Unfortunately, it was one of those cases in which we could not get the Tariff Board to say whether the principles observed when fixing the duty complied with the principles of the Ottawa agreement. The matter was far too complex; and, having regard to the recent submission of the board's report on this item, honorable senators will see that we would have taken on our shoulders very serious responsibilities had we, by governmental action, provided the margin of preference by reducing the British, instead of increasing the foreign, duties. This is a typical example of many such cases, and I am glad that the honorable senator has selected it. In 1929, the board inquired into a request for increased duties, but the applicants intimated that their request was not intended to cover rubber bathing caps. As no representatives of the local manufacturers of those caps appeared to give evidence, the board recommended that the existing rates upon them should not be disturbed. Accordingly, they have been maintained. If we had reduced the rate by 10 per cent., we might have disturbed the margin that enables the local industry to continue its operations; consequently, the other course was adopted, and no exception to it has been taken by the British Government. We contracted with them, and they with us, that a report should be obtained from the Tariff Board, and that the principles laid down at Ottawa should be observed. They are being observed under clause 13 of the bill, and they will be applied by the Tariff Board when it examines this and other items in the same class in accordance with the statutory direction given by the United Kingdom and Australia Trade Agreement Act. It would have been almost impossible, having due regard to the safety of this industry, to make the Ottawa adjustment in any other way purely as a temporary measure. The question will he reviewed when the items come before the Tariff Board; and, should the British rate be reduced, there will be a corresponding decrease of the foreign rate, so that the margin of preference may be preserved. </para>

                        <para>. The Minister has referred to a report of the Tariff Board made in 1929. It has to be remembered, however, that in this schedule we are dealing with the Ottawa agreement. What considerations weighed with the board in 1929, I do not know. As I have already said, I have selected this item, not because I have any knowledge of it, but because it seems to me to afford an illustration of a variation from what was undertaken in the Ottawa agreement. </para>

                            <para>- I concede that that is so. But when the Government, without reports from the Tariff Board, had to frame a schedule embodying the principles laid down in the Ottawa agreement, had it not the responsibility of so framing it that it would meet the provisions of article 10 of that agreement? If, however, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> says, article 11 is to come into operation - that, in fact, all these items are to be referred to the Tariff Board, and that, in fixing the duties, the board will bear in mind the terms of the Ottawa agreement - and upon receipt of the reports of the board, Parliament will be invited to vary the duties, much of my objection is removed. </para>

We can leave to the future whatever we on this side may have to submit to when the report of the Tariff Board is to hand, and the variations necessary under it are made. There is established in Brisbane a very fine rubber-manufacturing industry, an important item of whose output is rubber bathing caps. The North Australia Rubber Manufacturing Company, which has its head-quarters in Brisbane, makes this and all other kinds of rubber goods, and sells them everywhere in Australia in open competition with firms that have been much longer established. </para>

                            <para>- As I informed the honorable senator the other night, there are only two classes - that which does the work, and that which " does " the workers. I am not a representative of the latter. But, speaking seriously, this is an important matter. I know that the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> is the amount of duty levied under the British preferential tariff. I take it that there are two ways of fulfilling the terms of the Ottawa agreement, one of which - increasing the tariff against the foreigner, and thereby giving British preference a better chance to function - is not favoured by honorable senators opposite. </para>

                            <para>- The reduction of the British tariff would open the door to British competition, to the danger of the particular industry to which I am referring. As I have said in this chamber over and over again, Australian workmen  and their dependent families would suffer just as much whether their industry was ruined by British or by any other competition. Even the Government would not approve of that sentiment. The bald fact that I wish to emphasize is, that this great and flourishing industry has to meet the fiercest competition from foreign countries, particularly Japan, which are putting bathing caps, surf balls, and other rubber goods of that kind, on the Australian market, at prices at which the local industry cannot compete. I was invited to go over the works of the Narm company just before I came to Canberra for the present meeting of the Senate. The manager then assured me that even if they could get their rubber for nothing, they could not put these articles on the market at the prices at which the Japanese are flooding the market. </para>

                            <para>- It is hopeless to try to convince <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy.</inline> These particular articles are put on the market by the Australian manufacturer at a gross profit of 121/2 per cent. in order to retain the trade. That means that there is no net profit, because the overhead costs equal that percentage. I have seen the factory figures, and know that that is so. I wish honorable senators to realize that this industry is of importance to all the States. I have dealt with the Queensland company because I am intimately acquainted with it; but there are companies making these articles in the other States. If the Brisbane company is subjected to any fiercer competition, whether British or foreign, it will have to go out of existence. </para>

Hoop iron n.e.i. is free British, but there is an ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the general tariff, in addition to which a deferred duty of 70s. British, and 120s. general will operate as from the 1st October next.

The deferred duties have been, extended from time to time, the last extension being from April of this year, and they will not become operative until the manufacturers actually begin making the wider widths of hoop iron. If the honorable senator will look at the sub-items of item 136 in group 1, he will find that rates of duty, similar to those provided for in these deferred duties, are already operating in respect of hoop iron1/8 inch in thickness in widths of3/4inch,7/8 inch, and from 1 inch to 2 inches, both widths inclusive. </para>

When replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> who has been a strong critic of the Government in this matter, I emphasized that we should have to bring down a number of tariff schedules from time to time as reports come from the Tariff Board. I venture the opinion that this Parliament will be known as the Tariff Parliament because, for the next eighteen months or two years we shall be required to deal with a number of amending tariff proposals, all of which will be based upon the schedule now under consideration. I agree entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> that there is little to be gained by debating items appearing in groups 1 and 2, in which the rates are the same as those operating in the 1930-31 tariff, except in those items which have been altered in accordance with the Ottawa agreement. We have had no recent Tariff Board reports upon these items, so that, as far as we have gone, we have been merely re-enacting the existing tariff. But, as I have explained, it is important to have a complete schedule ratifiedby Parliament upon which we can build a new tariff in the terms of the Ottawa agreement. That is the objective of the Government. </para>

                        <para>The schedule contains a number of rates which in accordance with the provisions of the customs tariff are deferred from time to time until manufacturers are in a position to meet a reasonable proportion of the requirements with goods of satisfactory quality. In some cases these deferred rates were inserted in the tariff schedule as a result of inquiry by the board at some previous date; others have been there for many years. The retention of these deferred duties in the schedule for so long periods is liable to induce persons to launch into what might then be an uneconomic industry, for, even assuming that the rates were justified when they were placed in the schedule, it does not follow that the position is the same to-day. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the position as to the operation of the duties causes a serious and costly dislocation of business. </para>

Reference to item 136, sub-item f1, shows that the hoop-iron industry has extended its operations. Clause 12 of this bill provides - (1.) Where a deferred duty on any goods is provided in the schedule, the Minister shall refer to the Tariff Board for inquiry and report the question whether the deferred duty should or should not operate on and after the date to which it has been deferred. </para>

                        <para>. - The Ottawa Conference considered the tariff schedule as it was at that date, including the deferred duties. The British Government argued that where no capital expenditure had been incurred by an industry, the deferred duties relating to it were to be deleted, but where capital expenditure had been incurred, the deferred duties would have to run the gauntlet of article 12. As far as has been practicable, the Australian Government hasgiven effect to the agreement. In respect of several items upon which no capital expenditure has been incurred, the Minister has already, following departmental inquiries, cancelled the deferred duties. I understand that in respect of the item now under consideration, capital expenditure has been incurred. </para>

                            <para>- If a duty were imposed upon cream separators, it might be the means of having the industry established in Australia, particularly as the foreign manufacturers of these machines charge such exorbitant prices, the average percentage increase over landed cost being 81 per cent. Honorable senators supporting the Government have told us time and again that the primary producers are being robbed by the manufacturers of Australia. In this instance the primary producers are being robbed, and the machines are not made here. I suggest that, if a duty were placed upon cream separators, some enterprising Australian firm might commence the manufacture of cream separators, and help to reduce costs. </para>

                        <para>. - Prior to the introduction of this tariff all classes of separators were admitted free of duty, but. now the duty on foreign separators is to be 15 per cent. This is. another example of the doubtful benefits that are being conferred upon the primary producers under the Ottawa agreement. Cream separators are essential for dairy farming, and, as honorable senators well know, that industry has always been a struggling one. It is maintained by the dairyman, his family, and employees, working long hours at certainly not arduous but tedious work for a comparatively small return. The bulk of the separators used in Australia are of foreign manufacture. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Oversea Trade. Bulletin</inline> of 1931-32, we imported cream separators as follows : - </para>

                    <para class="block">We also imported separators from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, and other foreign countries. </para>
                    <para>If we are compelled to grant this preference in order to conform to the Ottawa agreement, I shall not try to alter it, but, if not, I intend to move that the House of Representatives be requested to eliminate the foreign duty of 15 per cent., because it undoubtedly tends to increase the cost to the dairyman. Recently, we were forwarded by the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in Australia a number of illuminating extracts from the Swedish <inline font-style="italic">Trade J</inline><inline font-style="italic">Journal,</inline> dealing with Australian trade with Sweden, and in those extracts it was pointed out that that country was a good customer for various classes of Australian products, but that Australia in return did not purchase anything like a similar value of Swedish exports. When the supporters of the Government seek the reduction of a duty which they claim is against the interest of an Australian primary industry, they talk a good deal about the necessity for allowing the goods of foreign countries, who are prepared to buy Australian products, the right of free, or comparatively unimpeded, entry into Australia; but we do not hear those honorable senators protesting against this duty which is not only offensive but also inimical to a good foreign customer for certain classes of Australian products. </para>

                            <para>- Cream separators may be imported free of duty from both the United Kingdom and Canada. During recent years, there has been rapid development in the United Kingdom in the manufacture of these goods, and although the range produced is not so wide as in -other countries in which "the industry has been established for many years, it is certainly extensive. At Ottawa, the United Kingdom delegation strongly pressed that the formula margin of preference should be granted to these goods. The Australian delegation acceded to this request, and was indeed glad to do so in view of the fact that the United Kingdom delegation had agreed to a grant of preference on Australian butter to the extent of lid. per lb. I may state that the representatives of the Australian dairying industry, who discussed this matter with the Australian delegation before it left for Ottawa, said that they would be quite agreeable to granting a preference on cream separators provided that the delegation obtained a preference on butter. That preference was obtained. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> has complained that certain classes of cream separators are not manufactured in the United Kingdom. Let me inform him that there are certain of the larger sizes not being manufactured in the United Kingdom, and in respect of these, admission free of duty will continue from foreign countries under by-law. With respect to the importation of spare parts of foreign separators intended to be used for the repair of separators at present in use, a decision has already been given for the continuance of free admission from foreign countries. </para>

                        <para>. - I recognize, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> has interjected, that since this duty has relation to the Ottawa agreement it is impossible for us to suggest any alteration to it. I wish to emphasize that the figures which I gave in respect of foreign makes of cream separators are quite authentic, and were obtained by a royal commission which last year sat in Queensland and inquired into the scandal of secret commissions paid by the agents of butter factory machinery of all kinds to butter factory managers and others who had no right to accept such commissions. An examination of the books of the agents for these thirteen brands of separators disclosed that the difference between the landed cost of the separators in their warehouses, and the price charged for them to the dairy farmer, was as I have indicated. I was hopeful that under this item we might he able to do something to alter that practice, but after hearing the explanation from the Minister, I realize that we cannot do anything in that direction. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think that the point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> endeavoured to make regarding our trade with Sweden was sound. I understood him to say that the duty in the general column should be reduced from 15 per. cent. to nil on account of the fact that we did considerable business with Sweden. If the honorable gentleman will look at the particulars on page 559 of the <inline font-style="italic">Oversea Trade Bulletin,</inline> No. 29, he will find that Sweden sends enormously more of her products to us than we send of ours to her. The figures for 1931-32 show that our imports of Swedish origin were valued at nearly £700,000, while our exports to Sweden were valued at only £252,000. We were actually taking about three times as much from Sweden as she was taking from us. The honorable gentleman's argument seems to break down at that point just as badly as it broke down at the other point. </para>

                    <para>Prior to the signing of the Ottawa agreement adding and computing machines and all attachments were British, free, and general, 10 per cent. At the request of the British delegation the rates were altered to British, free; and general, 20 per cent. Since the imposition of the duty of 20 per cent. under the general tariff, representations have been made to the department that no adding and computing machines are manufactured in the United Kingdom.  His  Majesty's Senior Trade Commissioner has advised us that the only machine of this nature manufactured in the United Kingdom is a tabulating machine. The tabulating machines referred to, however, do not come under this item, but are specifically mentioned in item 174 (x) (73), and are dutiable, British, free; and general, 15 per cent. Adding and computing machines are expensive office appliances, and have a material hearing on efficiency. There is no reason why the duty of 20 per cent. under the general tariff should be retained, seeing that the United Kingdom is not in a position to supply our requirements. The increased duty on adding and computing machines was made solely in connexion with the Ottawa agreement, but as these machines are not being manufactured in the United Kingdom, the Government desires the duties to revert to those operating under the 1921-30 tariff. </para>

                    <para class="block">Information furnished to me by persons interested in the mining industry in Western Australia shows that practically all the machinery required for gold mining operations is covered by these four items, and a couple of others which appear in other parts of this schedule. </para>
                    <para class="block">One of those items was dealt with in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> request last night. The honorable senator moved for a reduction of the duties on that item from British, 40 per cent., to 15 per cent. My request in regard to these four sub-items is for a proportionate reduction from 271/2 per cent. to 10 per cent., although I would prefer that these items should be free of duty. It is interesting to compare these four sub-items with sub-item e, " coal-cutting machines ", which are admitted free from Great Britain. These coal-cutting machines are similar to a good deal of the machinery covered by the four sub-items to which my request relates, and I can see no reason why there should be a discrimination against the gold-mining industry at a time when Australia should be doing everything possible to stimulate the production of gold. Honorable senators know that several big developmental gold-mining enterprises are in active operation at present, and endeavours are being made in London by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Bernales to obtain financial support for other projects of the same kind. Some of the enterprises now operating were greatly helped by the action of the Scullin Government in allowing the required machinery to come into Australia duty free under by-law. I refer particularly to the heavy machinery required at Wiluna and Mount Isa. </para>

                            <para>- That is true; but so, also, has the higher price of gold. About 70,000 men are directly employed in mining operations in Australia, and this industry deserves every encouragement from the Senate. Even with a duty of British, 10 per cent., the mining machinery covered try sub-items a, b,c and d, will he at a disadvantage compared with the coal-cutting machinery covered by sub-item e. I have been furnished with some information on this subject, collated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vail,</inline> of the Wiluna and Lake View Companies, which was used in connexion with his opposition to an application made to the Tariff Board on the 16th December, 1931, for a duty on power oil. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vail</inline> writes - </para>

But the enormous quantities of this low-grade ore encouraged us to devise ways and means of reducing costs, which would permit of continuing the industry. The best engineers procurable were employed, and, after a thorough and painstaking examination, reports were submitted which indicated that, with an enormous expenditure of capital on plant, equipment and development work, it would be possible to reduce costs so that this low-grade ore could be mined and treated at a profit. </para>

                            <para>- It did. I have seen a letter from the  chairman  of directors of the Wiluna Gold Mines admitting that, without the moral effect that was provided by the bounty, the company would not have been able to raise the additional capital that it needed. When it first began operations it expected to spend only £300,000, but ultimately it had to disburse £1,200,000, and even then had to appeal to the Federal and State Governments for assistance. In December last there were 700 men working at the Wiluna mine, a number that has since been increased by at least 150. The company has spent on fuel and oil power alone a sum amounting to £145,000, while its expenditure on plant and equipment up to the 31st December, 1931, was £598,317. Since then at least £100,000 has been spent on the erection of a new power unit, which enables agreater quantity of ore to be crushed. The Lake View and Star Company has disbursed £70,000 on new power equipment, and it is committed to an outlay of £375,000 for machinery and plant. </para>

                        <para>.- The Tariff Board made a report on sub-item a1 on the 31st March last, in which it definitely and strongly recommended duties of 271/2 per cent. British, 35 per cent. intermediate, and 40 per cent. general, and I strongly urge the Senate to reject the honorable senator's request on this sub-item. The report also dealt with the efficiency of the Australian industry in the production of certain classes of mining machines, and I mention, in passing, that we have a small export trade in this line to New Guinea, the Dutch East Indies, and Malay States. The other sub-items which are affected by the honorable senator's request have been referred to the Tariff Board, and are now receiving consideration. Coal-cutting machines and rotary and percussive rock drills have been admitted free of duty from the United Kingdom, and the importations under sub-itemsc and d have been very small, amounting to only £301 in 1931-32, of which £106 worth was admitted under by-law. The importations under sub-item b amounted to £21,026 in 1931-32, machines to the value of £5,887 having been admitted under by-law during that period. The machinery covered by subitems e andf is admitted free if from </para>

The department at all times gives very careful consideration to applications for the admission of mining machinery under by-law. In 1925, the Tariff Board reported that the local manufacturers of the machines covered by this item were able to supply Australia's requirements at reasonable prices, and it recommended that the then existing rates of British, 271/2 per cent., and foreign, 40 per cent., be not disturbed. Sub-items b, c, d were referred to the Tariff Board on the 2nd March last. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the request. Most of the mines at present operating in Australia, particularly the bigger ones, are now working on low-grade ore. In order to produce profits, or, indeed, to keep going at all with such ore, it is necessary to alter and improve the plant from time to time. Most of the bigger mining companies employ highly-qualified engineers whose business it is to make such alterations as are necessary to deal with the varying geological formations. I said last night that Australia had some of the finest metallurgical engineers in the world. These men are doing much for the development of mining in Australia, and are extracting from the ore all the metal that can profitably be obtained from it. I do not think that by lowering the duties on this item we shall in any way affect the establishments now making mining machinery in Australia. </para>

At those rates, the importation of nails is practically prohibited. I am? informed by men in the trade that, as the result of these duties, high-grade nails are not now procurable in Australia, and that the prices of the lower grade nails are so prohibitive that, in many instances, fruit-growers find it cheaper to collect and use second-hand nails than to buy new ones. The making of nails is practically an automatic process involving a limited amount of manual labour. </para>

The only alteration that has been made in these duties is an increase of the general rate as compared with the British preferential rate, and I ask the committee to reject the requested amendment on the ground that nails are  efficiently made in Australia. The importation of nails was prohibited from the 4th April, 1930, to August, 1932. I understand that all nails required in this country are made here, and I see no good reason to alter the rates. </para>

                            <para>- It must have been a long time ago. The manufacturers sell their nails to a ring, and business men are compelled to buy from the wholesalers, who, by private arrangement with the manufacturers, make a certain gross profit. While Labour senators are advocating high tariffs, they are also propping up a monopoly of the worst kind. I do not suggest that Australian nails are not of good quality ; but, under this tariff, the nail-making and kindred industries are not giving the public a fair deal. </para>

                    <para>. - I take this opportunity to refer to what I regard as the somewhat ungenerous attackon the Country party made last night by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> He laid the whole blame for the Government's position in regard to the tariff on the Country party. I remind him that there were only four members of the Country party participating in divisions in which the voting was fourteen to fifteen against the Government. Further than that he charged us with having opposed our own tariff. This is the first occasion since any Country party member has been in the Senate that a general tariff schedule has been considered. A small schedule was submitted in June, 1926. I, who was the first of our party to enter the Senate, came here on the 1st of July, 1926. A few items were considered in 1928, and I think the records will show that on these items we voted in exactly the same way then as now. The Leader of the Senate also said, quite truly, that the Government of 1928 could not have carried on for a day without the support of the Country party. I freely admit that, but I beg to point out that when the Country party, or any other party, is faced with two alternatives, it does what most sensible people would do - it chooses the lesser of two evils. If a man is between the devil and the deep sea, he will, if he can swim, take to the sea, and that is the course we pursued. Had we not supported the Government of that day, the alternative would have been a government that would have introduced still higher duties. That is what eventually happened, but I am proud to think that when the axe fell that ended the life of the Government, there was no Country party hand on the handle. The Country party stood 100 per cent. solid behind the Government, which was defeated because of defections within its own ranks. In view of what was said last night, it is only right that I should speak on behalf of the small party in this chamber of which I am a member. The right honorable gentleman may now realize that he was a little unjust to us. I can only suggest as the reason the fact that he is under a rather severe strain at the present time, and consequently spoke somewhat more warmly than the occasion warranted. </para>

                    <para>[10.21]. - I would remind honorable senators that I am not quite a worm. I admit that I was labouring under a strain last night. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> would seem to suggest that my remarks were made without reference to anything that had gone before. Let him carry his mind back, and he will recall that I was the object of sneers by Senators Hardy and Badman, as to the indignity suffered by the Government on account of its reliance upon the support of the Labour party to secure the passage of the tariff. Apparently, I was expected to sit quietly under that attack, and not to justify the position of the Government; but I am so built that, when I am subjected to such attacks, I hit back. I very much regret if, in hitting back last night, I hit </para>

                    My remarks were aimed, not at him, but at those who had sneered at the Government. But I was also under another strain that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline>
                    appears to have overlooked, namely, that caused by the revelation of Senators Rae and MacDonald, that two members of the Country party had sought the assistance and the votes of those with whom they had accused us of associating. Because of that revelation, I felt a certain degree of anger. It was made to appear that, although we should be ashamed of having voted side byside with the Labour party, it was not a crime for members of the Country party to seek the votes of that party.
