Four cases are concerned, of which two are purchasers and the remainder weekly tenants. The former are indebted for instalments, rates and charges, to the extent of £384 and £282 respectively, the period of arrears equalling 37 and 58 months. The arrears of each tenant exceed 26 weeks. Each is hopelessly involved, and, consequently, was requested some months ago to secure other accommodation. Whilst realizing their position they declined to vacate the homes, and, in the circumstances, the War Service Homes Commission was reluctantly compelled to institute final action. </para>

                        <para>. - I have had an opportunity to examine closely the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes, and its effect upon these sub-items. As the same principle is involved in other items still to come before the committee, I think it desirable to state what is being done in an attempt to afford some security to manufacturers and importers. Subitem c, which immediately follows the two sub-items in respeet of which thehonorabie senator has proposed a request, ia the operative sub-item. At present, should a manufacturer represent to the Minister that he is making tools admitted under by-law, the Minister can, of his own volition, include such tools in sub-item b, which is a drag-net provision in which tools removed from sub-item c would ordinarily be included. That is not a scientific method, and it is one that it unfair to both manufacturers and importers. A case may be made out to the Minister controlling the department, or to the departmental head, that may appear so convincing that goods being admitted under by-law may be included into a dutiable class to the detriment of those immediately concerned. Having regard to the fact that the Government and the department are reviewing all the articles now admitted under by-law, I trust that the honorable senator will not press his request. The departmental officials are quite definite in their opinion that some should be admitted free; but there are others which will be dealt with in whatever way is considered best. To deal with this intricate problem in a haphazard fashion would be embarrassing to importers and to manufacturers. Although the present arrangement may appear unsatisfactory to primary pro-' ducers, the inquiry which the department has in hand should overcome the difficulty. At present, spades are admitted under by-law, but shovels are on the dutiable list. There must be a good reason for that. </para>

                    <para class="block">I shall have to oppose the honorable senator's request, because the whole matter is being dealt with by the department, and because it is impracticable to deal with it as he proposes when so many interests are affected. There are many points which I would willingly concede to the honorable senator, but, if the honorable senator's request was adopted, goods would be imported to the detriment of manufacturing industries in this country. The department proposes to suggest that tools admitted under bylaw, which are not being manufactured in Australia, should be included in the schedule, if British, free, and under the general tariff at 15 per cent. Goods not manufactured in Australia will be admitted under by-law wherever practicable. I am sure honorable senators wish the department to be conducted with as little disturbance as possible, and if my suggestion is adopted, that will be facilitated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> referred to certain tools of trade which, if admitted free of duty, would have a very disturbing effect upon some branches of industry. In doubtful cases, the Tariff Board will examine the whole position, and decide whether the articles should be admitted free under by-law or be included in the schedule at specified duties. No fewer than 365 kinds of machines are so included in group 7, and admitted free of duty, because they are not manufactured in Australia. In view of all the circumstances, the department should determine which articles should be admitted under by-law, and which should be included in the schedule. Any doubtful cases will be referred to the Tariff Board. The present system should be altered, but the refining method, as it is termed in the department, should not be undertaken hurriedly, owing to the risk of interference with the activities of certain industries; The list of goods admitted free under by-law includes scores of different sorts of tools. A number of those tools to which the honorable senator referred are undoubtedly admitted free under by-law; but after investigation, may be embodied in the schedule. I ask the honorable senator not to press his request which, if adopted, would be embarrassing to the department, and have a disturbing influence upon trade. The honorable senator can rest assured that unless there is real evidence that they can be manufactured here they will be included in the schedule. If a prima facie case is made out that goods ' can be economically manufactured in Australia, an inquiry is conducted by the Tariff Board to determine the position. Any one making such a request would have to satisfy the Minister and the departmental officers that the manufacture of such goods could be economically undertaken in Australia. If any manufacturer considers that he has a good case for tariff protection he should run the gauntlet of the Tariff Board. Surely this method of dealing with these items is better than the loose method adopted in the past. This is one of many items which we shall have to consider from that aspect as we proceed with the schedule, and it. is the first that up to the present has been refined - as the term is - by the Customs Department. It is extraordinary that an honorable senator so well equipped as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> did not know that tools of trade entered this country free. It is therefore high time that the true position should be fully set out in the tariff. </para>

                            <para>- I made a careful note of the honorable senator's remarks, and he stated definitely 'that the workers have to pay for tools of trade. On the north coast of New South Wales, where Crown lands have recently been opened up, shire councils have let out the work of road-making to various contractors. Some of the contractors, who are operating in a big way, have sub-let portions of  the work. In most instances, the contractors supply tools of trade to the subcontractors, but occasionally the subcontractors, consisting of from six to twelve men, have to buy their own longhandle shovels. Eut bar jumpers, crowbars, and wedges, which are forged from 3teel, and not made by mould, are manufactured by the shire councils and the municipalities in' their workshops. The Minister has stated that tools of trade enter, this country free of duty, but I should like the manufacturers of Great Britain to receive preference over foreign manufacturers. Nearly all the tools of trade sold at the chain stores operating in every capital city, are of Gel-man origin. I have no wish to be vindictive towards the manufacturers of German or any other foreign country, but if we on this side are unable to obtain protection for the local manufacturer, we prefer to place the trade in the hands of the manufacturers of Sheffield and Birmingham. </para>

                        <para>Following the imposition of the rates introduced under resolution of 26th March, 1931, W. H. Plumb (Australia) Limited, decided to confine the whole of their activities to the manufacture of tools of trade. it is true that the Australian factories do not employ many artisans; but this is a subsidiary industry to the iron and steel and the coal industry, and therefore deserves every encouragement at our hands. The statement continues - lt is interesting to note that since the introduction of a higher tariff of 55 per cent. British preferential, 75 per cent. general tariff, the overseas manufacturers reduced the price of most lines, especially picks, as much as 25 per cent., thus proving that they were penalizing the Australian user when there was no internal competition. Since the introduction of this tariff the Australian manufacturers consistently improved their products, and have reduced prices of the numerous lines manufactured up to 50 per cent. Unfortunately their overseas competitors are endeavouring to retain the business by selling below the true domestic home value. </para>

                    <para class="block">We know that vessels outward bound from Great Britain meet the British manufacturers more than half way with respect to the general charges for cargo. In addition, the British manufacturers have the advantage of lower wages and better working conditions, from their point of view, than those existing in Australia. The standard of living of the British worker is not so high as that of the Australian worker, and, therefore, the Australian manufacturer, compared with the British manufacturer, is at a disadvantage. That fact, I submit, is a strong argument in favour of protecting the Australian manufacturer. The statement to which I have already referred, continues - </para>

                        <para>There are now some fifteen firms manufacturing tools of trade in New South Wales and Victoria, foremost amongst them being W. H. Plumb (Aus.) Limited, of Sydney, who employ CO hands to-day against eight two years ago, but to enable them to effectively secure the Australian . market, the duty on picks and mattocks, particularly, should be increased to 55 per cent. British, thus ensuring that these lines will be conserved for Australia. Another important factor in regard to tools of trades is that it is a subsidiary of the steel industry, which must be permanently established in Australia for our own protection. Efficiently equipped tool factories would be of inestimable value to Australia in time of war. </para>

                        <para>Although the total value of picks imported in 1931-32 was £567, the imports for the first seven months of the current year are almost £1,100, representing over 17,000 pick heads (apart from mattocks), which represent a considerable amount of employment lost to Australia. Importation statistics do not yet show mattocks separately, and it is considered that the import of these tools is as great, ifnot greater, than picks. </para>

                        <para>.- I thank the Minister for his clear explanation of the position with regard to tools of trade. I have no doubt as to his sincerity, and I agree with him that the matter is a most complex one. I have been studying the two items in the tariff schedule, and I have before me the Tariff Board's report; but it is most difficult to dissect the various items. I think that the best course would be for the committee to accept my request for an amendment. We cannot draft legislation of this kind at the table; it is a matter for investigation by officers of the department after the request has been considered in another place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> referred to mattocks.

Can anybody justify such an absurd impost? The mattock is a common tool that every farmer and road man uses. There is every justification for sending duties such as this back to the other chamber. </para>

                        <para>At present, the Australian manufacturer has the advantage of an exchange rate which represents an additional protection  of 27* per cent, ad valorem, lt is, of course, generally hoped that the existing adverse exchange position will prove to be temporary. If, before the exchange reverts to more norma] conditions, the prices of iron and steel in Australia should full or if labour costs or other charges should be further reduced, then it should be possible for Australian manufacturers to continue the production of a considerable range of tools of trade without undue cost to the users. If, on the other hand, costs are still maintained, the board is of the opinion that the local production of those tools, which would require protection in excess of the rates suggested, namely, 35 per cent.

In my opinion, the duties are uneconomic  now, and I am afraid that I cannot withdraw my request. These tools should be admitted free in the interests of the primary producers and the workers. </para>

                        <para>. - Why should not tools of trade for the use of artisans and mechanics, and tools in general use, be admitted free of duty? Instead of imposing duties of 35 per cent, and 45 per cent., subject to admissions tinder by-law, why not at least make the rates free and 20 per cent., or even 10 per cent, and 25 per cent'.? It seems to me that we see the operation of the by-law-making power at its very worst. 'We have been shown page after page of items relating to things that have been admitted free. That harmonizes with my general view that such things should be free; but the principle on which the by-law power is operated is extremely dangerous and unsatisfactory. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. This is not even legislation by regulation. A regulation has to be laid on the table of both branches of the legislature, and may be disallowed by either House within a limited period. That means that a regulation, like a law, has to be passed by both Houses ; but these by-laws never come before the Parliament. We never see them, we know nothing of them, and we do not know who makes them. We do not know who is the moving power behind the persons who actually make them. They do not bear even the Minister's signature. I quite admit that we have given this power under the customs law. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators appear to think that the alteration desired may be made merely by a stroke of the pen. It took four months of intensive work to reach the stage at which metals and machinery items in group 7 could be taken out of the category of bylaw admissions and included in the tariff. The object of the Government is to have the tariff founded on a definite principle. During the term of office of our predecessors, Ministers felt that they were being unduly pressed by requests for the admission or exclusion of items under the by-law power. That pressure is constant in the department, and as a matter of self-defence and sound administration the Minister has approved, and the department has determined, wherever possible, to have such items placed in the tariff. Once that is done, they cannot be removed without the sanction of Parliament, and no greater security than that can be given. Proper administration necessitates an elastic provision of some sort in every customs tariff. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> like myself, feels that the underlying principle is wrong; but it can be eliminated onlyup to a certain point. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes does not draw a distinction between the tools specified in sub-items a and b, notwithstanding /the fact that the Tariff Board, which examined the position quite recently, has spoken in no uncertain voice concerning those in sub-item a.

                        <para>Owing to the nature of the tools now in question, the overseas freight on them is relatively low. The local manufacturers do not, therefore, enjoy such a high measure of natural protection as is enjoyed by the manufacturers of other tools dealt with herein. While the board can see no justification for increasing the duty on stocks, dies and taps to the extent proposed in Tariff Resolutions of 19th June, 1930, and 26th March, 1931, it considers that in order to safeguard the local industry against the possibility of detrimental competition from the continental tools already referred to herein, some increase in the rates provided in the Customs Tariff,1921-1930 is justified. It is considered that, having regard to the relative quality of the locally-made and continental tools, rates of 45 per cent. British preferential tariff, 55 per cent, intermediate tariff, and 60 per cent. general tariff should be sufficient. Such rates are accordingly recommended in respect of all screwing tools other than those coming within the definition of machinery. </para>

I cannot carry the matter further than to say that my promise, that there would be a further dissection, is being fulfilled. The honorable senator's method is a haphazard one. What chance would there be of recasting the item by the time that the House of Representatives had to deal with it, seeing that three or four months were occupied on the other task to which I have referred, which was comparatively simple ? </para>

                            <para>- I would sooner it took a little time, than that any injustice should be done. The reference of the matter to the Tariff Board, where any doubt exists, is consistent with the policy that has been adopted throughout. I do not say that because an individual professes capability to manufacture a certain article, the Tariff Board should necessarily inquire into the project. Hundreds of items that are now admitted under by-law can be included in the tariff almost immediately; hut there is a number of others, some of which may fall under sub-item a or sub-item b, in respect of which such a course cannot be adopted, and it is those that we desire to safeguard. I ask honorable senators to reject the request. </para>

                        <para>. - The Minister has made out a very reasonable case for the -refusal of the committee to settle this matter by what may be termed a block vote. My name has been mentioned in this debate, and I wish to make it plain that I do not desire the free admission of tools that can readily be made in this country at a reasonable price. The tools that I referred to, and which the Minister assured me last night are on the free list, can be manufactured only at considerable outlay, and by the continuous application of skill. In addition, they are tools for which the market is not sufficiently large to demand factory production in this country; that is to say, they cannot be produced economically. Only on that ground would I press for their free admission. That is in conformity with the sentiment that the reform which the Minister has foreshadowed should be effected, namely, that as far as possible, the articles now admitted under by-law should be incorporated in the tariff, so that Parliament may have control over them in the future. But I should like the Minister to make it clear that these incorporations will be continuous. </para>

                            <para>- It is amazing that some of the tools that have been mentioned in this debate are not made in Australia. Tools may be divided into two classes, those of a simple nature, such as mattocks or picks, and those whose manufacture requires great skill, for instance, saws. While I do not profess to be a blacksmith, I could, if given the material, make a mattock, which, while not being elegant in workmanship, would do effectively the job required of it. It should not require elaborate machinery or a great deal of organizing skill to establish a factory to manufacture simple tools such as wedges or picks. I realize that the making of cross-cut, tenon, panel, hand, or rip saws is quite a different matter, requiring a well-equipped and up-to-date factory, and a large market to enable mass production to be undertaken, otherwise the cost would be prohibitive. Though our industrial system is not yet. extensive enough to warrant the establishment of a factory to manufacture saws, simple tools such as crow-bars, wedges, and mauls, could easily be manufactured in Australia in sufficient quantities to satisfy local requirements. While I favour a reasonable duty on imported tools, I consider that every encouragement should be given to local industry to manufacture tools of a simple pattern, which are extensively used. I know that an Australian patented a shovel that was peculiarly adapted for the coal-mining industry, but long-handled shovels are not yet made in Australia, and they are expensive to purchase. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not understand the need for sub-item a. After all, screwing tools represent only one class of implement used by artisans and  mechanics,  numerous other varieties being covered by sub-item3 n and c. However, as the item .is set out, there may be some- justification for the recommendation of the Tariff Board, although the duties appear to be high. </para>

                    <para>I cannot follow the reasoning either of the Government or of the Tariff Board in connexion with sub-item b, which provides ad valorem duties, British, 35 per cent. ; and general, 55 per cent., on hand tools wholly or principally of metal, n.e.i. Who is to decide whether a tool is wholly or partly made of metal ? </para>

                        <para>. - The important issue that has been raised by this discussion, and has been dealt with in part by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.-</inline> B Hayes, draws attention to a rather full discussion of the whole subject of by-laws which is incorporated in the report of the Tariff Board of the 14th October, 1932, dealing with machines and machinery, n.e.i. The opinions that were then expressed are largely applicable to the item that we are now discussing, and as the report qualifies several points that have been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> perhaps I may be allowed briefly to quote from it. The following extract is taken from page 7: - </para>

                        <para>During the current year, the. board has held several inquiries into the question of duty on various classes of machinery, and a.t nearly every one of these inquiries, the matter of the administration of the by-law provisions of tariff item 174 has been the subject of criticism by witnesses. The board is impressed with the need for a serious alteration in the existing procedure; and considers that some method should be evolved which will impose the least possible burden on purchasers of equipment absolutely necessary for the economic development of Australian industries, and which will at the same time provide proper protection to local machinery manufacturers against the importation of the large and varied range of machines and appliances that are being well made in Australia and sold at reasonable prices.' </para>
                        <para>The board found that the consideration of all such requests took up a great deal of its time, and recommended that the Tariff Board Act be so amended that it would be optional with the Minister too refer such requests instead of obligatory. The act was so amended in 1029, and during the last three years, only three questions regarding the admission of goods under by-laws have been dealt with by the board, compared with an average of over 700 per annum in the three years prior to 1920. </para>

                            <para>- I agree. I said last night that it is throwing an altogether unfair responsibility on the Minister, and a tremendous lot of work, some of it unnecessary, on his officers. One of the recommendations of the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes is that, instead of putting these officers to the trouble of working for 40 years to clarify the position, the matter can be immediately adjusted by a vote in this chamber and elsewhere. </para>

The same spirit of fairness has not, unfortunately, been characteristic of the applicants for by-law concessions, nor of the interests opposing the concessions. In its annual report tor the year ended 30th June, 1928, the Tariff Board, in referring to some requests, stated - </para>
                        <para>Cases not infrequently come before the board in which Australian manufacturers, without, in the opinion of the board, any justification, seek admission under bylaw at concessional rates of duty of plant or materials which other Australian manufacturers are quite capable of satisfactorily supplying on a commercial basis, and, in some instances, at a lower price than that of the imported article. </para>

                        <para>The position as regards machines and appliances the subject of temporary by-laws, is much more difficult, and the board has evidence that the present system is viewed with disfavour both by local machinery manufacturers and importers. It is recognized that frivolous requests for by-law exemptions have, from time to time, been made by users of machinery, and also that frivolous objections have been raised to the by-law exemption of certain machines not commercially producible in Australia. But ignoring these cases, the board has found that, in many instances, complaints from either one or both sides have been justified. . . . The board considers that the continuance of the practice of issuing temporary or " one-day " by-laws for the exemption of certain machines from duty is unavoidable, but that the necessity for such special by-laws will be diminished if the permanent by-law list is increased. </para>

                        <para>The exemption of such machines from full duty would involve some loss of revenue, but the need for lower costs of production in Australia is so vital to the progress of our secondary industries and the re-employment of dismissed workers that, in the opinion of the board, the revenue aspect should be disregarded when requests for admission of machines under by-laws are being considered. One serious objection to the present method of dealing with applications for by-law exemptions is that the question whether a machine of Australian manufacture is comparable with the imported article may be decided by persons who have not the necessary technical knowledge. While in many instances the decision may present little difficulty there are numerous cases to the contrary. </para>

Upon making inquiries, the second man was tolddisrinctly that, if he advanced a certain sum of money, the business would be arranged. He had always carried on his business honestly, and now he was in a quandary. He took two or three days to consider the matter, but, as his competitor was selling the goods on the market, and he himself would be ruined if he were unable to do the same, he paid the money asked, andhisconsignment was admitted. I do not know whether this was done under a by-law or not, but I know that it was done, and I have been given to understand that this was not an isolated case. In this instance, an honest trader was driven to do something he had never done before. The incident did not occur during the present administration. </para>

                    <para>I should not have risen now but for the very serious statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> has just made. I have known SenatorReid for a. great part of my life, and I feel sure that he would not make a statement of that kind in this chamber if he had the slightest doubt as to its truth. I am convinced that he himself believed it to be true. SenatorReid should go a little further. The fact that the incident did not take place during the life of the present Administration does not matter. Whatever government was in power at the time, we can, I think, take it for granted that the Government knew nothing of it. The customs administration goes on all the time, no matter what government is in power. For twenty years, in the capacity of a customs clerk, I had an intimate acquaintance with customs work. While acting on behalf of my employers, I came up against some extremely difficult and intricate problems, but never once did I see any attempt to solve them by any means other than referring them for decision to the unbiased and expert officials whose work it was to make determinations. </para>
                    <para>I was pleased to hear the Minister's statement that, in future, the use of by-law admission would be minimized, and that articles which hitherto have been so admitted would, as far as possible, be placed on the permanent tariff. </para>

I said that I was not making a general charge against customs officials, but that, if there was a black sheep among them, he might defame them all. If I knew the officer against whom the allegation might lie, I would let the Minister know, but I did not make inquiries. </para>

I had considerable experience in clearing goods through the customs in my earlier years, and I know how exceedingly difficult is the work of departmental officers who, in my opinion, are highly efficient. In Brisbane, I knew the personnel of the department for about 'twenty years, and I fully appreciated their difficulties. Although, in some cases, there were annoying delays, the fault could not wholly be attributed to departmental officers. During the whole of my dealings with the department, I never heard anything of the nature mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> this morning. </para>

                        <para>. - I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes to say, in an interjection, that no matter what arguments the Minister might advance, he and those who are supporting his requested amendment are determined to bring about a reduction of the duties. Personally, I do not think that is quite fair. We should decide all these matters on principles of right and justice. In the earlier part of my life I worked as an engineer's pattern-maker using tools of every description, and whenever we applied for an award we always took into account the cost of our tools of trade. I understand that, in the various States, members of the carpenters union or other industrial organizationswho use tools, always include in their claims before the court the cost of the tools used by them with a view to getting a slightly higher award to offset the cost of tools. There has been a certain amount of sentimental talk during this tariff discussion about the interests of farmers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes has urged that fern hooks, mattocks, grubbers and other similar implements, being the farmers' tools of trade, should be admitted duty free. He might, with equal force, argue that tractors and heavy farm machinery are also primary producers' tools of trade, and should also be admitted free. Then, carrying the argument a little further, he might plead for the free admission of raw materials required in secondary industries that manufacture farm implements. The honorable senator's contention reminds me of the reasoning employed by a man who, as the result of several matrimonial adventures in which he failed to observe the law of consanguinity, was able to prove that he was his own grandfather. We on this side support protection, not because of our regard for manufacturers, but because we believe it is essential, and in the best interests of the Commonwealth, to encourage the extension of Australian industries which give employment to Australian workmen. Therefore, we contend that, if tools of trade are being manufactured in Australia at a reasonable cost, the industry engaged in making them should have adequate protection. Personally, in order to encourage Australian industries, I have always been prepared to pay a little more, not only for tools of trade, but for . any other requirement that is made in Australia. Only by a general observance of this rule can we hope to become independent of overseas sources and unaffected by those periodical crises which work great havoc in other countries. With regard to the statement made by SenatorReid, 1 am glad to know that the Minister has said that an inquiry will be made. The statement was grossly unfair to officials of the Trade and Customs Department. </para>

                    <para class="block">Rabbit traps were inquired into by the Tariff Board in December last. Three firms operating in the neighbourhood of Sydney applied for an increase of duties, and the application was opposed by, amongst others, a representative of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, the Graziers Association of New South Wales, the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales, the Producers Advisory Council, the Fruit-growers Federation of New South Wales, and theRetail Traders . Association of New South Wales. The board recommended an increase of duties. Although two of the three applicant firms commenced manufacturing only since 1929, the board made no reference to the number of persons employed in the industry;, therefore, one may assume that the number is not large. These duties have increased with the years. Up to 1921, the rates were - British free, general 10 , per cent. ; from 1921 onwards, 20 per cent., 25 per cent., and 30 per cent. ; and from. 1929 onwards, 45 per cent. 55 per cent., and 60 per cent., or 10s., 15s., 15s. a dozen. The Tariff Board in its last report recommended duties of 45 per cent. and 65 per cent., but particularly emphasized that there was no need to continue the alternative specific duties. I ask the Minister to explain why, despite that recommendation, an alternative fixed rate of 5s. is imposed in the schedule. The evidence showed that the bulk of the English traps being manually forged instead of machine-made are heavier than the Australian, and therefore more substantial. The representative of one of the English manufacturers mentioned that the firm's only markets were </para>

            <para>A feature of the New South Wales Government's re-employment scheme in the past year has been its efforts to assist men out of jobs to turn a pest - the rabbits - to profit. </para>
            <para>Up to May 31 last, 12,000,000 rabbit carcases, estimated to be worth more than £300,000, and 5,000,000 lb. of rabbit-skins, valued at £218,000 were exported from the State. </para>
            <para>The Government assisted trappers to purchase equipment and now in many country centres, owing to the trapping, there are no unemployed, while in others numbers have been materially reduced. </para>
            <para class="block">A large number' of men who have been out of work and in receipt of the dole have been able to obtain temporary employment trapping rabbits. In many districts of Australia the same thing is going on. I myself have lent rabbit traps to men who had not sufficient traps of their own. Notwithstanding the shortage of rabbit traps, there is this ridiculously high tariff, which prevents unemployed men, in receipt of the dole, from obtaining healthy employment, and, at the same time, from assisting to keep down a pest which has caused agriculturists and  pastoralists severe losses. On those two scores alone, there is ample justification for a substantial reduction of the duties. One witness before the Tariff Board said that his company carried sufficient stocks to meet . a sudden demand. It would appear that witnesses are in the habit of saying such things. If ample supplies of rabbit traps were available, why were the manufacturers asked to speed up production? Another Australian witness suggested that the British preferential duty should be 45 per cent., with a general tariff 'rate in accordance with the Ottawa agreement. Apparently, that witness would interpret the Ottawa agreement by making the duty on British goods as high as possible, with a still higher duty on foreign goods. If we are to apply the principle underlying the Ottawa agreement in one case, we should apply it to all the items in the schedule. The following statement in the Tariff Board's report, which was issued after the termination of the Ottawa Conference, appears to be a breach of the agreement made at Ottawa. v </para>
            <para>The fact that Australian manufacturers secured only 40 per cent, to 50 per cent, of the market prior to 1929 indicates that the rates of duty provided under the Customs Tariff 1921-30, viz., 20 per cent. British preferential tariff, and 30 per cent, general tariff, were not adequate to enable them to take full advantage of the market open to them. </para>

            <para>The machinery for putting that undertaking into operation is referred to in article 11. According to the Tariff Board, the old rates of duty were sufficient to secure to Australian manufacturers only from 40 per cent, to 50 per cent, of the market, and, therefore, it recommended practically a prohibitive measure of protection. </para>

                        <para>- It was impossible to do that in the case of rabbit traps where there is no alternative fixed rate in the British column. Just as we had to add the margin in the case of the ad valorem duties, so we had to maintain the old margin of 5s. on the fixed rates. There is, therefore, an alternative flat rate of 5s. in the general column, but no fixed rate in the British column. The proposed rates represent an increase of British, 25 per cent., and general, 35 per cent., or 5s. a dozen, on the 1921-30 tariff rates. Compared with the Scullin duties, they are lower by 10s. a dozen in the case of the specific rate under the British preferential tariff, but are 5 per cent, higher in the ad valorem rate under the general tariff. The ad valorem rates new proposed are based on the recommendation of the Tariff Board; but the fixed rate margin of 5s. a dozen, which was in existence at the time that the </para>

                <para class="block">Ottawa agreement was signed, has been maintained. This industry is one peculiarly suited to Australia. Evidence given before the Tariff Board shows that Australia, and New Zealand are practically the only markets in the world for rabbit traps. Local manufacturers are manufacturing efficiently, both wire spring and flat spring traps, and are capable of supplying the whole requirements of trappers. The raw material used is mainly Australian, and, consequently, the manufacture of rabbit traps in Australia provides indirect employment in other industries. For the year 192S-29, which was the year immediately preceding the imposition of the increased duties, 60 per cent. of the importations were purchased from the United States of America. , The principal American trap was the " Victor," which was then landing at 19s. 6d. per dozen. These traps are now being manufactured in Australia under licence, and the Australian manufacturers' net price to-day is 15s. 7½d. c.i.f. main Australian ports, which is only 5d. per dozen more than the landed cost of the American trap to-day without duty, primage or exchange. </para>

                        <para>- The trade has developed with the United States of America rather than with the United Kingdom, which is not surprising, because the class of trap manufactured in the United Kingdom is too light for Australian conditions. </para>

                <para>It will, therefore, be seen that, not only is the farmer or trapper able to purchase his traps to-day at a much lower price than he could prior to the imposition of the higher duties, but under present exchange conditions he is also benefited considerably by reason of local manufacture. The British manufacturers supply light and heavy traps. The light trap is sold at a much lower price than the heavier trap, and the duty necessary to bring this in line with the Australian price under normal exchange would be approximately 53 per cent. However, this trap represented only from 15 per cent. to 20 per cent. of the British traps imported. The other British traps are high-priced, and, when considering the Tariff Board's report, the Government was notquite satisfied that the duties recommended by the board gave British manufacturers an opportunity of reasonable competition in accordance with article 10 of the United Kingdom and Australia trade agreement. The Tariff Board was accordingly requested to state its views on this aspect, and has replied that any lower duty would have the effect of increasing importations of the lighter trap to the detriment of the local industry. The whole of the facts placed before the Tariff Board, particularly in respect to reductions of prices, efficiency of local manufacturers, and ability of local manufacturers to supply all requirements with traps equal to any imported, shows that this industry is one which deserves every encouragement. I understand that prices are being maintained at a low level. The Tariff Board summarizes the position as follows :  - </para>
                <para>Theboard fully realizes the importance of cheap and efficient rabbit traps, particularly in view of the existing menace of rabbit plague and the large amount of unemployment at present.

When I first read the report of the Tariff Board, I felt that, in recommending these duties, effect had not been given to the Ottawa agreement. This report was made before the board had any statutory reference with respect to the Ottawa agreement submitted to it, but, when the report was returned for further consideration, the board said that it gave effect to the decisions reached at Ottawa. This the Government also says. </para>

                    <para>. - As rabbit traps are used almost entirely by those engaged in pastoral and agricultural pursuits, they should be admitted free of duty. There are three classes of vermin traps listed in the tariff schedule, namely, dog traps, rabbit traps, and vermin traps of other kinds, which include mouse and rat traps. The duties on dog traps are British, free; general, 10 per cent. ; and on rabbit traps, British 45 per cent., and general, 65 per cent., or 5s. a dozen. Other vermin traps, such as rat and mouse traps, are admitted free. As usual the city-dweller has preference under the tariff; he can obtain a rat or a mouse trap free of duty, but the men in the country who use rabbit traps imported from Great Britain have to pay a duty of 45 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. But the employment of a few dozen men making rabbit traps does not warrant the Government placing an unnecessary burden upon those engaged in pastoral and agricultural industries, as proposed under this sub-item. It should be the endeavour of the Government to assist in ridding Australia of these pests rather than to keep a few men employed in an industry making traps which are sold at a price rabbit-catchers cannot afford to pay. I am advised that English rabbit traps  can be bought in England at, 7s. 6d. a dozen. Those engaged in rabbit-trapping, and in the pastoral industry, are entitled to obtain rabbit traps at the cheapest rate. I object to the preference that, in this instance, is being shoiwn to the city interests. If a duty is justified on rabbit traps, it should be justified on mouse, and rat traps which are used largely in the city, but under this tariff the city interests will gain an advantage at the expense of the country interests, particularly the grazing industry which is in urgent need of rabbit traps. </para>

If this duty can be said to offer to Great Britain an opportunity of reasonable competition what must we think of the efficiency of our industries? In view of the many charges on British importations, and the great distance of Great Britain from Australia, it is a direct reflection upon our industries if we cannot make the duty on rabbit traps lower than 45 per cent. Furthermore, is not the preponderence of American imports an indication to both Australia and Great Britain that they should make better traps? As every rabbiter knows, there is a tremendous variation in the quality of traps. The aim of Australia should be to manufacture the best article, and that, I understand, is not being done at present. </para>

With a foreign duty of 25 per cent., as is now proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes,</inline> the British manufacturer would be unable to compete with the manufacturer pf the United States of America. At first sight these duties do appear to be a violation of the Ottawa agreement. It was recognized that the duty of 45per cent. was a higher protection than was necessary against the heavier traps from Great Britain, but there is a lighter and cheaper trap being manufactured in the United Kingdom, and the Tariff Board's report indicates that the selling price to the trade of the Australian-made trap exceeds the landed cost, duty free, par exchange, of the light-weight 'trap by 53 per cent. This trap, although not equal in quality to the Australian-made trap, would be able to compete with it even after the imposition of the rates of duty recommended by the board. If the duty were made lower than that recommended by that body, competition would be unduly in favour of the imported article. Its report states - </para>

                    <para>While most of the demand in Australia is for the light type of trap, there still exists a certain though decreasing demand for the heaviertype manufactured in the United Kingdom, and in some cases a demand for the lighter United Kingdom type. The importation of such traps is rendered unduly costly by. the imposition of the proposed fixed-rate duties, which are equivalent to 73 per cent. on the f.o.b. cost of a heavy British trap previously in considerable demand, and as high as 117 per cent. on the British light-weight trap. In the opinion of the Tariff Board, the manufacture of rabbit traps in Australia would be adequately protected by ad valorem rates of 45 per cent. (British preferential tariff) and65 per cent. (general tariff) without the provision of alternative specific duties. </para>

What we do know is that rabbit traps should enter this country duty free from Great Britain. Australia is now experiencing the worst rabbit plague ever known in this country. </para>

                        <para>- Their use would check the progress of the rabbits towards the settled districts, and would enable thousands of unemployed to make a living. This menace has been increasing for many years. For the two years prior to the present drought, the seasons, even in the interior, were good, and the rabbits multiplied rapidly. As the drought set in, the rabbits naturally, as in all past plagues, followed the feed and the rainfall towards the coastal districts. Formerly, the pastoralists were able to combat this menace by using wire netting and employing many men ; but, owing to the fact that the federal land tax is a first charge on anything they have, they have not been able to maintain the staffs previously employed by them, and their wire netting fences have fallen into disrepair. This netting is very dear. I have inspected hundreds of miles of rabbit.netting fences' in inland parts of Australia, and they are now in a shocking state of disrepair. The rabbits are coming through, not in hundreds of thousands, but in millions. This year, the drought is terribly severe in the interior, and it will have a most detrimental effect upon production. Australia is, to a certain extent, suffering from what is known as a rabbit drought, because, in some districts, the pest has completely eaten out, not thousands, but probably millions of acres of feed, and has left the country as bare as a road. It has even devoured the salt bush. </para>

                        <para>- I am emphasizing the severity of the rabbit plague, because the people generally do not realize how great a contributing factor it is to the decrease of primary production this year. I want rabbit traps to be admitted from Great Britain free, so that they can be purchased as cheaply as possible in Australia. A trapper requires from eight to ten dozen traps. The price of the Australian-made traps is 15s.  7-Jd.  a dozen, c.i.f., main Australian ports; but the trapper probably has to pay twice as much as that, so it costs him a considerable sum for this equipment alone. </para>

                <para>I anticipate that the decrease in this year's Australian wool crop will not be less than 300,000 bales, and it may be 400,000 bales. This drop is attributable very largely to the rabbit plague. The wheat crops in the Wimmera and in the Victorian Mallee last year showed a falling off, owing to the high cost of wire netting and rabbit traps, which prevented the man on the land from equipping himself with the means of resisting this awful plague. Rabbit traps would be made cheaper by removing the British duty, and the Minister has said that there is a growing demand for British traps. The trapping of large numbers of rabbits would prevent the waste of wholesome human food and valuable fur. I have always regretted to see, as I frequently have, 50,000 or 100,000 rabbits slaughtered in a night by the poisoning of waterholes. Not even the skins of those rabbits were used. I know, that trapping is not the most efficient way of fighting this pest, but it is a very useful method to adopt in country townships. </para>
                <para class="block">Throughout Australia, at the present time, every town, large or small, unfortunately, has its unemployed, who might will be occupied in trapping rabbits. This would enable them to obtain a living, and, at the same time, they would be helping Australia to get rid of a serious menace. I should like to see traps given away to the unemployed. </para>

                        <para>- They would certainly be somewhat cheaper than they now are. If we imposed a high foreign tariff, and encouraged the purchase of British traps, a large trade could be built up with the Old Country. With the present price of rabbits, and, particularly, of rabbit skins, a trapper could make a reasonable living. It is better to give the unemployed a chance to engage in useful work than to have them loafing about the country townships, and, perhaps, living on the dole. I have enough respect for the majority of my fellow- Australians to believe that they would rather trap rabbits than live on charity. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> asks for a duty of only 25 per cent, against traps made in the United States of America. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister said that the Government is merely carrying out the Ottawa, agreement in raising the foreign duty; but why not reduce the British rate? Under the 1921-30 tariff, the British rate was only 20 per cent. Why has it been increased to 45 per cent.? That is not the way to implement the Ottawa agreement. The intention was to provide the margin by decreasing the duties against British goods. It is admitted by all that thousands of men are making, and thousands more could make, a decent living by the trapping of rabbits. "What is there to show on the other side of the ledger? There are three firms in Australia which make rabbit traps. We . are not told  how many persons they employ; probably the number is very few. Preference is to be given to these three firms, which possibly are established in Newcastle or some other spoon-fed district, to the detriment of the pastoral and agricultural industries, and the thousands of unemployed who could render a national service by destroying these rodents, and in the process make a living for themselves. I hope that the committee will agree to make the rate free British, and 40 per cent, general. </para>

I have had considerable experience in the trapping of rabbits, and know what is the best trap. If the inferior foreign traps, including the British traps, were dumped into this country, they would be a hindrance instead of a blessing to the trapper, because he might be induced to spend his last few shillings in purchasing them on account of their comparative cheapness, and subsequently have to scrap them. </para>

                        <para>- The traps of which I have knowledge are, "Sidebottom's," " Bellamy's," " Griffith's," and "Star and Crescent." The "Star and Crescent " is a good trap, and so was the " Griffith's " in my day. Honorable senators must agree tha-t, if there is any country in which good traps can be made,  it is one in which rabbits are plentiful, because the trapper knows what he requires. The factories which make these traps in Australia are up to date, and the price to-day is right compared with that which ruled under. free- trade conditions. The price of rabbit traps twenty years ago was as high as 18s. a dozen. Rabbits are trapped only when they are plentiful, and when the price received for them is regarded as favorable. There have been times when rabbits have disappeared, and there has been no use for the traps, which in many cases have found their way into second-hand shops, or have been returned to storekeepers from whom they were being bought on terms, to be released when the rabbits again became plentiful, and the price was sufficiently high to enable the trapper to make a living. If foreign manufacturers were allowed to dump 200,000 dozen or 300,000 dozen traps in Australia, it would be the " stone end " of the local industry. That is what we have to be careful to guard against. The normal requirements in the season are from 30,000 dozen to 40,000 dozen traps. 1 trust that the committee will reject the proposal to reduce the tariff. This is an Australian industry which has made good, and is capable of meeting the requirements of the trappers at a reasonable price. Irrespective of what the Ottawa agreement may provide, we should at all hazards protect the industries of this country. </para>

                    <para>. - The question to be decided by the committee is, not what is best for a few manufacturers or a few individuals, but what is best for Australia. I am not a novice in this matter, because I have had many years' experience in rabbit-infested districts. I have sold many gross of rabbit traps, and have helped to pack for export thousands of bales of skins. I know what the effect was on Tasmania when the price of traps was increased by 100 per cent. This matter was fully discussed in 1921, when this branch of the legislature, by a majority of 1, rejected the proposal to place a duty on British traps. At one time, the trapper could buy, for from 10s. 9d. to 13s. 6d. a dozen, the best British traps. "When the price went up to 24s. and 33s. a dozen, the rabbit pest immediately began to increase in Tasmania, because the trappers were men of small means. One portion of Tasmania which suffers severely from the rabbit pest is comprised of beautiful country, but being rough and rugged it is impossible to trap the rabbits in a wholesale way, as can be done in the mainland States. Recently, because those who are suited to this avocation found it impossible to buy traps, the municipal councils in this district were approached with the request that they provide the necessary capital to finance the purchase of a large quantity, which could be rented out or used by the unemployed, rent free, so that they might help to combat the pest. I. honestly believe that we are justified in doing anything to combat it. It is incorrect for honorable senators to say that the price of traps to-day is not prohibitive. It must not be forgotten that the expenditure of the trappers does not end when they have purchased their traps, because the loss of a certain number of traps is common. Many men must be shut out from this occupation because of the high, price of traps. I believe that if we carried the request, an immediate effect would be the reduction of the price of Australian traps. A trap of reasonably good quality could be made for much less than is being charged. I shall vote for the removal of the duty on British traps. I believe that if British rabbit traps are admitted free, the natural protection, plus exchange, primage and other charges, which amount to at least 45 per cent, ad valorem, is adequate to give our industry all the protection that it needs. </para>

                <para class="block">The report also says that traps manufactured in the United Kingdom and the United States of America are of a heavier material than those manufactured locally, being manually forged instead of machine made. All the evidence is to the effect that the heavier article is more suitable for rabbit-trapping, and that the " Star and Crescent" trap referred to by the Minister is used mainly for catching opossums. Until 1921, the rates of duty were, free British; and 10 per cent, foreign. If that was adequate protection, why is it suggested that the rates should now be British, 45 per cent., and foreign 65 per cent. ? </para>

That now asked is for men who are temporarily out of employment, who would prefer to do something rather than draw a dole from the Government. Surely this committee will not insist on granting such inordinately high protection merely to assist an indeterminate number of men who' are. employed by three firms in Sydney, in preference to giving work to a great number of unemployed, who would assist to exterminate one of our most pestiferous nuisances.

Under the Bruce-Page tariff the duty was 10 per cent, against Great Britain. It is beyond my comprehension that the Government should want to increase that duty to 45 per cent., the rate that was approved by the Scullin Government, particularly when rabbits are such a serious menace to the country, and thousands of men who are out of work would be only too pleased to earn a crust by catching these pests. If the excuse for this high duty is a desire to implement the Ottawa agreement, I am surprised that the Government should shelter behind such a flimsy subterfuge. </para>

                        <para>- The Government is doing its job very poorly indeed. It has not even indicated how many persons are employed by these, three firms, and it is neglecting an opportunity to give work to thousands of unemployed throughout Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - In the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun Pictorial</inline> of the 30th June, I am credited, with having said that Australian-made pipes were horrible to smoke. That statement is quite misleading. What I said, by way of interjection, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Brown</inline> was expatiating on the virtues of pipes made from Australian wood, was that, from my experience, they were horrible to smoke. I have tried pipes made of pretty well every variety of Australian wood, and, in my opinion, they are all horrible to smoke. But Australian-made pipes made from French bruyere wood are excellent to smoke. I know it, because I have tried them.I condemned, not Australian-made pipes as such, but Australian-made pipes made from Australian woods, which are not suitable for the making of pipes for smoking. </para>
