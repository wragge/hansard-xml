            <para>- (1) Has the Leader of the Government in the Senate read the newspaper reports of the speech made in Sydney on the 12th July, by the Prime Minister, under the auspices of the Sane Democracy League, wherein he is reported to have said that the Crimes Act would be invoked against communists or supposedly auxiliary organizations which advocated similar doctrines alleged to be subversive of constitutional institutions? (2) In view of that statement, what action has been taken by the Government against a body known as the New Guard in New South Wales, which, according to highlyplaced police officials of that State, is organized on military lines, and was fully prepared, prior to the last New South Wales general election, to capture Sydney by armed force, abolish the State Parliament, and 3et up a dictatorship in the event of a Labour victory? (3) Is he conversant with the cabled report that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Litvinoff,</inline> the Russian Commissar for Foreign Affairs in the Communist Government of that country, and delegate to the World Economic Conference, was recently a guest of  His  Majesty the King at a -royal reception in Buckingham Palace? (4) Is it also a fact that trade relations between the British Imperial Government and Soviet Russia have recently been resumed, and that trade relations between that country and Australia have operated continuously for several years, largely to the advantage of the Commonwealth? (5) In view of the foregoing, will the Government consider the advisability of confining its activities to practical methods of combating existing evils instead of creating mythical bogies for propaganda purposes? </para>

          <para class="block">The Commerce Trade Descriptions Act 1905-1930 gives authority for the carrying out of the inspection and examination of all prescribed goods which are submitted for export to destinations overseas. The goods which are at present inspected and examined by regulations made under that act include meat, butter, cheese and eggs, and fresh, dried, and canned fruits.  With  the exception of fresh fruits, the commodities prescribed are inspected by officers of the Department of Commerce, but in the case of fresh fruits the inspection i3 carried out by State officers acting for the Commonwealth. Occasionally, temporary inspectors are engaged by the Department of Commerce during rush periods. In the act as it stands " Officer " is defined as an officer of customs, and in relation to exports includes an officer of the Department of Commerce. The bill now before the Senate provides for the cancellation of the existing definition of " Officer ", which has been found to be inadequate, and for the substitution of a new definition of " Officer " to include any employee of the Department of Commerce or any officer of a State engaged in the work of inspection and examination of goods on behalf of the Commonwealth. This is purely a machinery measure, and will, no doubt, be approved by all honorable senators. </para>

            <para>. - From time to time, we read reports in the press regarding difficulties experienced in the marketing of Australian goods, particularly butter, in Great Britain. I should like to know if the Government is taking steps to see that some control is exercised over the disposal of graded Australian butter when it reaches the other side of the world. According to the press reports, it appears' that Australian butter is frequently mixed with inferior brands from other countries, and distributed throughout the United Kingdom, much to the discredit of the genuine Australian article. Steps should be taken to protect the interests of the Australian exporters. As the bill is of a non-contentious character, I offer it no opposition. </para>

              <para>- I think that the Government will admit that the customs tariff and the excise tariff are closelyrelated subjects, and the attitude of the Government to the customs duties must have a bearing on its attitude to excise duties. Under the customs tariff, there are  a  number of revenue items which involve the consideration of the same principles as those which ought to be weighed in connexion with the excise tariff. Therefore, I submit that it is competent for me, on the second reading of this bill, to refer to the allegation of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> that the Country party is adopting a policy entirely different from that upon which it was elected. According to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> the Prime Minister stated in his speech that there had been no whipping on the tariff, and that the members of the" ministerial party had voted as they individually thought proper. </para>

          </continue><para>No doubt, I shall be quite in order in discussing the duties on tobacco. This matter is looked upon by many persons in Australia  as  one of paramount importance. The present position of the industry is rather extraordinary, because it is evident, from past events, that the report of the Tariff  Board  was based,  not on deliberately false information, but on wrong premises. This was- recognized recently by the Prime Minister on his visit to Queensland. Tobacco leaf was grown in Australia more than 75 years ago. For the four years ended the 30th June, 1914, the average annual production of leaf was 2,300,000 lb. It will be seen that the production at that time was comparatively insignificant. Practically no expansion of the industry was noted until a few years ago; and we may well ask the reason for the phenomenal expansion that has taken place since 1929. The average annual production for the 10 years ended the 30th June, 1929, was slightly under 2,000,000 lb., as against the total requirement of 23,000,000 lb. per annum. During that period, the tobacco-growers in Australia were protected by a duty under the customs tariff amounting to about 2s. per lb. An attempt has been made by that section of the Senate which represents the Labour party to raise the import duty to 5s. 2d. per lb. I refuse to agree to that  proposal  as I believe in the scaling down of the fiscal wall. I propose to refer to the increases that have been made since the 22nd August, 1929, in the duty imposed under the customs tariff on unmanufactured tobacco entered to be locally manufactured into tobacco or cigarettes. These increases, although only proposals, and subject to ratification by Parliament, actually operated. The collection of duties under the various tariff resolutions has been validated up to and including the 29th February, 1932. The first resolution under the Customs Tariff 1921-28, which was tabled on the 22nd August, 1929, provided for a duty of 2s. per lb. Up to the 22nd of October, 1929, the duty was 2s. 5d. per lb. On the 21st November, 1929, it was increased to 3s. Until then, there had been no phenomenal expansion of the tobacco industry, as is shown in the Tariff Board report. On the 9th of July, 1930, the duty was increased to 3s. 6d. per lb., and on the 3rd of December, 1930, to 5s. 2d. per lb. During the two years from 1929 onwards, there was a great expansion of the tobacco growing industry. If this expansion was due to the high duties, there is surely a moral obligation on the Government to protect the interests of the thousands of growers who entered the industry as a result of the encouragement offered. When the present Government came into office, it acted on a Tariff Board report recommending the reduction of the import duty from 5s. 2d. to 3s. per lb. I do not object to the duty being reduced, because I 'believe that high duties are uneconomic, and the ultimate effect of the higher duty would have been to raise the price of Australian tobacco. The mistake was made in increasing the excise duty on manufactured tobacco at the same time. Before the alteration of the Scullin tariff, the excise duty on all tobacco manufactured in Australia was 2s. 4d. per lb., and it has now been increased to 4s. 6d. Under tha Scullin Government, the duty on imported tobacco was 5s. 2d. per lb., and the excise duty on tobacco manufactured in Australia was 2s. 4d. per lb., which brought the total charges on foreign tobacco up to 7s. 6d. per lb. When the present Government came into office, it reduced the duty on imported tobacco to 3s. per lb., and increased the excise on tobacco manufactured in Australia to 4s. 6d. Therefore, the total impost on foreign tobacco was still 7s. 6d. per lb.; but the excise duty on Australian tobacco was increased from 2s. 4d. to 4s. 6d., an increase of 93 per cent. What chance has the local" industry of holding its own against foreign competition when such a crushing burden is laid upon it? When the duty on imported tobacco was increased to 5s. 2d. per lb., the industry expanded in Australia, with the result that the number of growers increased from 660 to 4,764; so that the duties closely affect the livelihood of 4,764 families. The new growers, for the most part, were not experienced men; many of them were men who had lost their employment owing to the depression, and, with the few pounds left to them, were trying to make a living by growing tobacco. They have built up an equity in their property, and have accumulated knowledge about the cultivation and curing of tobacco leaf. Now those assets are jeopardized by the policy of the Government, because local production must inevitably be discouraged by the heavy increase of the excise duty. </para><para class="block">The cash value of the Australian tobacco crop last year was £1,250,000, as compared with £92,000 for the previous year. It is surely to our advantage to develop an industry when it means that our importations from the United States of America will be correspondingly reduced. Most of the tobacco we import comes from the United States of America, a country with which we already have a heavy adverse trade balance. In Australian currency, our imports from the United States of America in 1929-30 were valued at £30,316,208, and our exports to that country at £5,233,772. In 1930-31, imports were valued at £12,867,833, and exports at £2,291,157. In the folio- lug year, the last for which figures are available, we: imported from the United States of America goods to the value of £8,966,579, and exported to that country goods valued at £4,096,410. The apparent increase in the volume of exports to the United States of America for 1931-32 was due V» the depreciation of Australian currency as compared with American currency. Our adverse trade balance with the United States of America over the last three years totals no less than £39,889,281. Even now we are growing only a small part of the tobacco consumed in Australia, and there is plenty of room for further expansion. Nevertheless, the Government, by its policy, has pronounced a sentence of death on the industry. </para><para>One of the outstanding features pf the Tariff Board's report is the fear, expressed that the tobacco-growing industry may become so profitable that there will bo a rush of new growers to the industry, resulting in over-production. The Board, however, failed to take into consideration the uncertain nature of the crop. According to figures prepared by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the average crop for the last ten years has been 3,000,000 lb. Foi the last three years the average crop has been 6,000,000 lb., whereas last year's crop, on which the Tariff Board based its calculations, was 12,000,000 lb. Are honorable senators prepared to have the industry relapse into the condition obtaining in 1914? Now let us consider the coming crop: According to returns prepared by the department, the Tasmanian crop in 1932 was fair, but in 1933, though the area under cultivation was greater, a large part of the crop was lost through blue mould. In Western Australia there was a fair crop in 1932, but this year the yield has been greatly reduced owing to seasonal conditions. The Victorian crop last year was 4,500,000 lb., but this year it will not exceed 2,000,000 lb. owing to frost and mould. There was a good crop in New South Wale3 in 1932, but this year half the crop has been lost as a result of heavy frosts at Tumut and hailstorms at Tamworth. In Queensland, the 1932 crop amounted to 2,750,000 lb., while the 1933 crop will be smaller by at least 500,000 lb. The total crop for this year is estimated to be not more than 6,000,000 lb., which is only half the amount produced last year; yet thu growers are to be penalized by having the excise duty increased, by 93 per cent. No industry could survive that. I heard the Minister say the other day that it was the policy of the Government to encourage the tobacco industry, so that it would supply most of the leaf consumed in Australia. He spoke with pride of the assistance rendered to the local industry by the Council for Scientific and Industrial research, and the BritishAustralasian Tobacco Company, which had granted a subsidy for tobacco investigation. How, then, does he justify the Government's excise policy? Tobaccogrowers do not work under a 44-hour week award, but rise at dawn, and, in many instances, do not retire until midnight. Tobacco-growing is infinitely more arduous than dairying, because those engaged in it have no time for recreation or relaxation of any kind. </para><interjection>

              <para>- That is so. I realize that the proposal which I intend to submit will be attacked by the Minister in charge of the bill on the ground that, if adopted, the revenue would be seriously 'affected. Although the surplus for the last financial year has been given as £3,500,000, the Government still says that it cannot reduce excise duties owing to revenue considerations. How does it know how to estimate its revenue for the present financial year? Quite recently it was stated that the Government could not finalize the budget until the World Economic Conference now sitting in London had concluded its deliberations. The Government admits that, in the circumstances now prevailing, it cannot calculate its actual expenditure for the present financial year, because it does not know how much to allocate for exchange, or for numerous other liabilities. In view of that decision, how can the Minister say that it is necessary to preserve revenue at the highwater mark to which the tobacco industry has brought it in the past financial year? The Government does not know what its expenditure will be. To attempt to forecast it is to work in the dark. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>The next important point which I wish to discuss is the amount of revenue which the Government is entitled to extract from the tobacco industry. If any industry in Australia contributes to Commonwealth taxation, its possibilities of expansion have a very important bearing on the revenue. That is of particular importance in this instance. In dealing with the revenue aspect of the subject, the Tariff Board stated - </para><quote>
            <para>Having regard to all the circumstances, the Tariff Board is of the opinion that it -would be unwise, during the period in which the Australian leaf-growing industry is becoming established, to seek to increase the net revenue derived from tobacco beyond the amount raised during 1929-30, namely, approximately £0,500,000. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">The Tariff Board definitely stated that the tobacco-growing industry should not be discouraged, and that until it was firmly established the Government should not collect from it more than £6,500,000 in revenue. What has the Government taken from this industry, and has it observed the recommendations of the Tariff Board? If it has extracted more than the board recommends, the assumption is reasonable that it is responsible for discouraging the industry. </para><interjection>

              <para>- The 3rd February, 1932. The average revenue collected from the tobacco industry over a period of eleven years was £5,500,000. In 1930-31 it was £6,500,000, which is the figure at which the Tariff Board said that it should remain until the industry was on a firm basis. In 1931-32, the amount collected increased from £6,500,000 in the previous year to £7,150,000, and in 1932-33 it was £7,312,988. The figures for the last year were made up by customs duties of £2,561,445 and excise duties of £4,751,543. On a percentage basis, it will be seen that the Government is collecting an unduly large proportion of its revenue from the tobacco industry in the form of excise and customs duties. Taking the revenue figures from 1921-22 - in that period the revenue was only £4,908,683, to the present day, we find that . the special taxation which the Government ha3 imposed upon the industry has increased by 50 per cent. In view of the Tariff Board's recommendation that the amount raised by excise should not exceed £6,500,000, can the Government justify its action? If the tobacco consumption remained as at present, we could assume that this burden is pressing unduly upon the people, but consumption has not remained stationary. For the same period, the consumption of tobacco dropped by 13 per cent., while the revenue collected increased by 50 per cent. The Government is therefore collecting in excise £750,000 more than the Tariff Board recommended as a fair amount. It is impossible for the industry to carry on profitably under these conditions. I have copies of the figures which I have carefully prepared, which I shall be willing to supply to any honorable senator interested in the subject. My figures are based on an Australian crop of 6,000,000" lb. for this year. I have not attempted to estimate the revenue from this source for next year or for the following year, but have estimated on a 6,000,000-lb. crop for this year. On these figures, the total amount of revenue which the Government will secure is £6,661,764. In committee, I propose to move for the imposition of differential rates of excise on Australian and imported tobacco. I submit the following statement showing differential rates of excise duty, with the object of tobacco based on an estimated Australian encouraging the growing of Australian crop of 6,000,000 lb. : - </para>

          </para><para class="block">I know that the Minister will say that it would be difficult to administer such a scheme; but I shall show him how it can be effectively policed, and how, if adopted, would be of great benefit to Australian tobacco-growers. I am willing to supply the Minister with a copy of the table which I have just quoted, and I shall be glad if he can show me where it. is wrong, assuming, of course, that it is not the desire of the Government to extract more than £6,500,000 from the industry. If it is the desire of the Government to collect an exorbitant amount of revenue from this source it should say so, otherwise it will not be able to justify its action. If, for the reasons I have mentioned, the Government cannot calculate its. expenditure, bow can it estimate the additional revenue to be received from the tobacco industry? Doubtless it will be contended that it is udt possible successfully to police the proposal which 1 have outlined with regard to the excise duties; but to make the position clear, I remind the committee that the investigation of the industry in 1932 was not the first that had been made. In 1927, the Tariff Board conducted an inquiry into it, and recommended that assistance be given to the Australian growers by means of a preferential excise duty. It is reasonable to assume that, prior to making its recommendations, the board had considered carefully any difficulty that might arise from effect being given to its proposal, and was thoroughly satisfied that a preferential excise rate could be policed effectively. It had before it alternative requests, namely, the payment of a bounty at the rate of 6d. per lb. on all marketable tobacco leaf grown in Australia, or a reduction of the excise duty on tobacco manufactured from leaf grown it Australia as against imported leaf, and came to this conclusion : - </para><quote>
            <para>As regards the matter of reduction- of exciseduty, the main grounds advanced were that such reduction would enable tobacco manufacturers to pay growers higher prices for the leaf, and also to place tobacco manufactured from, or containing a proportion of, Australian leaf on the market at lower prices than those charged for tobacco made from imported leaf. </para>
          </quote><para>After careful consideration had been given by the board to the requests in the light both of evidence tendered and of the information gained from other sources, the board reported - </para><quote>
            <para>The board is of the opinion that the most satisfactory method would be by reducing the excise, with a special provision that any excise reduction be passed on to the grower. </para>
          </quote><para>As I have observed, we may reasonably assume that the board had thoroughly investigated every possible difficulty that might 'be encountered by the Customs Department in policing the differential excise duty, and had satisfied itself that it could be administered. But, apparently, the government of the day gave heed to the representations of the manufacturers who had urged that to impose different excise duties would create difficulties for them. I admit that it would involve a certain amount of confusion ; but we have to remember that the interests of 4,000 growers are at stake. Therefore, we should do that which lies in our power to give them a reasonable chance of getting some return on their capital. Though there may be no legal obligation on the Government to assist our growers, there is certainly a moral obligation to do so, because so many of these men engaged in the industry in the full belief that governmental action to assist it would be reasonably stable. Now, unhappily, a considerable number are threatened with complete extinction. </para><para>On a -former occasion when these duties were under consideration in the Senate, I moved that this item be postponed for further consideration, after a complete investigation of the industry had been made. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> now admits that the tobacco-growers of Australia did not have full opportunity to present their case to the board. This admission was made 'by the right honorable gentleman during his recent visit to Queensland. In reply to a deputation at Mareeba, he said that there would be a further independent inquiry into the industry in that district. I do not wish to question the fairness of the Prime Minister in promising an investigation of the Mareeba position; but I should like to know why it is to be limited to one particular area. Why should it not also include Tumut, Tamworth, and the tobacco-growing districts in northern Victoria? Why should the promised investigation be restricted to the Mareeba district? Are we to infer that the right honorable gentleman's promise is in the nature of a political sop to the tobacco growers in that area ? </para><continue><talk.start>

            <para>If what was said were true, it seemed to him that there was only one thing to do. It was right that the board should investigate the question on the spot in order to get at the facts connected with the industry. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">Let me now recapitulate my arguments. I have shown (1) that an import duty of 5s. 2d. was imposed by the Scullin Government, and that, as a result of the encouragement thus given, the number of tobacco-growers in Australia increased from 600 to over 4,000; (2) that the production of leaf last year amounted to 12,000,000 lb., and that this season's production will be in the vicinity of about 6,000,000 lb.; (3) that, although the Tariff Board has expressed the opinion that the' revenue from tobacco duties should not exceed £6,500,000, the Government's proposals will increase the revenue to £7,360,000, representing an increase of 50 per cent over the figures for 1931; (4) that a preferential excise duty of 3s. per lb. on tobacco manufactured from Australian leaf, as recommended by the Tariff Board in 1927, will produce a revenue of approximately £6,500,000; and give to the industry the protection it requires. Finally, I have shown that even the Prime Minister himself has admitted that the Tariff Board did not give tobacco growers an adequate opportunity to present their case. Why should this section of our primary producers be denied a fighting chance to succeed? If the Government adheres to its present intention with regard to these duties, it will deal a death blow to the tobacco-growing industry in Australia, and it is my intention, at the proper time, to take whatever action is possible in this chamber to save the industry. If I, and those who support me in this matter, are unsuccessful, there will be only one course to pursue, and that is to go to the tobacco-growing districts and tell the people concerned precisely what has been done in this chamber. If the Government does not accept proposals which we intend to put before the committee at a later stage, the only conclusion we can come to' is it does not desire to see this important Australian primary industry expand, and the people engaged in it prosper. </para></speech>

            <para>.- Desiring to get away from the smoky atmosphere associated with tobacco duties, I invite honorable senators to give consideration to the Government's proposals concerning beer. The brewing industry is of paramount importance, considered from the point of view of revenue. Within the last few days we have been told that the anticipated surplus for the year will be about £3,500,000, and that it is the intention of the Government to give relief from taxation to certain sections of the people. Surely it is time that the consumers, including those who have a predilection for liquid refreshment, had some consideration. The brewing industry in Australia is a very important one, having extremely wide ramifications. It is of considerable importance, as it provides employment and revenue. A great number of hands is directly employed in it, including skilled tradesmen in various branches of engineering, coopers, motor drivers and others. The business employs an extensive administrative and selling staff. A great deal of employment is also given in secondary and allied trades, such as in the manufacture of bottles, the use of timber, and the manufacture of barrels, cases and crates, crown corks, printing for advertising and labels, motor and horse-drawn vehicles and their equipment, the provision of coal and electricity, and the manufacture of machinery and plant. In addition, there are associated with the industry many primary industries that grow the raw materials used in the production of beer, such as barley, hops, sugar, straw for envelopes, and other materials. In view of the fact that primary production is at a very low ebb in Australia to-day, some relief should be given to this industry. Any assistance that it receives would react to the benefit of those who are engaged in the hop, timber, and sugar industries. In committee, I shall move that the House of Representatives be requested to make  the duties, sub-items a and b, ls. 4d. a gallon. I am confident that any revenue lost by the reduction of 8d. a gallon would be made good by the greater demand caused by the lowering of the price of beer, an undertaking to lower it having been given by the brewers. The excise duty has been increased by 700 per cent, since 1914, and now amounts to 3d. a pint. </para>

              <para>- If they did not, the Queensland sugar industry, which is strongly protected, would suffer. I have no wish to parade my virtues, but all my life I have been a total abstainer from liquor and tobacco. I am asking for this relief, not as a prohibitionist, but as one who wishes to help the industry. Beer is 100 per cent. Australian-made. The high taxation imposed is having an injurious effect on several industries, including the sugar and hop industries. Hops are .grown in Tasmania, and in the Goulburn Valley of Victoria. My  sympathies  are with the men who follow this occupation, because they are in a precarious position. Not long ago, I  passed  through the Derwent Valley in Tasmania, where thousands of pounds have been invested in the hop industry, and found that the farmers there were taking on the cultivation of tobacco in the hope that they might regain some of the prosperity that they formerly enjoyed; but in their new venture also they have met with misfortune, because blue mould, which is rampant in the Derwent Valley, has practically destroyed their crops. A reasonable reduction of the excise duty on beer would result in the price of it being reduced. Its consumption would then increase, and more employment would be provided. The duty on beer was reduced recently in England by one penny a pint, and, as a result, the consumption immediately increased. Viscount Snowden was Chancellor of the Exchequer when the reduction was made. In introducing the proposal, he said that it would assist towards the general rehabilitation of trade and commerce in England, and that the revenue would benefit from the resultant greater consumption. That is what happened. The increased consumption of beer in England has meant more work in breweries and hotels, as well as in allied industries. High taxation of the liquor trade is a form of prohibition, because, on account of the existing prices, due to the heavy duties, liquor is passing beyond the reach of the average wage-earner. The output of beer in Australia for the year ended the 30th June, 1928, was 74,663,722 gallons, but at the end of June, 1932, it had fallen to 47,670,490 gallons, a reduction of about 40 per cent. If the high price of 9d. a pint in the capital cities is maintained, the consumption of beer will continue to decline. The serious effect which the high duties have on the brewing industry must be realized. Over 40,000,000 fewer beer bottles are being used in Australia as a result, of the enormous reduction in consumption. In New South "Wales alone the reduction in the number of bottles in. 1932, compared with 1930, was 17,500,000, while in Victoria it was about 14,000,000. This has meant a vast restriction of employment. Those engaged in the manufacture of cases and crates have also been most adversely affected. In New South "Wales, in 1932, the cases made were 106,306 fewer than in 1930. In 1929, primary products to the following extent were used in the manufacture of beer in Australia: Malt,' 2,437,600 bushels; hops, 2,343,012 lb.; sugar, 34,191,808 lb. Owing to the decline in the consumption of beer, there was a huge drop in the use of those commodities in 1931, amounting to 10,000,000 lb. in the case of sugar alone, the figures for that year being, malt, 1,798,573 bushels; hops, 1,699,827 lb.; sugar, 24,503,024 lb. Can one wonder at State Governments finding it difficult to balance their budgets? The official figures for 1932 show that, so far as primary products are concerned, the position became considerably worse. In that year the decline in the use of sugar had increased to over 13,000,000 lb., while the quantity of hops used was down by 924,039 lb., and malt by 905,827 bushels, the figures being: Malt, 1,531,773 bushels; hops, 1,418,973 lb.; and sugar, 21,092,176 lb. High taxation has been largely responsible for the huge decline in the demand for bottles, cases, crates, and the ' primary products used in the manufacture of beer. </para>

          <para class="block">In normal times, the excise duty on beer returned in revenue to the Federal Government £6,190,725. It is believed that a reduction of excise duty by from8d. to1s. a gallon, combined with a reduction in the retail prices, would result in a greatly increased consumption, and consequently the collection of additional revenue by the Treasury. It would also mean a more extensive use of barley, hops and sugar, and in additional employment in the making of bottles, barrels, cases, and crates. </para>
          <para>Statistics covering the period during which the excise tariff on beer has been increased from 3d. to 2s. a gallon, an increase of 700 per cent., reveal that the increase of revenue to the Commonwealth practically corresponds with the increase of duty until the year 1928-29, which was the peak of beer excise revenue. In that year, it reached £6,190,725, at 2s. a gallon, being an increase of 681 per cent, over the figures for 1913-14, when the rate was 3d. a gallon. Since 1928-29, the revenue has declined, and for the year ended the 30th June last, it 'had fallen to £4,767,049, disclosing a drop of 30 per cent, in three years. Honorable senators have said a good deal about the desirability of assisting primary and secondary industries. Here is a chance to give practical help to both, by stimulating the sales of malt, barley, hops, timber, and sugar, and the manufacture of engines, casks, and cases.' I commend my request to the favorable consideration of the Senate. </para>

            <para>. - There are two outstanding items which are dealt with under the excise which contribute to the comfort and enjoyment of the average Australian citizen - tobacco and beer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> has dealt with the tobacco position most extensively, and I am in accord with his remarks generally on the subject. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I desire now to deal with the important subject of beer, and urge the Government to reduce the excise on that product so that the public may be enabled to buy it. I am convinced that only by a reduction in the rate of excise on beer can this most palatable beverage be restored to the tables of the people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> has moved a request that the excise should be reduced by 8d. a gallon, and the public would be most thankful if the Government acceded to the request. I hope that there will be a reduction of excise of at least 6d. a gallon, an amount which could easily be passed on. The present rate ofexcise is 2s. a gallon, or 4d. a bottle, and a reduction of 6d. a gallon would make it possible to reduce the beer by1d. a bottle. </para>
          <para>It must be remembered that, in addition to the excessive federal excise of 4d. a bottle on beer, the State Governments also tax this and other liquors heavily. In most States, the licensing fees for hotels are heavy, and are paid in lump sums, and, in addition, varying amounts, which sometimes reach 7 per cent., are collected by the State Government on liquor purchases. It will be seen, therefore, that intoxicating liquors, and particularly beer, are subject to exceptionally heavy taxation. It would almost appear that the Federal and State Governments were endeavouring to bring about prohibition by taxation, a policy to which I am entirely opposed. Ministers in the Senate recently made the satisfactory statement that the Government was considering the desirability of reducing the rates of duty on Scotch whisky in order to obtain from this source a greater revenue as a result of increased imports. The Australian public read that statement, and were pleased; but they are asking why even greater relief should not be given to the community by reducing the rates on beer which is manufactured in the Commonwealth entirely from Australian products. The Government must have noticed the reduced consumption of beer as shown by the customs and excise figures, and I am of the opinion that, unless something is done in the direction of granting a reduction in excise duty, that downward drift will most assuredly continue. </para>
          <para>For some considerable time there has been a definite demand throughout Australia for cheaper beer. The consumer contends that wages, rents, and interest have been reduced, in addition to the price of foodstuffs and wearing apparel, and, quite naturally, he asks when the price of beer is going to be reduced. The price of this commodity to the public has always been regulated by the amount of excise duty; in other words, all increases in the price of beer have been made a3 a result of increases in the excise duty, and it is impossible to reduce the price of this article, to fall into line with the reduced spending power of the people, until such time as a reasonable reduction is obtained in the excise duty. Ministers talk a good deal about the Premiers plan, and the Government having reduced pensions and the wages of civil servants by approximately 22-J per cent. ; but I have yet to find that it has reduced charges on products such as beer by any amount at all. If the spending public is to reap any benefit under the Premiers plan, it is time that the Government reduced its taxation by 22£ per cent, in every direction, including excise. I know of nothing that would create more employment than a reduction of the burden of federal taxation. </para>
          <para>I am assured that the Licensed Victuallers Association of New South Wales has approached the Commonwealth Government, and has stated that it has no desire to gain any additional profit from the reduction of the excise duty; that it has given the Prime Minister (My. Lyons) a specific undertaking that any such reduction will be passed on to the consuming public. A similar assurance has been given by the producers of Australian whisky. Some persons do not drink intoxicating liquors to-day, because they cannot afford to do so on account of their reduced earnings. A reduction in price would again bring these beverages within the . reach of the people, which would result in increased sales. </para>
          <para>The following official figures will show the extent to which the consumption of beer has fallen off in Australia: - </para>

              <para>- That ia excellent news; but, at the same time, I am confident that, if the Government wishes the revenue again to become normal, it must reduce the rate of excise as was done with marked success from a revenue aspect in Great Britain. It must not be forgotten that the reduction in the consumption of beer has a serious effect upon the primary producer, as the commodities used in the manufacture of this article are products of the Australian soil. Comparing the years 1927 and 1932, the decrease in the consumption was: malt, 905,827 bushels; hops, 924,039 lb.; and sugar, 13,099,632 lb. The reduction in the use of beer also has a serious effect upon subsidiary and associated industries, and upon the revenue of the railways department, as the quantity of beer forwarded to country centres has declined alarmingly, and it i3 a commodity upon which the very highest rates of freights are charged. At present many hotels are working with skeleton staffs during the major portion of the week, relying on the employment of casual labour at the week-end, when the only reasonable volume of business is done. They have been forced to do this because their business does not warrant the employment of what was in former years a normal number of employees. By increasing the volume of business, the hotelkeeper will, of necessity, have to increase his staff to cope with it. </para>

          <para>The only solution of the existing drift in the consumption of beer is the reduction in its price to the consumer to bring this into line with his reduced spending power, and that can be achieved only by a substantial lowering of the existing excise duties. Such a course would mean an increase, and not a decrease, of the revenue, because of the greater amount of beer that would be consumed. This was proved in Great Britain  recently. </para>

The two things definitely exist; but they are quite distinct. We cannot alter the excise duties without either increasing or decreasing the measure of protection given to the industry concerned, unless there is a corresponding addition to, or deduction, from the customs revenue. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> who is the greatest advocate of freetrade in this chamber, has considered that aspect of the subject. </para><continue>

Only yesterday I heard the honorable senator say that not once during the tariff debate had he voted for a higher duty, and that in no circumstances would he do so. I submit that he cannot vote for a lower excise duty on tobacco, beer, or whisky, without voting for  a  higher measure of protection to the industry concerned. ' </para>

              <para>- The position definitely is that the honorable senator proposes to vote for the collection of less revenue, and also, in the case of the three commodities which I have mentioned, for a greater measure of protection. I want the honorable senator to realize what he is doing. Ho says that he will never vote for a higher duty or for a greater measure of protection, and then he tells us that he proposes to do the thing which he says he will not do. The honorable senator also said something about the continuous diminution of the revenue from beer. That is not a fact, because last year the revenue from the excise on beer was greater than in the previous year. The consumption of beer is on the up-grade; last year's consumption exceeded that of the preceding year by about 1,000,000 gallons. While I do not dispute that the increase of the price of beer has definitely affected consumption, I do say that we have passed the trough of the depression ; things are gradually improving, and, consequently, we oan 'expect a gradual increase of the revenue from dutiable goods. The purchasing power of the community as a whole is greater than it was several months ago. When a Treasurer 'sets himself the task of collecting a certain amount of revenue from various sources, including excise, that revenue must be obtained if at all possible. Honorable senators have only to study the sources of the Government's revenue, and the channels of expenditure, to realize that a government which has set out to obtain a certain sum by way of revenue has not much left after it has met its interest bill, repatriation obligations, invalid and old age pension commitments, and has made payments to the States. Leaving out of our consideration for the moment the revenue and expenditure of the Post Office - a department which, more or less, pays its own way - we find that, apart from the expenditure on defence, there are only a few million pounds left with which to come and go. A certain sum must be obtained each year from excise duties, which, I submit, is a legitimate source of revenue; it has always been so regarded in every country in the world. The main thing is so to adjust the levying of duties as to get the best results. I am not in a position to say what the final view of the Government on these subjects will be; I only know that it must obtain a certain, revenue each year. It is the Government's duty to dev.ise means for obtaining that revenue. &lt; Three suggestions have been made this morning. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> asked for  a  reduction of ls. 6d. per lb. on the excise on tobacco leaf; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> sought a reduction of 8d. a gallon in the excise on beer; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> who would have been satisfied with a reduction of 6d. a gallon in the case of beer, suggested a reduction of 5s. a gallon on Australian whisky. </para>

              <para>- He did not mention rum. On the basis of last year's consumption of beer in Australia, the proposed reduction of the duty would result in a loss of £1,622,615 on that one item alone. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para class="block">Honorable senators will agree that that is a fairly substantial sum. I take it that the only purpose of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy's</inline> proposal for the reduction of the excise on Australian tobacco leaf is to increase the consumption of Australian leaf. The honorable senator is seeking a greater measure of protection to the growers of tobacco leaf in this country; he wants to see a greater consumption of the locallyproduced tobacco. If his suggestion were given effect, the loss of revenue from that source might easily amount to £1,036,174 a year. Compared with those losses, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston's</inline> suggestion for a reduction of 5s. a gallon in the excise duty on whisky appears quite moderate, for it represents only about £33,629. Together, however, the three items would bring in £2,692,418 less revenue, if reduced as suggested. </para><interjection>

There will be another opportunity to discuss these matters when the budget proposals are before us. I cannot say now what the Government may decide to do, but I cannot envisage a position in which it would be either safe or desirable to budget for any appreciable reduction of the revenue received last year from excise. We all hope that when the Government brings down its budget, it may be able to afford to the Australian public a relief which will be really worth while, and materially assist in placing this country once more on the road to prosperity. </para>

            <para>. - The Minister has put up an eloquent plea for the retention of the excessive duty on beer, and he has stated that even if the excise were reduced, there would be no appreciable increase of consumption. The experience in this and other countries is to the contrary, because practically in every instance in which the excise has been reduced on popular commodities, their consumption has largely increased, and the revenue has benefited considerably thereby. Every ingredient used in the making of beer in this country is an Australian product, and therefore, if we stimulate the consumption of beer by reducing the excise, we shall encourage subsidiary industries as well. The brewing of beer absorbs a considerable quantity of sugar. The figures for the year ending June, 1931, show that compared with the year ending </para>

              <para>- It is clearly evident that Queensland senators are prepared to act in the interests only of their own State. By reducing the excise duty, we shall stimulate not only the beer industry, but also the hop, barley and sugar industries, with a consequent benefit to the Government by way of income and other taxation. As the excise on beer has increased, so has the quantity consumed decreased. Although the latest figures show that there has been an. increase in consumption, it is small indeed compared with ' the consumption a few years ago, when the price of beer was considerably lower than it is to-day. The figures supplied by the Minister show that in 1920, the consumption of beer was 69,000,000 gallons, whereas last year, it was 48,000,000 gallons. If it is the intention of the Government to bring about prohibition, it should make a straightout announcement to that effect and increase the excise to, say, 5s. a gallon. Very little profit is being made to-day by either the wholesale or retail sections of the trade, and so far as I can gather, many hotelkeepers are on the verge of bankruptcy.. </para>

            <para>. - We should do everything within our power to encourage the tobacco industry, because there is every possibilitiy of its developing into a great Australian industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> has put up a convincing case on behalf of the tobacco growers, who have already demonstrated that they can supply the Australian consumers with a tobacco equal to the imported article. The Government's tariff proposals will not, by any means, give the tobacco-growers the encouragement that they are entitled to expect from this National Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> has clearly shown that if his proposal is agreed to, the Government will suffer no loss of revenue. Therefore, honorable senators should not hesitate to accept it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Beer, like tea, is a national beverage, because about 90 per cent, of the workers of this country indulge in it to a lesser or greater extent. It is produced in every country in the world, and is usually purchaseable at a price well within the capacity of the pockets of the people who do the hard work of the country. The Government is fearful that if the excise is reduced it will be faced with a loss of revenue. Our surplus revenue this year is estimated at £3,500,000. Since it has been stated that the Government wishes to spread that surplus over the population of Australia so as to give the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people, I suggest that by decreasing the excise as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> relief will be spread over the greatest number of people who are in dire need of it. The production of beer throughout Australia for the year ended the 30th June, 1928, was 74,600,000 gallons, but at the end of June last year it had fallen to 47,600,000, or a reduction of 40 per cent. That falling off of production can be accounted for in many ways, but chiefly because of the unemployment of a vast number of our people, and their consequent incapacity to purchase beer at any price. The British Government by decreasing the excise on beer increased its revenue, and there is no reason why a reduction of excise in this country should not have a similar effect. It should be remembered that a number of primary products are used in the manufacture of beer. In 1929, the manufacturers took 2,437,600 bushels of malt, 2,343,012 lb.  of hops, and 34.191.S08 lb. of sugar; but, in 1931, owing to the decline in the consumption of beer, there was a tremendous curtailment of the use of those products in the manufacture of beer, the figures being : Malt, 1,798,573 bushels; hops, 1,699,827 lb.; sugar, 24.503,024 lb. The reduction in the quantity of sugar used was nearly 10,000,000 lb.,' and, in 1932, the decline was over 13,000,000 lb. Although the Minister who represents the Treasury in this chamber claims that the present excise duties on beer and tobacco are required for revenue purposes, the Opposition contends that the revenue position would not be seriously affected by lowering them, because this would lead to an increase of the consumption of these commodities. </para>
          <para>I find it difficult to obtain pipe tobacco made from leaf grown in Australia. Last Monday I inquired at a leading shop in my home town for the particular brand of Australian tobacco that I like, and was informed that it could not be obtained. I consider myself a connoisseur of tobacco, and I prefer the locally-grown article to any imported tobacco. The fact that tobacco made from, local leaf cannot be procured from a leading shop shows the stranglehold that the overseas interests have obtained upon an infant Australian industry. It would be in the interests of- the people of this country so to adjust the customs and excise tariffs as to increase the use of" tobacco made from Australian leaf. </para>
          <para>A number of honorable senators on the Opposition side do not drink beer, but I am not one of them. The statistics show that the finances would not be so seriously affected as the Minister representing the Treasury would have us believe, by a reduction of the excise duties on beer. The figures submitted this morning by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> were quite convincing as to the relief that would be given to the primary producers if the excise rates suggested by him were adopted. It is well known that probably 98 per cent, of the men employed on the waterfront enjoy a glass of beer at the end of a hard day's toil, and in using this national beverage, they are helping important sections of the primary producers. The Government, by its excise proposals, is not prepared to study the interests of those who do the arduous work of this country, including those who grow hops, sugar and barley; it prefers to use a portion of its surplus revenue to relieve from taxation those who conduct big businesses in Collins-street, Melbourne, and George-street, Sydney. </para>

              <para>- We have been treated to some interesting observations from a double-headed political monstrosity, the Opposition in this chamber, as it is constituted to-day. I was astounded at the crocodile tears shed so liberally by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> over the plight of the primary producers. This is the gentleman who was a member of a government which imposed so high a tariff against the commodities used by the primary producers that it has ever since embarrassed the relations between the present Government with its erstwhile friends, the Country party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> rejoiced my heart by voicing the sentiment which I have been praying to hear from him during the last five or six weeks. He said that the high tariff placed on tobacco by the last Government imposed on the present Government the moral obligation to protect the interests of the industry. That is the principle which has' been our guide in dealing with tariff amendments. Many industries have sprung up under the protection of extraordinarily high duties, and the Government has had to take action to prevent a crash. I assure honorable senators that this moral responsibility has been recognized and accepted by the Government in its dealings with the tobacco industry. </para>

          <para>The Leader of the Opposition made one or two interesting statements. He said that we in Australia were producing tobacco equal to that produced anywhere else in the world. That is an exaggeration, and I speak as one who has taken a part in the production of tobacco. Then he said that Australian tobacco was put on the market at a cheaper price than imported tobacco. So it should, seeing that it enjoys protection to the extent of 300 per cent. </para>

              <para>- Yes, in that respect we also excel. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> described this as an industry of mushroom growth. That is true; but the growth has been due", not so much to the imposition of high duties by the Scullin Government, as to a realization by the people, after learning the result of expert investigations, that there was something to be made out of tobacco. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> stated that, under an import duty of 2s. per lb., production in Australia was small, and that, when the duty was first increased to 3s. per lb., production did not materially increase. In view, however, of the fact that a period of only three months had elapsed - from August, 1929, to November, 1929 - no material increase could have been looked for. He sought to justify the import duty of 5s. 2d. per lb. by pointing to the enormous increase of production that followed upon its imposition. Let me remind him that the important thing is not quantity, but quality. Of the 13,000,000 lb. produced last year, not one-third was of the quality demanded by the Australian smoker: The honorable senator stressed our adverse trade balance with the United States of America, and pointed to it as a reason for developing our own tobacco industry, so that we would not have to import from America. He ignored the fact, however, that for years leaf was imported from America, on which millions of pounds of revenue was obtained. The value of those importations in relation, to the revenue obtained by the Commonwealth Government on them was low. In 1929-30, imports of tobacco leaf from the United States of America were valued at £1,739,423, which includes cigarette leaf. The revenue collected on this, both import and excise, was approximately £5,800,000, so that for every pound remitted to the United States of America for leaf, the Common wealth collected £3 7s. 6d. In addition to this benefit, considerable employment was provided by the importers. </para>

          <para>The honorable senator must know quite well that the reduction of the Australian crop to 6,000,000 lb. this year has nothing whatever to do with the reduction of duty. Blue mould and unfavorable seasonal conditions are alone responsible for the decline in production. As great an area is being planted to-day as ever, notwithstanding the fact that it is enjoying only 300 per cent, protection! I put it to honorable senators that the industry is sufficiently protected as it is. It is being looked . after in the only way that will ensure its becoming an economic and sound undertaking. There is hope for the industry under the existing tariff, but there would be no hope for it if we were to encourage its growth in the way that has been done in the past. It would kill itself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> said that we should develop the tobacco' industry. I agree, but we should not coddle it, because in that way we should encompass its destruction. In Canada, the industry has prospered with protection amounting only to1s. 8d. per lb., which it receives under the excise tariff. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> does not disguise the fact that his proposal for varying the excise rate would, if given effect, be merely another way of giving the industry additional protection. The Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Massy Greene)</inline> has addressed the Senate on the financial effects of varying the duty. I assure honorable senators that the Government has the interests of the industry at heart. We gave evidence of that during the regime of the Bruce-Page Government, and we continue to do so to-day. If honorable senators wish to bring the industry to ruin, they will insist upon a reduction of the excise duty on Australian leaf used in manufacture. </para>

            <para>. - I support the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant. Senator Payne</inline> should voice his criticisms of this industry to those of his constituents who are engaged in bop-growing in the Derwent Valley. Although many of them have lost their crops, they have to pay heavy rates of interest to the banking institutions from which they have obtained advances. Hopgrowing is the chief industry in the Derwent Valley, and it is only right that every assistance should be given to this and other sections of primary producers. Australians are moderate drinkers.

              <para>- That may be so. The reduction proposed is the lowest that would enable them to reduce the cost to consumers in Sydney. [ imagine that a similar reduction would be made in Melbourne. It would have been much easier to pass on a reduction of 6d. a gallon,' but I know that a reduction of excise to the extent suggested would benefit the consumers in the direction mentioned in Melbourne and Sydney. Throughout Australia licensed victuallers have promised that the whole of any reduction of excise duty will be passed on to the public. </para>

I decline to vote on this item in order to appeal to primary producers, or to make my vote the medium of voicing social ideals as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline> This is purely a taxing provision, .and it should be considered entirely from that viewpoint. It appears from the figures that we have reached the point at which what economists term "the 'law of diminishing returns" is beginning to operate. . Instead of duties of this kind producing more revenue, they are producing le3s. I did not support the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn,</inline> because it appeared to me that the probable loss of revenue mentioned by the Minister in charge of the bill was so great as to make us pause. But here we have an opportunity to test whether, in fact, the law of diminishing returns is operating. In this case, the risk is not bo great. </para>

              <para>- I am quite aware that in this, as in other matters, there- is always more than one factor to be considered. When it is said that there has been a great falling off, a part of it - probably the greater part - may be due to the fact that the purchasing power of the people has been decreased. But, the experience in Great Britain, where the position is parallel to ours, seems to show that the falling off in the consumption of alcoholic liquor has been due to the fact that there the point mentioned by economists has been reached, and that in order to produce more revenue, it has been found necessary to reduce excise duties. I shall support this request which provides for a small reduction of the duties. </para>

            <para>.- I am in entire agreement with the proposal submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> providing for a reduction of the excise duties in order to restore revenue from this source to the point it reached some time ago, because the imposition of heavy excise duties has, in many instances, resulted in decreasing rather than increasing revenue. The Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Massy 'Greene)</inline> has, however, told us that these and other duties are being taken into consideration by the Government in framing the budget. I have promised the Licensed Victuallers  Association in Queensland that I will do all in my power to assist them in the direction of granting relief in matters of taxation, and I think it fair to grant relief in this direction. "We have no right to endeavour to bring about prohibition by means of taxation. "We had a very fair statement from the Assistant Treasurer when we were dealing with the import duties on whisky, and we had another fair statement to-day. I believe that the Government is endeavouring, where possible, to give relief from taxation. Accordingly, I intend to support the item. .

            <para>[2.49]. - Again I appeal to the committee to consider the budget aspect of these excise duties. To me, it seems to be utterly wrong to deal with individual items in the schedule, and decide that the excise on this one shall be so much, and the excise on others some other amount. The Treasurer is required to produce what I regard as a balanced budget - something that will appeal to the country, and assist to keep industry going. To do this, regard must be paid to all the factors that affect industry and the revenue. If the committee of the Senate decides that the excise on beer shall be an amount less than that provided, and that the excise on tobacco shall also be less than is set out in the schedule, is it not apparent to honorable senators that much of the preparatory work in connexion with the budget will be destroyed ? If the Treasurer, when considering his budget arrangements, knows that the Senate committee has reached a certain decision in regard to the excise on some of these items, will not his position be rendered almost impossible? </para>

              <para>- That, in itself, is definite evidence of responsibility in regard to the  budget residing in the House of Representatives. I, therefore, appeal, to the committee not to hamper the Treasurer in the preparation of the budget, by carrying requests for a reduction of the excise on this or any other item, which necessarily will mean reduced revenue. I appeal to honorable senators, as far as possible, and in accordance with their conscience, to leave the Government free to arrange the budget in such a way as to be able to do the best possible thing for the country. As I stated this morning, the requested amendments forecast would, if agreed to, mean a reduction of the revenue by approximately £2,600,000, thus making it impossible for the Government to give full effect to its proposals for relief from taxation in other directions. It is desirable that, as far as possible, the Government should be free  to frame its budget without any impediment, such as would be interposed if the request were carried. </para>

          <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales) [2.53].  -  If the remarks of the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Massy Greene)</inline> mean anything, they mean that, if the committee does not wish to embarrass the Government, it must refrain from making any alterations to this schedule of excise duties, because every argument that has been adduced in support of the requested amendment to reduce the excise duty on beer applies with equal force to many other items. Consequently, if we accept the argument of the Assistant Treasurer, the discussion of the schedule is a mere farce. If the constitutional position of the Senate is so weak that it is forbidden to request any alteration of the excise duties, then the Government should run the country without the aid of Parliament. </para>

            <para>That the House of Representatives be requested to make the duty, sub-item (d), twice occurring, per proof gallon, 23s. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This request is made because of the statement of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> in this chamber a few weeks ago, in regard to consideration being given to the reduction of the duty on Scotch whisky. It is felt that the present is an appropriate occasion to impress on the Government the fact that Australian whisky should be treated on at least as generous a basis as that on which it is proposed to deal with Scotch whisky. For the five years ended the 30th June, 1930, the average annual quantity of Australian whisky upon which excise duty was paid was 211,588 gallons. During the succeeding two years the quantities on which excise duty was paid were : 1931, 151,357 gallons; 1932, 141,429 gallons. It will be seen that the consumption for 1932 was 70,159 gallons below the annual average for the five-year period to the 30th June, 1930. The figures for the year ended the 30th June, 1933, are not yet available. They will, however, show a further drop. The position that has arisen is one of grave concern to all the distillery interests' in the Commonwealth. Some years ago there were five distilleries in Victoria making whisky, one in New South Wales, and one in South Australia. The distillery in New South Wales was closed many years ago, but three of the distilleries in Victoria have been operating full time until the last two years. </para>
          <para>The serious decrease in the consumption of Australian whisky, which has arisen from causes entirely outside the control of the distilleries, and is mainly ascribable to the high taxation on the commodity, has caused a condition of grave concern to 'the shareholders in these Australian companies, and has resulted in a considerable diminution of employment. There has been an entire cessation of whisky-distilling in Victoria, in which the industry was mainly centred. The only distilleries now operating are two small distilleries in South Australia, both of which are of comparatively recent establishment, and neither of which is a major factor in the trade. It is estimated that there is enough Australian whisky now in bonded warehouses in the Commonwealth to last for twenty years, with consumption at the present rate. If the Government wishes to improve the consumption in the interests of revenue, it is obvious that the only way to secure the release of these huge stocks of whisky that are unsaleable at the present time owing to the high prices that have to be charged to secure the excise duty of 28s. a proof gallon imposed by the Commonwealth G-overnment, is to lower the duty to such a figure as will enable the public again to consume this commodity. The figures I have given show that it is not the quality of the spirit produced, but the all-important factor of price, that has been responsible for the drop in trade. The Victorian distilleries at present wholly closed down are the Federal, Port Melbourne; Dunnstown, Ballarat; and Corio, Geelong. Two of these distilleries are equipped with the most up-to-date plant, and in the past they have given a great deal of employment. Moreover, from the point of view of the primary producer, they have been large users of grain, most of which has been produced in Victoria and South Australia. The average amount of barley and malt used in any one of these distilleries exceeds 100,000 bushels per annum, which meant a profitable outlet for the grower. In addition to the loss to the grain producer, there has also been a loss in wages, fuel, water, and other charges incidental to the process of manufacture. It is estimated that, in the Victorian distilleries alone, there was distributed in the various avenues mentioned something like £1,500 a week. The entire cessation of distilling, involving the economic loss of this expenditure, is solely due to the fact that the industry has been taxed out of existence. I believe that, if the excise duty were reduced, the . Government would receive a greater amount of revenue as' the result of increased consumption as was experienced in Great Britain. </para>

            <para>. - It <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> quite true, as the honorable senator has stated, that withdrawals of whisky from bond decreased steadily from 1927-28 to 1931-32, when they appeared to become static. The figures for last year are not yet complete, but I understand that they will probably show a slight decrease. When dealing with the customs duty on whisky for blending purposes, I indicated to the honorable senator, and to other honorable senators who were associated with him in his request for the reduction of the duty, that the matter has to be considered as a whole. Should any relief be given by way of customs duty, the excise duty will have to be brought into harmony with the position thus created. The action that I took in regard to blended whisky shows that there is a disposition on the part of the Government to assist the industry to increase its output. I shall presently propose a similar request in connexion with the excise duty. I assure the honorable senator that the matter is having the closest consideration of the Government, and I ask him not to press his request. </para>

          <para class="block">My first reason for doing so is that, in 1931, the House of Representatives altered the period required for maturation of Australian whisky from two to three years, so creating a differentiation between brandy and whisky for which, on the merits of the case, there is no justification. My second reason is that the matter does not adversely affect the revenue; actually the shorter period of maturation would put forward the collection of the excise by twelve months. </para>
          <para>One might reasonably ask why different periods of maturation should be prescribed for brandy and whisky. A reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> discloses that, on the 16th October, 1931, the House of Representatives altered the period for whisky from two to three years, and since then the matter has not been referred to this committee for consideration in detail - although, I suppose, it has been covered in general terms by a validating act. The amendment was submitted by the member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bernard Corser)</inline> and supported by Messrs. Nairn, Bayley, R. Green, McGrath and Riley. The then Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> opposed the proposal, and stated that he had received notice of it only a day or two before, and asked for permission to refer the matter to the Tariff Board for investigation and report. The honorable gentleman also pointed out that while the proposal apparently had the approval of the United Distilleries, it would prove a hardship to the smaller distilleries, particularly in South Australia, a forecast which has since proved correct. Despite- the protests of the Minister for Trade and Customs, the amendment wa3 carried on the voices, with, I submit, inadequate discussion, and mainly on the argument that maturation for three years would make Australian whisky a more palatable, healthy drink. One honorable member said that no whisky drinker would consume whisky if he knew that it had been matured for only two years, an absurd argument which I hope to refute in the few minutes that I shall need to detain the committee in connexion with this matter. </para>

              <para>- I am not speaking against adequate maturation, but wish to prove, scientifically, that it is impossible to distinguish between two Australian whiskies which have been matured, respectively, for two and three years. The argument against a 3-year period of maturation is, however, not concerned with that aspect, the main consideration being that the longer period has had a detrimental effect on the smaller distilleries. Obviously, the longer period of maturation is of advantage to old established distilleries because of the greater amount of capital that it will keep "frozen", thus discouraging new firms from beginning business. 1, personally, d'o not stand for preventing persons from putting their capital into industry merely to conserve the interests of one large concern, which has had a great start, but believe that the new firm should also be given a chance. </para>

          <para>The arguments on which I rely are first that a 2-year period of maturation was adopted in Australia in 1906 on the recommendation of the Royal- Commission on Customs and Excise Tariffs, and remained unaltered until 1931, being then altered after a discussion of about a quarter of an hour and without any sound reason having been advanced for the change. My second reason is that a term of two years is at present, in force in Canada. It is true that the period in England is three years, but I shall show from quotations that whisky matures much more rapidly in Australia than it does in the Mother Country, and that whisky that has been kept in wood in Australia for two years is equal to that which has been kept  in wood for four years in England. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hargreaves,</inline> the Government Analyst and Director of the Department of Chemistry in South Australia, was given a number of bottles of whisky ranging over a period of five years, which he tested, and he found that it was not possible to detect the effect of the maturity on the spirit from year to year. In his report, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hargreaves</inline> cited not only his own experiments, but also a number of authorities, including Crampton and Tolman, the Bureau of Inland Revenue of the United States of America, and <inline font-style="italic">Alcohol and ils Production,</inline> by C. Simmonds. The testimony of this leading chemist, the gist of which I now quote, should finally dispose of the contention that public health is being conserved by increasing the period of maturation from two years to three years - </para>

            <para>In Australia, usually, the water goes out (through the wood) at a faster rate than the alcohol, owing to high evaporation. ... In Great Britain, water evaporates at a slower rate proportionately than does the alcohol, and there is a loss of alcoholic strength on keeping . . . Throughout all the published figures relating to American and Scotch spirits which I have seen, the outstanding evidence is that the major portion of the changes during storage occurs during the first few months, and certainly within the first year, and a general view shows that there is little advantage in storing for two years over one year, and less advantage still for storage for three years over two years. . . . </para>

            <para>There is a well-defined difference between the new spirit and the one year old sample, but there are no marked differences between the one year old, the two years old, the three years old and the four years old spirits. </para>
            <para>It may be. said that the undesirable constituents in whisky that can be removed or changed by storage, are so removed or changed during the first few months, and any subsequent storage is for the purpose of improving colour, . flavour and aroma, and increasing the extra or " body ". These things depend, as already pointed out, much more upon the kind of cask than upon the timein which the spirit is stored therein. </para>

            <para>With our greater evaporation, we should obtain sufficient maturity and concentration in half the time required in Great Britain, so that storage for two' years in South Australia should produce as wholesome spirit as would be obtained in England or Scotland in four years. . . . </para>
            <para>Speaking generally, there is no evidence, either from these samples or from the analytical data that I have seen with respect to other spirits, to show that spirits matured in wood for two years are not so good and wholesome as those stored for three years. . . . There is, however, much evidence to indicate that spirits should be kept for some months, say, up to twelve months. Beyond that the improvement is more a matter of the kind of cask than of the number of years of storage. </para>

            <para>. - In regard to the scientific side of the matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> has made out a strong case; hut, legally, we seem to have placed ourselves in a cleft stick. During 1932, this Parliament passed an amendment of the Spirits Act. In sections 11 and 12 of that statute which must harmonize with the Excise Act, were inserted provisos that, in respect of both imported whisky and whisky distilled in Australia, the period of maturity by storage in wood shall be not less than three years. Those amendments were deliberately made by the Senate, certainly without much discussion, following the amendment of the Excise Tariff. The alteration of the period of maturation was made in the House of Representatives in opposition to the views of the government of the day and the Trade and Customs Department. Certainly the change is further deferred to the 1st October, 1935, but that does not overcome the objections mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> or the scientific proof he has adduced that the alteration is unnecessary. However, having regard to the present requirements of the Spirits Act, we can do no more than ask the Minister for Trade and Customs if he will introduce an amending bill to reduce the period of maturation- to two years. </para>

          <para class="block">Notwithstanding that the speech of the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Massy Greene)</inline> might convey the impression that this chamber is a chamber of robots, I still believe that, in dealing with the excise duties, we should give expression to our views. I regard a duty of 30s. a gallon on rum as another injustice to a Queensland industry, because most of the rum manufactured in Australia is produced in that State. Prior to the Ottawa Conference, rum made in Australia enjoyed a protective margin of11s. a gallon over imported rum. Now that margin is only 6s. a gallon. The protective margin is 18s. a gallon in the case of brandy, and 17s. a gallon on both whisky and gin. Why should it be only 6s. a gallon on rum? We are told that rum is a spirit of lower quality than whisky or brandy, and that its use should not be encouraged. I point out, however, that rum has to mature for two years, and is quite as good a beverage as other spirits which enjoy a greater measure of protection. Nelson gave rum to his men, and the troops at the Great War were supplied with a rum ration. Australian gin, which is manufactured almost entirely in Victoria, enjoys a protective margin of 17s. a gallon, although it has not to mature in the wood for two years. Although the rum industry does not employ a great number of workers there is no reason why it should be treated unfairly. I hope that the committee will agree to the request. </para>

            <para>. - The proposed excise duties on both standard and blended ruin represent an increase of 2s. a gallon on the 1921-28 excise tariff. Actually, the higher duties have been in force since the 22nd August, 1929, when they, in common with the excise duties on other spirits, were raised by the Bruce-Page Government to meet the financial exigencies of the time. The proposed rates are the same as those imposed by the Scullin Government. There has been a marked decline in the demand for rum, with the result that the distilleries, which are confined mainly to Queensland, have been unable to dispose of their output. The rum-producing interests have engaged in extensive propaganda against both the customs and the excise duties. The first contention was that the Government's action in extending the British preferential rate to rum which is the product of British colonies had adversely affected Australian production. An examination of import statistics covering the period subsequent to the Ottawa agreement showed that the imports were practically negligible, and definitely established that this contention was entirely fallacious. The rum-producers then argued that the disparity between the excise duties on whisky and rum - the excise duty on rum is 2s. a gallon higher than on whisky - was responsible for the decline in the demand for rum; but an analysis of the figures covering the customs and excise clearances of spirits from bond in recent years, which form a reliable guide to the quantities of the respective spirits going into consumption, does not support this contention. Taking the customs and excise clearances for 1928-29 as a basis of comparison, we find that the consumption of whisky has declined 57.2 per cent., whereas the drop in the consumption of rum is only 48.3 per cent. During the last fiscal year 283,000 gallons of Australian rum were cleared from bond, compared with only 142,000 gallons of Australian whisky. It is also interesting to note that 71 per cent, of the whisky consumed was imported whisky, which carried customs duties ranging from 45s. to 53s. per gallon. On the other hand, almost the whole of the rum which went into consumption was of Australian origin, dutiable at 30s. a gallon. Imported rum comprised less than 9,000 gallons out of a total consumption of 292,000 gallons. Furthermore, the reduction of 2s. a proof gallon, when applied to sales in the nobbier, is so small that it could not be passed on to consumers. It is, therefore, difficult to see how the desired reduction would increase the demand for rum. </para>

          <para>When it is remembered that rum is produced from molasses, a by-product in the manufacture of sugar, and that whisky is produced from primary products, such as barley and other grains, which it is impossible to produce at anything approaching the price at which molasses is obtainable, it will be evident to honorable senators that the rumproducers are in a most advantageous position in the matter of costs, and are, therefore, in a position to carry the  higher  impost. </para>

            <para>. - The excise on Australian brandies and whiskies is 2s. less than it is on Queensland rum, and if the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> is agreed to the excise on those three commodities will be brought into line. Previously, Australian rum enjoyed a marginal difference of lis. a proof gallon over foreign rum, the respective rates being 30s. and 41s.- a gallon. The recent decisions at Ottawa reduced the import duty on foreign rum, including that from the West Indies, to 36s., and in the short time that has elapsed since then there has been a considerable increase in the importation of rum notwithstanding that it is the product of black labour. </para>

              <para>- At any rate, the Ottawa agreement has left the door open for the importation into Australia of rum from the West Indies produced by black-sweated labour. Australian brandy enjoys a marginal difference of 18s. a gallon over imported brandy, and gin and whisky have an advantage of 17s. a gallon. In the case of rum, however, the marginal difference is only 6s. a gallon. Those rates give an unfair preference to the other spirits, and place rum at a disadvantage. Queensland is the only place in the world in. which rum is produced by white labour. Not only the rum itself, but also every ingredient used in its manufacture in Australia is produced by white labour. I hope that the committee will agree to the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown.</inline></para>

          <para>The object of my request is to provide for a differentiation of1s. 6d. per lb. between the excise rate on tobacco made from imported leaf and that on tobacco made from Australian-grown leaf. The Minister in charge of the bill denied that there was any moral obligation on the present Government to the Australian tobacco-growers because of what was done by the Scullin Government.. Let me draw a parallel to show that the Minister was wrong. Suppose one Government encouraged migration on a large scale, and a succeeding government, opposed to migration, sought to wash its hands of all responsibility with regard to those migrants who had been encouraged to come to Australia. Would the Minister say that the succeeding government had no moral obligation in the matter? The more we study the history of tobacco-growing in Australia, and the sudden expansion of the industry in recent years, the more convinced we become that a great deal of the development - I do not say all of it - was due to the Scullin tariff. The Minister smiles, and he reminds me of the "smile on the face of the tiger". No doubt, he will claim that the Scullin duties were in operation only for a limited number of months; but even that was sufficient to cause a tremendous number of primary producers and others to take up tobacco-growing. It is easy to perceive what has happened by noting the development of the industry, even in my own district. It has been said that an excise duty of 3s. a lb. affords ample protection to the growers. The Minister has declared, without hesitation, "It is 300 per cent, protection ". How did he arrive at that figure? The average price paid to the growers last year was from 2s. to 2s. 3d. per lb., and the import duty . to-day amounts to 3s. per lb. The Minister has said repeatedly . - and the statement is also made in the Tariff Board's report - that the protection afforded to this industry amounts to 300 per cent.; but how can that be so when the average price realized last year for 8,000,000 lb. of the Australian crop was about 2s. 3d. per lb. Taking the difference between that price and the import duty of 3s. per lb., the protection amounts to only 50 per cent. </para>
          <para>I realize that the Government will win or lose, on this issue, on the ground that the revenue- would suffer if the excise were lowered. I anticipate that certain honorable senators who represent primary producing States are not prepared  to support my request. They say, " We must not interfere with the revenue required by the Government ". The revenue received from tobacco in 1932-33 amounted to £7,300,000 ; but the Government did not budget for that amount. It planned to receive from that source only £6,100,000. What right  ha3  the Government to extract from those who use tobacco an additional £1,212,988? In view of the estimate of £6,100,000, it cannot be contended that a reduction of the excise on Australian leaf to 3s. per lb., thus reducing the revenue for 1933-34 to £6,600,000 odd, would greatly embarrass the Government. The position of the tobacco-growers of Australia is serious, because 4,000 or more of them are faced with ruin. The Government claims that their deplorable position is due to an act of <inline font-style="italic">Goi</inline> ; but we have, to consider the price they will get for their diminished crop, and the bigger that price is the better chance they will' have of recovering from the set-back they have received through bad seasonal conditions. Taking the industry as a whole, I think that it may be said that the season just past was the worst that has been experienced by the growers. I submit my request for the reason that the year's revenue will not be affected by it for more than three months, and also on cbe ground of justice, because the high duties previously imposed encouraged the growers to invest their small savings in growing tobacco leaf. The Government might well give them a fighting chance of success until the industry gets safely upon its feet. </para>

            <para>.- Since February, 1932, no fewer than 23 schemes have been submitted to the Government for the revision of these duties on tobacco, and each would have involved the sacrifice of very substantial amounts of revenue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy's</inline> proposal is for a differentiation in the excise. The specious plea has been advanced that the purpose is to cheapen tobacco to the Australian smoker, but it is in reality nothing more than an en deavour to obtain greater protection for an industry which is already highly protected. It is true that, for the last year, the total revenue derived from narcotics increased substantially, and is about £800,000 above the amount of £6,500,000 which the Tariff Board suggested should be obtained from tobacco during the period in which the Australian leafgrowing, industry was becoming established. However, an analysis of the position shows that this additional revenue has not been obtained at the expense of the leaf -growing industry. The additional revenue has been obtained as follows: - </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="141332193306146_33_2.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para>Thus, out of the increase of £830,000 which has come about in the revenue, only £232,000, or 28 per cent., is borne by the Australian smoker of locally-grown leaf. This, fact is very important, and puts a vastly different complexion on the board's statement with regard to the limitation of revenues on narcotics, so that the Government cannot take the basic figure of £6,500,,000 as being a fair comparison. </para>
          <para>It must also be borne in mind that the increased revenue returns will not be maintained when increased quantities of Australian leaf go into consumption. The duties encouraged manufacturers to place the Australian leaf into maturation instead of immediate consumption, and this  i3  all to the good. If the rates had not encouraged maturation, it is certain greater quantities of Australian leaf would have been marketed last year, and revenue returns would not have been nearly so great. Although an immediate increase in revenue is being experienced, the ultimate result will be a loss of revenue, as the crop of 11,000,000 lb. of Australian leaf which was produced, purchased, and placed into maturation last year,, is gradually released and placed on  the market. ' For every pound so used, 3s. impart duty will be lost. </para>
          <para>On next year's budgeted usings, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy's</inline> proposal for a reduction of1s. 6d. per lb. on tobacco manufactured from Australian leaf would involve a loss of £323,000. As the very . object of his request is to ensure a greater use of Australian- leaf, it is apparent that the loss would be much greater than this. If a swing-over to 1,000,000 lb. of Australian stemmed leaf, additional to that budgeted for, occurred, the loss would be £560,674. If a swing-over to 2,000,000 lb. of Australian leaf occurred, the loss would be £798,424; if 3,000,000 lb., it would be £1,036,174. These figures indicate how our carefully planned finances could be so easily wrecked. </para>
          <para>Honorable senators might consider these calculations somewhat academic, but that they are very real and practical. Quite early after, the changed duties were brought down in February, 1932, growers'  representatives, and others interested, said that the department was in error in estimating that year's Australian crop at from 10,000,000 lb. to 11,000,000 lb. The growers' estimate was 6,000,000 lb. The actual crop was 13,000,000 lb. And so with these revenue figures the department advised the previous Government that its proposed amendments would defeat themselves. At that time, revenue from tobacco was £6,500,000 per annum. The previous Government decided that it wanted another £1,000,000 from tobacco. It never got it. Instead, it received £6,300,000. Diminished consumption was not the sole reason. The point which was overlooked by the last Government was that the time had arrived when increased excise duties had to be imposed in order to maintain the revenue, let alone the securing of an additional £1,000.000. </para>
          <para>The present duties on tobacco are fixed at such a level as will permit the industry to develop along sound, economic lines, and, at the same time, ensure that the revenue will be maintained. The granting of further protection, either by an increased duty on imported leaf, or by a reduction of excise on Australian leaf, would mean that the production of darker  grades of leaf, for which there is only a limited demand, would be reverted to, and the industry would relapse into that chaotic condition from which it was rescued last year. Any sincere claim for additional protection of Australian-grown leaf must start from the point that Australian growers are not obtaining satisfactory prices. No evidence has been submitted to prove this. Last year's prices were exceedingly satisfactory, and all the crop was sold. This year's results of auction sales were also very satisfactory, as the following figures show:- </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="141332193306146_34_0.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para class="block">It is evident that every pound of good quality tobacco leaf produced in Australia finds a ready and profitable market. If some growers persist in growing dark leaf, and do not sell it, the manufacturers cannot be blamed, nor can the Government be held responsible. In the final analysis, the smoker is the person who insists upon the production of quality tobacco. His taste must  be respected, and no organization of growers, nor the Government, can balk this fact. </para>
          <para>Finally, no Government can afford to lose hundreds of thousands of pounds in revenue to assist growers who do not produce the class of tobacco demanded by Australian smokers. If this request is agreed to, revenue will undoubtedly be lost. Tobacco is regarded as one of those commodities which may legitimately be taxed by governments for revenue purposes, and if the honorable senator's proposal is accepted, other primary producers, who are more deserving, may have to suffer. The increase in the production of tobacco in Australia has, in many instances, been responsible for unduly inflating land values. Tobacco-growing is the most profitable primary industry in Australia. </para>

              <para>- I have the figures for last year in my possession. Growers, of course, have to contend with climatic conditions and pests, but the  returns  of many growers have been highly satisfactory. If the excise duties are reduced, the result in Australia may be as it was in the United States of America. In the early stages of tobacco growing the producers in that country were asked to contribute a fair share to the revenue, but there was such a clamour that they escaped paying their fair quota, and, even to-day, the revenue derived from tobacco in the United States of America, as compared with that received from other sources, is lower than it should be. I shall oppose the request in the interests of the tobacco-growing industry, because I believe that in doing so I shall be assisting to place it on an economic basis. </para>

            <para>. - I would not have spoken but for the extravagant and inaccurate statements of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan).</inline> When replying to the debate on the second reading of the bill he said that the Australian tobacco growers enjoy a protection of 300 per cent. They enjoy no such protection. What are the actual facts? The manufacturer of imported tobacco has to pay about ls. per lb. to land the leaf in Australia, and a customs duty of 3s. per lb., making a total cost of 4s. per lb. to cover the cost of the raw material and customs duty. To that is added a flat rate of excise of 4s. 6d. per lb., making the total cost of the raw material and customs and excise duties 83. 6d. per lb. On the other hand, what has the Australian manufacturer to pay for the right to manufacture and market Australian tobacco? The average price of Australian tobacco last year was 2s. 3d. per lb., but to that we have to add an excise duty of 4s. 6d. per lb., making a total of 6s. 9d. per lb. for raw material and excise duty. The difference between 8s. 6d. per lb. and 6s. 9d. per lb is not 300 per cent., as the Minister stated, but only 33 per cent. </para>

              <para>- It is the only basis upon which it can be argued. Before, one ounce of imported or Australian tobacco can be sold the manufacturer has to buy the leaf and pay the customs and excise duties imposed by this Parliament. The only protection that the Australian tobacco-grower enjoys is approximately 33 per cent. But granted that the Minister's figures are correct, what have he and the officers of the Customs Department been doing to permit manufacturers to charge the prices they do? I have found it difficult to obtain Australian tobacco, but I have tried three different kinds and found that it compares favorably with the imported leaf. The actual difference in the retail price of imported and Australian tobacco is id. per oz. Where does the 300 per cent, come in? I believe that the quality of Australian tobacco is equal, if not superior, to the imported. I have been informed by experts that the peculiar properties of certain tobacco which make it more palatable to some smokers are due to the soil in which it is grown, and also to the climate in which it is produced. Twelve months ago when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Dickson,</inline> the Commonwealth tobacco expert, delivered a most interesting lecture on tobacco in the Senate club room, he said that even if we imported the best tobacco plants from overseas and adopted overseas cultural methods, we could not produce tobacco with the same aroma as the imported leaf owing to the difference in soil and climate. Australian smokers have become accustomed to the taste and aroma of the imported tobacco, and the only way to encourage them to smoke Australian-grown leaf is by reducing the price of the Australian product. The proposals of this Government, unlike those of the previous Government, will not assist in that direction. I support the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy.</inline></para>

            <para>.- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> stated, a few minutes ago, that between the time of the alteration of the duty and the present day, 23 different schemes for the assistance of the industry had been submitted to the Government for consideration. Bearing in mind that there are approximately 4,000 tobacco growers in the various States, the fact that they had presented to the Government the number of proposals mentioned by the Minister is very definite evidence of discontent and dissatisfaction with the Government's action in increasing excise and reducing import duties. Notwithstanding the subtle arguments advanced this afternoon by the Minister, and other attempts to camouflage the position, it cannot bedenied that Australian tobacco growers have been, and will continue to be penalized so long as the present impost of 7s. 6d. per lb. remains on foreign-grown tobacco, and the excise on the Australian product is 4s.6d. instead of 2s. 4d. per lb. That is tie position in a nutshell. It is of no use for the Minister to endeavour to side-step the issue. The reason for the lament of Australian tobacco-growers is that they know that the present duties will not encourage manufacturers to buy their product.. The Minister has repeatedly stated that it is the intention of the Government to encourage tobacco growing. Apparently its relation to the industry is that of a foster-parent to his child. If this correctly describes the relationship, and if this 93 per cent, increase of the excise duty represents the initiative of the Government on behalf of the growers, we cannot blame them if they look upon the Government as an anaemic scarecrow that is patiently awaiting decent burial. </para>

The position of the Labour party throughout this tariff debate in the Senate has been quite hopeless. All its requests have been unsuccessful. </para>

            <para>. -  I rise to discuss this question only because of the provocative speech of the Minister. It cannot be said that honorable senators on this side have obtruded unduly into the debate to-day, the reason being that they have been aware of the desire to complete the business. </para>

          <para>The Minister said that if care were not exercised, the tobacco industry would destroy itself, because it would proceed along wrong lines and not produce the quality of leaf required. In reply, I point out that the Queensland Government is sending out its instructors among the tobacco-growers, to advise them exactly as to what to do and what not to do, what to expect and what to avoid, in regard to seed, cultivation methods, and other factors. </para>
          <para>The Minister also said that one of the unsatisfactory results of the encouragement given to the industry by the Scullin tariff was speculation in land values. That suggestion can be dismissed with a lordly wave of the hand, similar to that with which the Minister dismissed all the difficulties of the industry. That honorable gentleman and his party stand for the exploitation of land values and of everything else out of which profit may be made, and never' in any circumstances have a word to say against the practice. "We who sit on this side do not stand for the exploitation of land values. We believe in 'the land tax, which the Government has already promised it will take off the backs of ite wealthy friends. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator SAMPSON</inline>(Tasmania) £4.33]. - During the last twelve months, we have been inundated with literature explaining the pros and cons of the tobacco industry. Those of us who represent States in which tobacco is no't grown to any extent - in Tasmania it  ha3  been grown for many years, but not in any quantity - may be regarded as outsiders or spectators who, it is generally believed, " see most of the game." The study of Tariff Board reports and the different statements put out by tobacco-growing associations and other bodies, is rather informative. 'Some interesting statements have been made during the course of this debate. "On the one hand it has been said that the tobacco-grower is threatened with industrial extinction, and that he is &amp;t present scratching along almost on the breadline. On the other hand, it has been said that he has been on a very good wicket in a most profitable occupation. It it most difficult to reconcile those statements. I' believe that there is not the slightest doubt that last year and the year before, a largs number of persons were tempted by the profitable returns to grow tobacco. Then, the problem of marketing arose. I think it can be said that it was the definite policy of the Australian manufacturers last year - and that it still is - to use Australian leaf to the greatest possible extent. That is proved by the appreciable variation that has occurred in the quality of well-known brands of tobacco, due to the fact that a fairly large proportion of not quite suitable leaf has been mixed with the imported leaf. Consistent smokers must have noticed that variation. I have been a smoker for 30 odd years, and during the last twelve months, I have had to chop and change among the different brands. Some Australian tobacco is excellent, some is fair, and some is perfectly horrible. That, of course, applies also to tobacco grown in other countries. For six or seven years, I lived in Rhodesia, where I attempted to grow tobacco. The problem in that country has been the marketing of what is not  first-grade leaf. The Australian manufacturer has used a large proportion of Australian leaf; but there are limits to 'its use.', The ultimate success of both  the  growing and the . manufacturing, branches of the industry in Australia rests- with the smoker, about whom we have not heard much during this debate. The quality of the tobacco marketed must be so high that it will be palatable to him. The Government could, of course, follow the lead given by France and other countries, and permit only certain tobacco to be smoked; but God forbid that wi should ever be placed in that position! The less said about the quality of the government monopoly tobacco in France, the better. The Australian industry is more or less in "the experimental stage. Tobaccogrowing must be undertaken in areas that are suitable in regard to both soil and climatic conditions. I have carefully read the case put up to the Government, the reports of the Tariff Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Dickson's</inline> statements, and anything else dealing with tobacco that I have been able to lay my hands on during the last twelve months. If one believed the statements of those who are opposed to the Government in this matter, one could only come to the conclusion that it is stark, staring mad; that it has no intelligence, brains or sense. Can it be said that the Tariff Board is absolutely ' mad, and that it has acted stupidly? The principal thing to be avoided in this industry is overproduction,' particularly of leaf that is not suitable for smoking purposes. A tremendous percentage of the crop comes under that head. If we had a big glut' of poor quality leaf, we should be in the same position as Rhodesia occupied in 1928, when it could hardy  give away 19,000,000 lb. of leaf on account of the poorness of its quality. Even if we over-produced leaf of excellent quality we should have the utmost difficulty in disposing of it. We certainly have an over-production of sugar, but its quality is, probably, better than that of any other sugar. If we continued to do as we did last year in the tobacco industry, we should be landed with an overproduction of leaf of varying qualities, of which we could not possibly dispose, and the last stage of the Australian tobacco industry would be much worse than the first. I have endeavoured, after full consideration of the facts, to arrive at a fair and proper appreciation of the matter, my conclusion being that; I must support the action/of the. Government. </para>

            <para>. - I was astonished at the novel method enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' O'Halloran</inline> of calculating the amount of protection which an industry receives. I do not know how it was arrived at, nor, do I think, does anybody else, including the honorable senator. The position that he makes out is that the manufacturer has to pay 3s. per lb. for imported leaf, the landing cost of which is approximately ls. per lb., which makes a total of 43. prior to manufacture. The manufacturer hae to pay an average of 2s. 3d. per lb. for Australian leaf, so that, on the honorable senator's figures, the margin represents a difference of ls. 9d. on a pound of leaf which costs under ls. - a protection of about 17-5 per cent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> has advanced the theory that, certain persons having been induced to embark upon the industry of tobacco-growing by imposing extravagantly high duties, the Government is now under an obligation to carry them in future. I regret that I cannot accept that as being the duty of the Government. Persons who embark upon any industry are obliged to take ordinary precautions. Growers knew that the tariff could be altered, and were aware of the conditions under which the Scullin schedule was imposed. I am sick and tired of explaining that it is not a tariff, but a resolution that was laid on the table of another place by one, Francis Michael Forde, under which the Government proceeded to collect the duties which it provided. If it is to become the duty of the Government to afford protection to sections of the community against their errors of judgment, I do not know where the thing is to end. </para>

        <para class="block">I propose also to move a similar request to sub-item  b,  which relates to manufactured tobacco. The purpose of these requests is to establish a margin between the duties chargeable on Australian leaf and imported leaf respectively. This proposal is identical with one submitted in the* House of Representatives by the Acting Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson).</inline> The fact that it was rejected in that chamber by only two votes shows that it had the approval of a large proportion of those who have taken a deep interest in the Australian tobacco-growing industry. The purpose is primarily to assist the growers of tobacco by providing an incentive to smokers to use Australian-grown leaf. It is a question of deciding how a cheaper smoke can be provided for the man who has been hit hy the depression, without causing a loss of revenue to the Government. We believe that th a t -can be done. The secretary of the Victorian Tobacco Growers Association has submitted a proposal which would permit Australian tobacco to be sold for Id.  less  per 2-oz. packet than the present price, and for blended tobacco to be sold at rates ranging from those now charged to slightly lower prices. That would increase the difference in price that now exists between Australian and imported tobacco &lt;o at least 1½d. for a 2-oz. packet, and would give a considerable incentive to smokers 'Jo acquire a taste for Australian tobacco. It would also lessen the difficulties associated with the disposal of Australian leaf. I shall not traverse the ground already well covered by Senators Hardy, 0'Halloran. and others; but I submit that the resultant loss of revenue from the adoption of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy's</inline> proposal would be much less than the estimate of the Minister. My .proposal is for a very much smaller alteration than that desired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy.</inline> The maximum drop in the revenue which the adoption of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy's</inline> proposal would cause would be about £300,000, not allowing for the increased consumption of tobacco which would ensue from the cheapening of this commodity. In times of depression, men are forced to place a limit on their use of luxuries. That the cheapening of a commodity in general use always increases the consumption of that commodity has been proved many times in the case of bread; as the price has fallen, so has the consumption increased. We have, therefore, to deduct from the possible losses the additional revenue which would be derived from the greater quantity of tobacco consumed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> in a rather cold-blooded manner, sard that persons who invested their cash on the strength of action taken by a government through the customs house, accepted the attendant risk with their eyes open, because they 'knew that a future government could alter the duties. I dissent altogether from that view. While it must be admitted that governmental aid is a purely artificial way of stimulating industry, there can be no justification whatever for giving a sudden impetus to a new enterprise, and then bringing down the axe on it just as suddenly. Any such action must necessarily dislocate industry and destroy confidence in governments. As a general rule, one government feels bound by any undertaking entered into by its predecessor, even when that undertaking is not backed by statute law. I know that there are exceptions to  that  rule, but  'Other  than in special circumstances it is followed. Ordinarily, we have no more right to induce people to embark on an enterprise, and then suddenly to withdraw the support given to them, than we have to borrow money under false pretences. I contend that, whatever difficulties there may be in the way of producting a high-class tobacco leaf, because of attemps to grow it in unsuitable soil, or in districts not climatically suited to its culture, the fact remains that a large proportion of the land now under tobacco is well suited to the production of high-class leaf. This industry is, therefore, not one which can be dismissed, with a shrug of the shoulders, as being of no account. On the contrary, it is an industry in which a considerable amount of capital has been invested, and the adoption of any policy which might plunge the greater number of those engaged in tobacco production into financial difficulties would be a scandalous thing to "do. A good case has been made out on behalf of the tobacco growers, who were induced by previous administrations to engage in this form of production. Moreover, in these times of depression, smokers are entitled to a better deal than they are now getting. They should be offered some inducement to acquire a taste for Australian tobacco. It is useless to argue that, if Australian tobacco were of first-class quality, smokers would be glad to smoke it without any special inducement. Quality is largely a matter of individual taste. A person who, over a period of years, </para>
        <para class="block">Las acquired a taste for a certain commodity, is not easily persuaded that another commodity is equally good. The way in which we can best help the tobacco-grower is to increase the demand for his product; and, if he is given a margin of protection over the foreign grower such as I propose, it will enable the locally-grown tobacco to be  Bold  at a price slightly lower than that of the imported tobacco, and therefore stimulate its consumption. A logical case has been made out on behalf of the Australian growers. This impost . should be permanent, but as the demand for the Australian tobacco increases, and that of the imported correspondingly diminishes, there should bo a readjustment between the customs and excise duties so as to suit the changing circumstances. I trust that the committee will agree to my request </para>

I saw the first tariff schedule put through, and all subsequent schedules, but never before has such close attention been given to any schedule in the Senate as has been given to this. Both sides of the Senate will agree with me, I am sure, in expressing our appreciation of the way in which the presiding officers, and the  Chairman  of Committees, have performed their duties, as also have the members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff and other officials during the strain  of the session.

The  Chairman  of Committees and the officers of the Senate have performed their duties in a most praiseworthy manner. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> who has piloted the bill through the Senate has at all times been most courteous and considerate, and has never hesitated to give the fullest information on all subjects, even to those who <inline font-style="italic">frere,</inline> for the time being, opposed to him. He is a colleague of mine from South Australia, and, therefore, it is perhaps not fitting for me to praise him too highly, but I feel that I must express my personal' appreciation, and that of my party, for his assistance to all honorable senators during the tariff debate. To the customs officers who assisted the Minister, the best thanks of the Senate are due, as also to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and those associated with them in the" compilation of the permanent record of proceedings. The manner in which the Senate has dealt with this tariff schedule has enormously increased its prestige.

        <para>I now desire to refer to the negotiations in which the Resident Minister in London <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> is at present engaged on behalf of the Australian Government with respect to the restric tion of wheat-producing acreage.  A  number of contradictory newspaper reports have been published in Australia during the last two or three weeks from which it is difficult to gather the actual lines upon which the World Economic Conference is proceeding. I realize that the Government is in an extremely delicate position, and I am not going to criticize the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> for  tha  meagre nature of the information conveyed to honorable senators. But I desire to utter a warning to the Government because this is the last opportunity that we shall have, at least for a brief period, to speak on behalf of the respective States and of the wheat-grower* of Australia generally, as to the consequences which may accrue from the adoption of an agreement which may not be considered in every detail. In this respect I call to my assistance no less a personage than the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker),</inline> a former Minister in the present Government. In discussing the proposals to limit the export of wheat from Australia, at a pleasant Sunday afternoon gathering held in Maughan Church, in Adelaide, on Sunday last, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hawker</inline> made the following declaration :- </para>
        <quote>
          <para>To ask Australia to join in a conspiracy to stint the hungry so that she and other wheat-exporting countries may obtain higher prices for their wheat from people -who are already well fed seems to me to be entirely wrong in principle. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hawker.</inline>  The adoption of such a proposal would mean stinting the hungry, not only in other countries, but also in Australia unless some mean* is provided to compensate the farmers in this country for the wheat they would not be permitted to sell without imposing an additional burden on the consumers of bread in Australia. I was perturbed in reading a paragraph in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> this morning, in which it is suggested that Canada favours a restriction of wheat acreage and wheat export. I do not believe in a restriction of acreage or df export, but according to the paragraph in the newspaper mentioned, it is proposed to overcome this difficulty by an international plan. The individual grower would be under no restriction as regards acreage and production, but the  maximum quantity he could market from any crop would he fixed and the balance would be left entirely on his hands. That may appeal to Canadian growers. I have some knowledge of the conditions existing in the wheat-growing areas of Australia, and the idea of leaving marketable wheat on the hands of the average Australian farmer is anathema to me. In the. Commonwealth we have two kinds of wheat-growing districts. We have safe districts where farmers can produce wheat almost any season because the rainfall, soil and other natural conditions are admirably suited for its production. In other districts tremendous areas have been developed at great expense by State governments concerned, where rainfall is doubtful, and where other important factors enter into consideration. In these districts frequent failures are experienced in the growing of cereals. I ask the Government that all these matters shall lie seriously considered. In South Australia we have what is known as the fringe country, comprising 13,000,000 acres of land which produces probably one crop in three years. On Eyre's Peninsula, which has been described as South Australia's new province, there is a tremendous area of land which has been developed at great expense to the State, but where the rainfall and other conditions are such that periodical failures occur; If restrictions are to be imposed full consideration must be given to all these factors and their possible influence upon the finances of not only individual farmers, but also the State governments concerned. I urge that the most serious consideration be given to the matter before any final agreement is entered into by the Resident Minister in London on behalf of the Government. I recall our unhappy experience under the Ottawa agreement, which this Parliament was practically forced to ratify. I do not wish a similar set. of conditions to occur so that there shall be any restriction on the planting of wheat or of its export from Australia. </para>

          <para>.- On behalf of the members of the Country party in this chamber, I join in the expressions of appreciation which have been extended to you, sir, for the way in which you have presided over our deliberations, and also to the  Chairman  of Committees and the officials of the House, including the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. This is the first tariff schedule which <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Herbert</inline> Hays has handled as  Chairman  of Committees, and I think that we all agree that he has carried out his work with conspicuous ability and fairness. Members of the Country party also desire to thank sincerely the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan),</inline> who piloted through the Senate the very comprehensive tariff which has just been disposed of,, for his unfailing courtesy and good temper, and for the fund of information which he always had at his disposal. Although we opposed the Government on many items, and endeavoured unsuccessfully to carry requests for lower duties, we appreciate the good spirit which ,the Minister showed throughout the debate, and thank him for his courtesy to us, even when we were attacking the Government. </para>

          <para>. - Speaking for myself and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> who constitutes the " rank and file," but who is also  deputy  leader of the Lang Labour party in this chamber, I offer thanks to my dear friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays, who, as  Chairman  of Committees, so patiently watched over the tariff debate during the last six weeks, when all honorable senators were dealing out their political " patter ". Being politicians, I suppose we all display, at times, evidence of the ego that is in us. Even you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> on one or two occasions succeeded in getting in your little bit of " patter ", some of it secondhand, on behalf of the people of Western Australia. It was, I think, significant that, in the discussion of this main schedule, we ended on the item, " goods, second-hand ". Possibly, after a weary tariff debate, lasting more than six weeks, the majority of honorable senators were in what might be termed a second-hand frame of mind, and were glad to end the discussion. I join with the right honorable the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> the  Deputy  Leader of the Labour party <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Halloran),</inline> and the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Johnston),</inline> in thanking the Minister and all the Senate officers, as well a3 members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, for their assistance. I include, also, representatives of one of our national institutions, the members of the press gallery. In newspaper parlance, these press " bird* " have been sitting in the gallery above us, daily watching over our deliberations, accepting and publishing, from time to time, those contributions of political chaff which they considered worth recording in the press of  this  country. To our fellow slaves in the pres3 gallery, I give my thanks for the many little kindnesses they have shown tO' us. </para>

        <para>I understand that the right honorable the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has returned to Canberra from Sydney, and I should like to know if the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> ha3 any information to give with regard to the recent application by the Blue Star line of steamers to share the Australian overseas trade with vessels included in the Overseas Transport Association, about which there has been some argument of late. The addition of vessels of the Blue Star line to that trade will, I believe, be of material benefit to our primary producers; but, judging by reports that have appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald^</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily,</inline> and. other 'newspapers, it would seem that the shipping companies connected with 'the overseas- shipping ring, have formed what may be called a mercantile KuKluxKlan. They object to. ships belonging to other companies taking part in the trade, because of the possibility of rebates in freights being demanded. Every consideration should be given to the proposal made by the Blue Star line for permission to enter the 'magic circle' that has been built around Australia's oversea trade. I understand that a deputation representing the Blue Star line interests will wait on the Prime Minister on Tuesday next, and I should like to know if the Loader of the Senate can indicate what the Government proposes to do in this matter. </para>

I also express my thanks to honorable senators for their consideration and courtesy, and desire to pay a tribute to the  Clerk  and Clerk-Assistant of the Senate for the valuable assistance which they rendered to me throughout the long discussion, which ended this afternoon. During the last five weeks I have had many opportunities to observe the thoroughness with which  these officers discharged their duties, and the smoothness with which the tariff debate was conducted was due largely to their attention, to all the details of their work, which, I may add, begins before the Senate assembles, and continues for some time after it adjourns. </para>

I agree with my leader, whose expression of opinion was echoed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran,</inline> that the examination by honorable senators of the many tariff items was very minute indeed - far too much so for my comfort, I may say, for while I prepared myself for the criticism which I expected would be directed against certain of the items, and tried to anticipate the various heads under which discussion would develop, I overlooked the possibility of a close examination of the 1921-30 tariff rates. If, therefore, I stumbled over some of the fences, I am sure that honorable senators will forgive me. This was my first experience of tariff-making. Doubtless, honorable senators will expect me to say that I hope it will be my last, but I am afraid that I must disappoint them. At the moment I have no such wish. I desire to thank the  Chairman  of Committees <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Herbert Hays)</inline> and the  Clerk  and ClerkAssistant, who were always anxious to helD me,, and by their advice, greatly facilitated the passage of the tariff. </para>

A substantial rise in the price of wheat would help the industry, and we should not be backward in accepting any reasonable scheme that would attain that end. </para>

During the regime of the Scullin Administration, this body was given some sort of recognition by an alteration of the Australian Industries Preservation Act and a shipping committee was set up. The question of the Blue Star Line being admitted to membership of the association is one, not for the Government, but for the association itself. </para>

        <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">PRESIDENT (Senator the Hoa. P. J. Lynch).</inline> - It is worth while to have lived through the last six weeks of strongly contrasting viewpoints, and the clashing of opinions, and to arrive at the stage at which the dominant note is harmony of the best type. That should be the position in a free democracy; because it must be recognized that there are as many opinions held in regard to the proper control and government of a country as there are brands of tea. So long as one generously acknowledges the right of one's fellows' to hold a different opinion with freedom equal to one's own, so long will the spirit of goodwill, tact, and tolerance prevail. </para>
        <para>I heartily agree with all that has been said concerning the conduct of the business of the Senate, but disclaim any right to share in the praise that has been bestowed. I have lived in the reflection of the light shed by the  Chairman  of Committees, upon whose shoulders has rested the major portion of the work. For a beginner, the honorable gentleman has discharged his duties with courtesy and uncommon efficiency, and has given satisfaction to all interests, even when tha flashpoint has been most brilliant. Snob an achievement betokens the possession of rare qualities. </para>
        <para>I have not had the experience of the Leader of the Senate, but I can say that the manner in which the tariff has been handled on the present occasion compares more than favorably with the circumstances that have attended the passage of any previous tariff with which I have had the privilege of being associated. The whole' tariff, and not a part of it only, was dealt with, and linked up with it were considerations affecting affairs in other parts of the Empire, whereas former tariffs have involved only the less complex aspect of Australian affairs. Needless to say, that has made the work of handling this tariff much more arduous and painstaking. </para>
        <para>The officers of the Senate have, as usual, fulfilled expectations by having performed their duties with efficiency, courtesy, and conscientious endeavour. In that, they have achieved the double purpose of having satisfied themselves, and, at the same time, harmonized the opposing views of honorable senators. I wish honorable senators the best that fortune can place in their hands. </para>
