        <para>Addressing a meeting of the council of the Miners&#39; Federation yesterday, the  president  of the western miners <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Campbell Roy),</inline> condemned the Federal Government for its alleged failure to develop the shale oil deposits of the State. </para>
        <para>He complained that although reports had been submitted to the Minister in charge of Development (SenatorMcLachlan ) by the shale oil committee, no action had been taken. &#34; Rumours are current that the Government is refraining from developing this Australian enterprise until shortly before the next federal elections,&#34; said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Campbell</inline> Roy. &#34;The Government should realize that hundreds of miners in the western district have been unemployed for a considerable time, and should not be made the plaything of politicians.&#34; </para>

They indicate the work that has been done and the nature of the inquiries being made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> J. Rogers overseas. It is hoped that a full report will be made available after Mr.Rogers&#39; return to Australia on the 4th November. So far as the Government is concerned, the development of the Newnes shale oil deposits is not a political matter. It is the wish of the Government to have the project developed onsound lines in. order that, if the work is resumed, it will be on a permanent basis. </para>

            <para>- I shall consider the advisability of taking honorable senators into my confidence; but the difficulty is that although one day favorable reports may be received regarding work that is being done in England, later detailed advices may show that the earlier reports painted rather too glowing a picture of the prospects. My desire is to give to honorable senators as much information as possible and to tell them exactly what is the position as Mr.Rogers and the Newnes Shale Oil Investigation Committee see it. When the time is opportune, I shall be only too pleased to disclose all the information available. </para>

          <para>. I understand from the Minister in charge of the bill that Judge Lukin is to be the judge of this court. Is he to be paid a separate salary for this work? He is already drawing a pension from the State of Queensland as a retired judge, and he is also paid for his services as judge of the Commonwealth Bankruptcy Court. In such circumstances, even if he is not to receive an additional salary as judge of the Supreme Court in Canberra, it would be wrong to give another job to this gentleman. Some other judge should be appointed. </para>

          <para>. - I do not propose to reflect on judge Lukin as a man, or as a barrister or a judge, and I remember that I am indebted to a member of his family. That fact, however, does not prevent me from voicing what the people of Queensland, and, indeed, of Australia generally, regard as a grievance, namely, that a&#39; judge who has been retired from the Queensland judiciary on  the  substantial pension of &#163;1,000 a year, should afterwards be appointed a judge by the Commonwealth  Government  and paid a handsome salary from the Commonwealth. Now he is to be appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of the Territory for the Seat of Government. I do not say that Judge Lukin is not an  able  judge; but why should he be appointed to  this  position and allowed to continue in it when  there  are numbers of capable barristers in the country practically  unemployed?  I am as  much  opposed to a superannuated judge being appointed to  such  a position as I would be to the appointment of a superannuated journalist to a position which could as  well be filled by an unemployed member of the profession. Unfortunately, 25 per cent, of the workers of Australia are still unemployed notwithstanding the Government&#39;s claim that during its term of office unemployment has decreased. I hope that the many members of the Barrister&#39;s Union on the Government side will support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> and myself in protesting against the appointment of Judge Lukin to this position. </para>

          <para>. - It is necessary that any judge who may be appointed to exercise the judicial powers of the Commonwealth shall have a life tenure. Consequently, if a judge were appointed solely for the Supreme Court of the Territory for the Seat of Government, he would have to be given a life tenure, and I assume a reasonable salary also, notwithstanding that he would be called upon to exercise his judicial functions probably only once or twice a year in Canberra. No doubt the Government recognized that fact when it decided to designate for this work a judge who already enjoys a life tenure. I was not aware that the Minister said yesterday that Judge Lukin would be asked to undertake this work, and while not wishing to make comparisons, I would say that, of those available, no one has had a wider experience or is more fitted to undertake the duties of the office, than he is. I shall not enter into a discussion with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacDonald</inline> regarding the wisdom or otherwise of appointing to this position a judge who already draws a pension from the Queensland Government, and is in receipt of a salary from the Commonwealth Government, because that question does not now arise. I am somewhat surprised that the honorable senator has failed to realize that this appointment really means that Judge Lukin will do more work for the same salary. </para>

It is an omnibus clause to enable the court to grant relief in cases where it appears that the parties are entitled to relief, and is designed to avoid multiplicity of actions. Its purpose is to make the order of the court final and put an end to disputes and differences between the parties, which otherwise might be the subject of fresh litigation. </para>

          <para>. - This clause appears to give a great deal of power to a single judge who will preside over this court, though it provides that all rules of court shall be notified in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and copies forwarded to the Attorney-General within fourteen days. There is the further provision that the Attorney-General may, by notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> disallow any rule of court, and thereupon the rule so disallowed shall cease to have effect. There ought to be some right in this Parliament, as in the case of regulations made by other lawmaking bodies, to disallow a rule of the court made under this legislation. The provision in its present form entrusts to the Attorney-General exclusively the right of modifying a law, because that is what, in effect, all rules of court will be, and I suggest that the right of disallowance should be vested in the Parliament. No single judge in any Australian court has the power to make rules. </para>

          <para>. - Ordinarily, the rulemaking power is exercised, not by an individual judge, but by the bench of a particular State or the full bench of the High Court. This provision is certainly a departure from the existing practice in the States, but it should be remembered that there will be only one judge exercising jurisdiction at the Seat of Government. While the rule-making power is limited, it is tolerably wide and rules cannot be altered by the Parliament except by special legislation introduced for that purpose. I realize how undesirable it is that the disallowance of these rules should be in the hands of a single individual, but I remind the honorable senator that the Attorney-General will be exercising a judicial and not a political power, and that the intention is to use this power as a speedy means of dealing with rules that might operate harshly or improperly. As we are embarking upon a new jurisdiction, I suggest that the committee should allow the provision to stand. In view of the fact that the power to make rules will be vested in one judge, whereas in the States it is exercised by the full bench, the Attorney-General believes that there should be the power of disallowance for whichthe clause provides. </para>

A number of men were recently tried at Newcastle, New South Wales, on charges of being participants in an alleged riot at Tighe&#39;s Hill. The case occasioned considerable stir, and the hearing extended over many weeks, some of the alleged participants being found not guilty. The venue of the trial was then moved to Singleton, 35 or 36 miles distant, the reason given for this action being that the accused worked on the industrial fields of Newcastle, and that the case was going badly against the Crown. It was thought that by changing the venue of the trial the Crown would be able to obtain convictions. </para>

          <para>. -  This clause refers only to a change of venue in reference to suits, and &#34;suit&#34; is defined in the bill as including &#34; any action or original proceeding between parties of a civil nature&#34;. Section 25 of the High Court Procedure Act makes an exactly similar provision. When the judge comes to Canberra to try a case, he may find that all the evidence has been taken, and it may be convenient to everybody concerned for him to exercise his jurisdiction in Melbourne or Sydney. Counsel can argue their cases as well in one place as in another. The judge may have to go to Sydney, for instance, on some other matter, and it may suit the convenience of counsel on both sides to have a case heard in one of the State capitals. The judge may change the venue after the case is half heard, and that would be a partial change of venue such as is provided for in the clause. It may be that all the facts are admitted by the parties. The suit may be filed in the Supreme Court of Canberra, but it may better meet the convenience of the parties that the arguments shall take place in a capital city where there is ready access to a law library, such as the Supreme Court libraries in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. Such a change of venue is usually made in civil actions  with the concurrence, and to meet the convenience, of both sides. No provision is made in the bill for dealing with such a case as that referred to by the honorable senator. It is provided under the criminal code of every State that where it is apprehended that a fair trial would not be obtained because the jury might be Suspected of being biased, either through hostility to or sympathy with an accused person, the venue of the hearing may be changed, I know a case in which this course was followed out of consideration for the prisoner, because the offence was of such a character as to create among the people of his neighbourhood, a psychology that made it absolutely impossible to obtain an unbiased jury. Therefore, the venue of the trial was changed to another centre, with a view to giving the man a fair trial. Nevertheless, he was convicted. It is essential, in the administration of justice, even if now and then some injustice is done, that power to change the venue of a trial shall be preserved, but I assure the honorable senator that this matter does not arise under the present measure. </para>

        <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales) &#91;4.4&#93;. - Will the Minister give an assurance that in making a change of venue, all the parties concerned will be consulted to ascertain whether the proposal meets their convenience? Is it possible that a change might be made at considerable cost and disadvantage to one of the parties? I understand that the Supreme Court will have both criminal and civil jurisdiction. Is there similar provision in relation to criminal proceedings for a change of venue on the order of the judge or anybody else? </para>

          <para>. - A change of venue in civil cases is made either by consent, or on the application of one of the parties. Having heard the parties, the judge exercises his discretion. We must leave it to the judge to decide whether, in all the circumstances, a change of venue is desirable. He is concerned only with seeing that there is fair play. Yesterday, I mentioned the necessity for a provision for a change of venue, in order that a judge may not be embarrassed through hav ing to remain in Canberra when he should be exercising jurisdiction elsewhere. This clause does not apply to criminal proceedings at all, although it is true that a judge of this court, as in the case of a High Court justice acting in Canberra, will have jurisdiction also in criminal cases.

        <para>SenatorRAE. - I recollect a case which occurred at Broken Hill in 1902, when a change of venue was sought by the Crown. The application was granted, and the trial took place at Deniliquin. Admitting, for the sake of argument.  that, on that occasion, it would have been impossible to get a fair trial at Broken Hill, because at that place there would have been partiality towards the miners, the fact remains that Deniliquin was notoriously anti-Labour. </para>

            <para>- I do not think so. It is now proposed to set up for the first time a Supreme Court for this Territory, which is practically the same as one of the States of Australia. The words &#34; any place &#34; in the Victorian or the New South Wales act refer to any place in Victoria or New South Wales as the case may be. I do not dispute that this measure can be so worded as to make it clear that the venue may be changed to any place within the Commonwealth, but unless that is made clear, the  word3  &#34;any place&#34; will be read to mean any place within the Territory for the Seat of Government. We should not take it for granted that a judge of this court will have the power to change the venue from Canberra to Melbourne or Sydney, or elsewhere. As the clause now reads, I am of the opinion that no judge of this court could perform any judicial act outside the Federal Capital Territory, any more than a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales could act outside the State. If it is intended that the judge of this court shall be empowered to change the venue to any place within the Commonwealth, this clause should be amended accordingly. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">. -Senator</inline>Rae apparently overlooks the fact that interest will be payable only on money in respect of which judgment has been given. The chances are that the suit has been pending for months - perhaps foryears - and that during the whole of that time, the successful litigant has been losing interest on his money. Moreover, it is probable that the man who has lost the suit is not what is known as a man of straw, or the suit would not have been carried to a finish against him. The charging of interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum on unsatisfied judgments means that, if a sum of &#163;20 is left unpaid for a month, the unsuccessful litigant will be charged from ls. 6d. to 2s. interest. I might be prepared to support the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bae</inline> were it not that the Commonwealth itself has an unpleasant habit of charging 10 per cent, on money which is owing and payable to it. Is it reasonable that the private creditor should be expected to take less than 5 per cent, when the Commonwealth itself imposes a fine of 10 per cent, in similar circumstances? If the honorable senator were fair, he would also stipulate that the amount of interest chargeable &#39;by the Commonwealth in such cases should not exceed 3 per cent. </para>

            <para>- I doubt whether the honorable senator would be allowed to do so, and I am quite certain that it would not be agreed to. I think, however, that, when the Commonwealth itself charges 10 per cent, on unpaid debts, it would be ridiculous for us to reduce from 5 per cent, to 3 per cent, the rate payable by private individuals. Therefore, I shall support the clause as it stands. From one point of view, it would be reasonable for the unsuccessful litigant to pay interest on the amount of the judgment from the time he first owed the money, but the law requires him to pay interest only from the time of the making of the judgment. </para>

          <para>. -  The honorable senator is assuming that when judgment is given in a civil action it must necessarily be a case in which the money belonging to one man has been wrongfully held by some other person. He should know, however, that there are many civil actions dealing with occurrences in which neither party has been standing out of his interest, because no part of his capital was involved. The Government has itself been seeking to convert loans at a lower rate of interest, and has achieved some success in that direction. Even the private banks have reduced the interest rate, and the Government savings banks have reduced the interest payable on deposits. Therefore, there is nothing improper or out of place in proposing that, in this legisla tion, we should accept things as they are, and fix lower rates of interest than might have been reasonable under the old conditions which have passed away. </para>

          <para>. -  The interest provisions in the Supreme Court acts of the States, and in the High Court Procedure Act, have always been on a higher scale than the ordinary interest rate, though why that should be I cannot say. If :i litigant successfully appeals against a judgment, then there is neither interest nor principal to pay, but if the judgment stands, it is reasonable, I think, that the man who has suffered injury should be paid interest on the amount of the judgment. The successful litigant may have been knocked down by a tram or a motor car; he may have been in hospital, and have incurred heavy medical expenses, so that, having got his judgment, he should not be kept out of his money for an undue period. The interest provision is designed to induce the unsuccessful party to satisfy the judgment as soon as possible. </para>

To that extent the sovereign rights of that State were interfered with. If the Commonwealth Government had power to pass that emergency legislation, why is it now desired to incorporate this provision in the bill? </para>

Another objection to the proposed new clause is that it seeks to impose a further charge on the Crown, and it is not competent for this committee to do that.

Special legislation has been passed by some of the States to provide for the granting of legal assistance to persons who cannot afford to pay for it. The application of this principal to the Federal Capital Territory is receiving the consideration of the Attorney-General, and if it is approved can be effected by ordinance. </para>

        <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales.) &#91;8.8&#93;. - I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister representing the Minister for Health the case of a dog known as Caesar. This dog and its owner are both Australian born. The animal was taught many wonderful tricks, and in course of time became a source of considerable revenue to its owner. Later, it was taken to Hollywood, California, where it created a sensation. After six months in the United States of America, the man was ordered to depart in accordance with the immigration laws of the country, and he returned to Sydney with his dog. The health authorities placed the animal in quarantine, and informed its owner that, so long as the dog remains in Australia, it must be kept in quarantine. A peculiar position has arisen ; the man was practically deported from America, and is not allowed to go back there, while the dog is not allowed to remain in Australia unless kept in a wire cage, where it now is. The result is that the man is deprived of the services of his dog, and the dog is robbed of its freedom. The absurdity of the regulation will be better realized by honorable senators when I remind them that, if the man were to take his dog to England, and return to Australia, the animal could he released from quarantine after 60 days if an inspection then proved it to be free from disease. </para>

        <para>SenatorRAE. - It is an Alsatian ; but that is immaterial. The point is that the dog, having come here from a country other than England, cannot remain in this country except in a cage, where it will&#39; gradually pine away. The fear that causes such a regulation to be in operation is that hydrophobia, or rabies, may be introduced by dogs coming from other countries. The authorities hold that that disease can be transmitted at any time within six months, but not after that period has expired. The dog has been in confinement in Sydney for nearly six months since its return from America. Its owner has no objection to any stated period of quarantine being enforced, even in excess of six months, in the interests of safety; but he regards as exceedingly hard a regulation which provides either that the dog shall remain in custody all its life, or that he should have to go to England with it and return to Australia to make it possible for the animal to be released from quarantine after the expiry of 60 days. </para>

          <para>SenatorRAE. - Had the mantaken the dog to England from America, it would have been admitted into the Old Country, in which case he would probably have had the use of the dog 60 days after his return to Australia. If it is considered safe to introduce a dog from England after only 60 days in quarantine, surely it shouldbe safe to release it after six months from the time of its arrival here from another country! Should a careful examination by a veterinary surgeon prove the dog to be free from disease, there seems to me to be no reason why the regulations should not be relaxed. The dog&#39;s owner is losing considerable revenue because of his inability to exhibit the animal, which at times has earned for him as much as &#163;100 a week. I am informed that some of the tricks which this dog performs are almost incredible. The man has not been selfish, for on many occasions he has given performances for the benefit of charity. I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to make inquiries with a view to seeing whether it is not possible to relax the regulations to enable the dog to be restored&#39; to its owner. </para>

It seemed to me rather peculiar that the quarantine laws should differentiate between one part of the northern hemisphere and another, and I therefore sent the letter to the Minister for Health. All honorable senators realize the necessity for a strict supervision of the introduction of (logs from other countries, because,so far, Australia is one of the few countries free from rabies.
