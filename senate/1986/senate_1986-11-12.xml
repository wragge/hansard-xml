<TITLE>Identification Card Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. This petition by the undersigned people strongly opposes the introduction of the numbered I.D. card system.</PARA>
<PARA> This system is totally unnecessary as adequate means of identification already exist and it is also a threat to our civil liberties and the privacy of everybody.</PARA>
<PARA> In the present bad economic climate there is no justification for wasting millions of dollars to force people to get unnecessary extra identification. We therefore ask that the Senate reject any proposal for a National Identification Numbering System.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Loan Interest Rates</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate. The humble petition of we the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The high interest rates on home loans of 13.5 per cent has and is placing the recipients in a financially disastrous position, as thousands have lost their homes and thousands more will do so if these appalling conditions continue for the young and established home purchasers.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your House urge politicians that therefore no government or opposition in a power position should continue to tolerate this cruel, vicious procedure that shatters the very structure of family life.</PARA>
<PARA> We need a five year period to reduce this absurdity by tackling it at its source. Firstly, interest repayments on home loans to be reduced by 2 per cent annually for the next five years or until it is down to 6 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> This would, or should diminish union demands, and cause no hazard for investors, who could reinvest in Government projects, or other worthwhile ventures and also ease the burden on Social Securities.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely:</PARA>

<TITLE>Chernobyl Nuclear Accident</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on 26 April 1986, the Soviet Union has not yet adequately explained to its citizens of those of the Soviet-occupied Baltic States, Ukraine and other areas affected by the radiation fall-out the potential short-term and long-term health hazards and the available modes of prevention or reduction of radiation poisoning. Neither have the appropriate medicines for substitution therapies to minimise bodily accumulation of radioactive elements been adequately provided.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That the Soviet Union operates many nuclear power stations without the elementary structural safeguards against radioactive spillage regarded as mandatory in the West. Of particular concern is the safety of the largest Soviet nuclear power station at Ignalina in Soviet occupied Lithuania, of similar design to Chernobyl, which already has a record of operational problems. Radioactive spillage at Ignalina would quickly contaminate the whole of Latvia, Lithuania as well as vast areas of Europe.</PARA>
<PARA> We request that the Australian Government will:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Through the World Health Organization, provide medical aid and broadcast medical information to the victims of radiation exposure following the Chernobyl disaster.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Through the United Nations Organisation request the Soviet Union</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to close down all nuclear power stations similar to Chernobyl till protective structures are built.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. its severe and damaging effect on business confidence, investment and incentive, especially in the rural, mining and small business sectors.</PARA>

<PARA> 3. its extremely negative impact on the competitiveness of export industries at a time when the nation desperately needs to improve its trading performance.</PARA>

<TITLE>Fringe Benefits Tax Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the fringe benefits tax will place enormous cost increases on employers throughout Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) in so doing, the fringe benefits tax will raise the cost of employing labour particularly in remote locations and it will inevitably worsen the already high level of unemployment in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) much of the cost of the tax will be carried by employees as employers reduce benefits; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the cost of the tax will harm small business particularly as these businesses will be unable to pass on the cost of the tax and as a result many may be forced to close.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I table the explanatory memorandum, and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes revised assistance arrangements for fertilisers as announced by the Treasurer in his 1986-87 budget speech and amalgamates the Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy and the Phosphate Fertilisers Subsidy into one Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new arrangements subsidy will no longer be payable on imported phosphatic and nitrogenous fertilisers. The expenditure saved from this decision has however been re-allocated to increase the subsidy rates on the consumption of locally produced phosphatic fertilisers particularly higher analysis phosphate products in recognition of modern trends in fertiliser usage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned that subsidy benefits will continue to be passed on in full to the consumers. Accordingly this Bill contains strengthened provisions designed to effect this end. </PARA>
<PARA> The objective of the Government's policy changes is to bring some rationale to the subsidisation of fertiliser consumption. It is most unusual to subsidise imports at any time and certainly inappropriate in the light of Australia's current trading position. The changes are therefore designed to provide benefits to the balance of payments, to bring some benefits to manufacturers in the form of increased price competitiveness and at the same time avoid disadvantaging the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to withdraw subsidies from imported fertilisers followed long and careful consideration of all the issues involved and consultation with all interested parties. The Industries Assistance Commission studied the industry and reported in October 1985. This was followed by a study by an interdepartmental working group of officers from the Departments of Industry, Technology and Commerce, Primary Industry and the Prime Minister and Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps more than with any other issue, the Government has faced a difficult task in trying to reconcile the interests of the producers and users of this important commodity. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsidies on fertilisers represent an important element of the Government's support for the rural sector. The changes contained in this Bill reflect the Government's strong commitment to that sector and our desire to ensure that the support should be directed in the most efficient manner possible. </PARA>
<PARA> In the economic and rural policy statement delivered earlier this year we said: `The overall cost of fertilisers will not rise as a result of any decisions that may flow from the Government's consideration of the interdepartmental review or Professor Gruen's review of the Customs (Anti-dumping) Legislation'. We also said that the amount of funding available for fertiliser subsidies would be maintained over the life of the scheme and the appropriations for 1986-87 reflect that commitment. Unlike funding for production bounties which was reduced by 20 per cent in the Budget, funding for fertiliser consumption subsidies has been maintained at $55m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, the amount previously used to subsidise imports has been reallocated to the consumption of domestically produced phosphatic fertilisers. In doing this the Government has taken particular note of the growing preference of farmers for higher analysis fertilisers by weighting the increase in the subsidies towards these products. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 12 of the Bill sets out the increased subsidy on Australian phosphate fertilisers during the 3-year period of the new scheme. These rates are explained in detail in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsidy payable on nitrogenous fertiliser remains at $20 per tonne of nitrogen content. We have not increased the subsidy on nitrogen because the amount per unit would be negligible, however nitrogen users who use fertiliser mixtures will benefit from the increased subsidy on phosphorus. As a result of these changes, the majority of farmers now pay less for their fertilisers. All manufacturers reduced their prices following the Budget, in some cases after also cancelling previously announced price rises. The price of single superphosphate has generally fallen by $1.30 per tonne and the reductions for the more concentrated phosphatic fertilisers have ranged up to $11 per tonne. This is because subsidy rates have increased by between 10 and 35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry has responded by increasing its output of these concentrated, high analysis fertilisers, to meet the demands of farmers seeking to take advantage of the increased subsidies. The Government has also taken separate action to remove a potential impediment to this change in the manufacturers' product mix. The potentially prohibitive import duty on phosphoric acid used in fertiliser production was removed on 1 November 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been claims that there is insufficient manufacturing capacity in Australia to meet all the requirements of farmers for fertiliser. Both the IAC in its report on the industry and the Department of Primary Industry in its booklet `Chemical Fertilisers in Australia' have concluded that the domestic manufacturers do have the necessary phosphatic production capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Some farmers, however, will no doubt continue to rely on imported products. I understand that most importers have not raised their prices since the Budget, choosing instead to absorb the effects of the removal of subsidy. The main importers are backed by large corporations, in some cases American fertiliser manufacturers, and are not the small companies which some commentators would have us believe. </PARA>
<PARA> The imported price is of course a world price and still a dumped one at that. The Government will continue however to provide grants which offset the effects of dumping duties on fertilisers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes provisions in parts 3, 4 and 5, updating the old legislation to improve administrative effectiveness, in line with similar provisions recently introduced in other subsidy and bounty legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible that competition from imports will decline during the next 3 years, or that suspicions might arise among the rural sector that manufacturers are not passing on the full benefit of the subsidies. This Bill strengthens the statutory requirements to ensure that manufacturers do continue to pass on the subsidy. Provisions at clauses 10 and 22 permit the Comptroller-General of Customs to direct that subsidy not be paid to a producer if the producer is not passing on the full benefit of the subsidy and require an appropriate undertaking to be given prior to registration for subsidy purposes. The previous law only contained a provision similar to clause 10. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this, the Government is at present considering revised guidelines against which proposed price increases are assessed, to take account of the new subsidy arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe the new arrangements proposed by this legislation to be in the long term interests of Australian farmers. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA> The subsidies proposed by this Bill are expected to cost $55m per annum for the next 3 years. The changes proposed by this Bill will not alter expenditure on current fertiliser subsidies as the subsidies previously paid on imports have been reallocated across locally produced phosphatic fertilisers in the form of higher subsidy rates on those products. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>I table the explanatory memorandum, and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is part of a new ship repair assistance package announced by the Government on 10 October 1986, following consideration of a report on the Australian ship repair industry by a quadripartite working group established in June 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> The major elements of the package are a bounty payable to registered ship repairers and the clarification of the Government's powers of enforcement in its ship safety inspections to give effect to internationally accepted health and safety standards. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes the introduction of the cash limited bounty scheme to apply to eligible repairs undertaken by registered ship repairers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Its companion which I will introduce in a few moments proposes amendments to the Navigation Act 1912 to effect that part of the arrangements relating to safety inspection. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian ship repairers face a severe cost disability in relation to overseas repairers. There is significant excess repair capacity in Australia mainly resulting from the failure of the industry to invest in contemporary technologies and to adopt efficient work practices. </PARA>
<PARA> Ship repair and maritime unions concerned about the industry's continuing decline and the use of sub-standard shipping in Australian waters have been conducting a campaign to gain additional ship repair work. This has involved detaining vessels and insisting on repairs which in the view of the unions will remove the sub-standard conditions on board. </PARA>
<PARA> These practices have damaged the reputation of the ship repair industry and our reputation as a reliable trading partner. </PARA>
<PARA> The working group I referred to earlier comprising representatives of trade unions, Government, shipowners and ship repairers made several recommendations aimed at increasing the throughput and efficiency of Australian ship repairers. It agreed that any plan of action for the industry must be accompanied by widespread improvement in terms of better work practices and lower costs. It therefore proposed a package approach under which Commonwealth assistance would be conditional upon commitments from the parties involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I am happy to say that since the working party reported a series of discussions have been held with the industry and the unions and all parties have agreed to accept the proposed package. This agreement represents a significant contribution by both the industry and trade unions; indeed the ship repair and maritime unions have agreed to end their detention campaign as a pre-condition to the implementation of the package. I should mention however that the Bill contains a provision at clause 11 to enable the Minister to cease all bounty payments under the Act should the union campaign be re-activated. This may apply regardless of whether the campaign is wide spread or directed at one particular vessel. Decisions of the Minister in this regard will not be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Government believes that review by that body is inappropriate in this case as any decision will involve high level industrial relations policy issues. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of its contribution the Government will:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Extend the Department of Transport's official ship safety inspection system to give effect to internationally accepted health and safety standards based on the international Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention 147. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Allow those parts which enter Australia duty free when for use in the construction or modification or ships to also enter duty free when for use in ship repair; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Introduce registration criteria to be met by ship repairers before being eligible for bounty. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed bounty in this Bill will be limited to $6m over the next 3 years with bounty payable at a rate of 30 per cent of contract price where eligible repairs cost between $100,000 and $400,000 and 20 per cent for that part exceeding $400,000. Bounty will only be paid to registered repairers for certain repairs to international trading vessels of at least 6,000 dead weight tonnes, whether Australian or foreign owned. </PARA>
<PARA> Eligible repairs fall to the following categories-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Dry docking (including structural repairs and painting)</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Engine repairs, modifications or conversions</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Ship systems, which include repairs, modifications or conversions to:</PARA>
<PARA> Electronic systems;</PARA>
<PARA> Electrical systems;</PARA>
<PARA> Communications systems; and</PARA>
<PARA> Hydraulic systems; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Accommodation refurbishment or upgrading. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the eligibility for bounty provisions in clause 10, Australian repairers will be required to enter into repair or service contracts with the owners of eligible ships, and because of the bounty limit of $6m in clause 12 they will be required to reserve amounts available for the payment of bounty in respect of the repairs carried out pursuant to those contracts. This should encourage more planned repairs to be performed in Australia, and at the same time, ensure that amounts will be available for the payment of bounty to those repairers who undertake eligible repair work. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 12 of the Bill contains provisions similar to those currently operating in relation to shipbuilding concerning the reservation of bounty. As in the shipbuilding scheme bounty will be allocated to repairers on a `first come first served' basis. Those not on the reservation list will be unlikely to receive bounty. Preference for reservation will be given to persons who are to repair pursuant to written contracts followed by those who will repair on the basis of other than written contracts. Provision has also been made for the regulations to prescribe maximum amounts that may be reserved in relation to repair or service contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned that part of the Government's ship repair package is the introduction of registration criteria for the purposes of bounty eligibility. To be eligible to receive bounty, repairers will have to meet strict registration criteria including codes of business and industrial relations practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of these criteria, which will be set out in the regulations, will require detailed analysis of the industry and close consultation with unions, employers and some State governments. I am also expanding the shipbuilding consultative group to include a representative of the repair industry to assist in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that introduction of this assistance package will facilitate industry rationalisation and encourage the development of markets which do not currently exist for Australian repairers. It will restore predictability to the industry and improve efficiency within the ship repair industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, parts 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill include a number of standard administrative provisions, which are modelled on similar provisions in other recent bounty and subsidy legislation. These provisions are designed to not only assist the expeditious processing of claims, but also to ensure that proper verification and investigation of claims can proceed where necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of the bounty assistance to the ship repair industry is limited by clause 12 to $6m over the next 3 years. The relevant appropriation for the financial year 1986-87 is $1.5m. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> In presenting the Bounty (Ship Repair) Bill 1986, I foreshadowed the contribution to the ship repair assistance package to be made by the Transport portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> The Navigation Amendment Bill 1986 addresses the issue of substandard ships plying Australian waters, giving the Minister the power to detain a ship on which conditions are such as to present, in the words of the International Labour Organisation's Convention No. 147, `a clear hazard to safety or health.'</PARA>
<PARA> The amendment is necessary because the existing powers of detention provided by the Navigation Act 1912 apply only to ships that are unseaworthy, as defined. The term `unseaworthy' has a traditional and internationally understood meaning which does not extend to hazards of the kind that this Bill is concerned with. </PARA>
<PARA> Following passage of the Bill, the various criteria warranting detention of a ship as substandard will be finalised in tripartite consultation with industry, based on the safety and health standards established by the International Labour Organisation and included in Convention No. 147.

<PARA> That the Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>It is with great satisfaction that I introduce the Disability Services Bill. The Bill represents the culmination of sustained effort by a broad cross-section of those many people, both within and outside government, concerned for the future of people with disabilities and families which contain a person with a disability. Honourable senators will recall that during the International Year of Disabled Persons 1981 there was a tremendous surge of interest in the potential, needs, and problems of people with disabilities and the general dissatisfaction with traditional services provided in such areas as accommodation, employment and living skills. On attaining office, this Government decided that there was a need for fundamental change in the way the community provides for the needs of people with disabilities and that a truly comprehensive review of all Commonwealth policies and programs was required. Accordingly, in late 1983, the Government instigated the Handicapped Programs Review to examine all Commonwealth programs and services directed at assisting people with disabilities. This Review was the first of its kind in Australia. It sought submissions from interested groups and individuals and held extensive community consultation, especially with people with disabilities, their families, and service providers. The Bill before us is based on the findings of that Review, the report of which, entitled `New Directions', I tabled in Parliament on 30 May 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The report found broad community support for the Commonwealth's policies of meeting needs through mainstream community programs as far as possible, and the ensuring that the least restrictive alternative principle is followed where specific services are required for people with disabilities. Where specific services were required, the Review emphasised that the fundamental criterion in service provision should be the actual outcomes achieved for people with disabilities who are the users of those services-that is, the consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The report concluded that substantial improvements were required in the accountability of subsidised organisations for service content and quality, and that major changes were needed in the programs themselves to reflect this consumer outcomes focus. A restructuring of services, funding and other resources was also required. </PARA>
<PARA> The Review believed that these changes could be effected only through legislative change, particularly the replacement of the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 and the introduction of new legislation based on the principle that positive consumer outcomes should be the rationale for program development, delivery and review. On 12 June this year I made a statement in the Senate on the Government's intention to introduce new legislation in these parliamentary sittings, and in that statement I outlined the purposes and scope of the proposed Bill. This Bill honours that commitment. The Disability Advisory Council of Australia and the Office of Disability have played a major role in the development of the legislation. The establishment of the Office of Disability was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in December 1984, with a role which includes carrying forward the thrust of the `New Directions' report. </PARA>
<PARA>Purposes and Objects</PARA>
<PARA> The new legislation, intended to take effect as from 1 July 1987, will serve a number of purposes:</PARA>
<PARA> First, the Bill provides the future legislative basis for the provision of financial assistance to organisations conducting services for people with disabilities to replace the present source of assistance, namely, the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974, which, apart from certain provisions, will be repealed; the Bill also provides a basis, for the first time under this program, of assisting States for similar purposes;</PARA>
<PARA> Second, it provides a specific legislative base for two related sub-programs-the program upgrading scheme and assistance for people with print disabilities-by incorporating them into the new legislation;</PARA>
<PARA> Third, it provides for the funding and other mechanisms by means of which existing subsidised services under certain conditions may continue to receive financial support while upgrading to meet the more stringent requirements of the new legislation;</PARA>
<PARA> Fourth, it introduces greater protection for the interests of both the Commonwealth and people with disabilities who are the users of subsidised services; this is achieved by a variety of provisions and features of the Bill, including a requirement that all services be formally reviewed at intervals of no more than 5 years;</PARA>
<PARA> Fifth, it provides for a range of activities, such as program related research and development, intended to ensure that services funded under the program are designed to suit the changing needs of people with disabilities;</PARA>
<PARA> Sixth, the Bill provides a new legislative base for the provision of rehabilitation services by the Commonwealth currently provided for under Part VIII of the Social Security Act 1947. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill contains an explicit statement of its objects which will guide the interpretation and administration of the new Act. These are couched in terms of the benefits and objectives desired to be achieved for individual people with disabilities and reflect the philosophical position of the Government outlined in the draft principles and objectives attached to my statement of 12 June 1986 and refined in the consultation process since then in relation to people who experience double disadvantage because of sex, ethnic origin or Aboriginality. It is my intention that these principles and objectives be formalised and be gazetted and so brought within the ambit of the legislation. These principles and objectives will form the basic yardstick for the development of the program. I seek leave to have them incorporated in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES</PARA>
<PARA>Principles</PARA>
<PARA> 1. People with disabilities are individuals who have the inherent right to respect for their human worth and dignity. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. People with disabilities, whatever the origin, nature, type and degree of disability, have the same fundamental rights as all members of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Every person with a disability has the same rights as other members of Australian society to realise his or her individual capacity for physical, social, emotional and intellectual development. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. People with disabilities have the same right as other members of Australian society to services which will support their attaining an acceptable quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. People with disabilities have the same right as other members of Australian society to participate in the decisions which affect their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. People with disabilities have the same right as other members of Australian society to the least restrictive alternative in the services they receive. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. People with disabilities have the same right of pursuit of any grievance as have other members of Australian society in relation to the services which they receive. </PARA>
<PARA>These Principles may be translated into objectives for service delivery as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Objectives</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That the focus of service delivery to people with disabilities should be the achievement of positive outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. That services for people with disabilities should ensure that the conditions of the every-day life of people with disabilities are the same as, or as close as possible to, norms and patterns which are valued in the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. That services for people with disabilities should be provided as part of local co-ordinated service systems and integrated with generic services wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. That people with disabilities should receive services which are tailored to their individual needs and goals. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. That programs and services should reflect the needs of people with disabilities who experience double disadvantage as a result of sex, ethnic origin, and Aboriginality. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. That programs and services should promote a competent and positive image of people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. That programs and services should promote the participation of people with disabilities in the life of the local community through maximum physical and social integration. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. That no single organisation providing services should exercise control over all or most aspects of the life of an individual with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. That services providing assistance to people with disabilities, be they specific or generic, should be accountable to consumers and their representatives, funding bodies and the public at large. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. That programs and services should provide opportunities for people with disabilities to reach goals and enjoy lifestyles which are valued by the community at large and are appropriate to their chronological age. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. That people with disabilities should have access to advocacy support where necessary to ensure adequate participation in decision-making about the services they receive. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. That services should provide appropriate avenues for people with disabilities to air and resolve any grievances about the services they receive. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. That people with disabilities should be provided with avenues for participating in the planning and operation of individual services and opportunities for consultation relating to major policy development and program changes. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. That services for people with disabilities should respect an individual's rights of privacy and confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA> In the above references, individuals with disabilities should be read to include advocates and families of children with disabilities where appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The principles and objectives to which I have referred will become integral to the administration of the programs under this new legislation. I also emphasise here that these principles and objectives reflect the Government's belief about how all services for people with disabilities ought to be developed and delivered-not simply those services to be supported under the present Bill. Accordingly, we will be encouraging their use across all relevant programs and services for people with disabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Other Key Features</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill brings together two related programs within my portfolio. Part II of the Bill deals with the provision of financial assistance to organisations, and States, conducting services for people with disabilities, and is directed at implementing the thrust of the New Directions report as far as this program is concerned and overcoming the deficiencies inherent in the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974. Part III deals with the operations of the rehabilitation services program. The new provisions associated with Part II have the following important features. </PARA>
<PARA>Target Group</PARA>
<PARA> First, there is a clearly and consistently defined target group which will remove doubt about the intended users of services receiving Commonwealth support under this program. To qualify for assistance under the new provisions, services must be predominantly for persons who have a disability deriving from intellectual, sensory or physical impairment, or a combination of these; whose disability is permanent or likely to be permanent; and whose disability results in a substantially reduced capacity for communication, learning or mobility and a need for on-going support under Part II. There may be some funded organisations which presently provide services to people who do not predominantly fit the target group. These services will not come under the new legislation but separate carry-on funding will be provided for them until alternative arrangements can be made. It is recognised that some agencies have included in their services small numbers of people who do not come within the target group definition; these services will nevertheless be able to come within the new legislation and this will be reflected in the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>Eligible Services</PARA>
<PARA> To ensure the legislation remains flexible and responsive to the needs of people with disabilities over time, the Bill adopts an innovative approach to endorsing the various service types which may in future attract financial assistance. Under the Bill, the Minister may approve specified kinds of services from a comprehensive list, but the Minister may also approve other classes of services which would further the objective of the new Act-thus overcoming one of the major deficiencies in the present Act. To provide for parliamentary scrutiny, these approvals will be gazetted and subject to disallowance provisions in the same way as regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Organisations and Bodies Eligible for Financial Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that both States and eligible organisations may qualify for financial assistance for the provision of eligible services. The inclusion of States is a major change; it reflects the fact that most States are already involved to varying degrees in service provision, and the many potential opportunities for co-operative efforts in this field. The new legislation will permit the Commonwealth to provide funds to the States for services provided by them covered under the legislation. The intention is that such funding be provided on similar conditions to those relating to eligible organisations. The legislation will also permit the joint Commonwealth-State funding of services and projects considered as being of joint interest. This will overcome a major restriction of the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 and will enable a more co-ordinated effort on behalf of people with disabilities who are part of the target group-for example in relation to the provision of housing or meeting the needs of people with more severe disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The types of organisations which will be eligible for financial assistance for the provision of services under the new Act will be broadly similar to those eligible under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974, although some changes have been included to meet current circumstances. One significant change is that self-help groups will be eligible provided they intend to seek incorporation. Generally, formal incorporation will be expected of all ordinary service providers. The not-for-profit motive remains as a general requirement, local governing bodies continue to be eligible, and in future recognised tertiary institutions will also be eligible. There will be capacity for the Minister to approve other not-for-profit bodies if that furthers the purposes of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Positive Client Outcome Focus</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has been drafted to ensure that the focus of funding and administration remains on the achievement of desirable outcomes for people with disabilities. This is reflected in particular in the inclusion of a statement of objects of the Bill; the provision for the gazettal of principles and objectives to be furthered, and guidelines to be complied with, in the administration of the legislation; the new definitions of the basic service types; the new mechanisms for approving eligible classes of services generally; the comprehensive provisions relating to the actual making of grants and the terms and conditions which may attach to the financial assistance, including specific reference to agreed client outcomes; and the statutory requirement that all funded services be subject to a formal review against these agreed client outcome objectives. These various provisions meet the central concerns of the handicapped program review in relation to the disability services program. </PARA>
<PARA>Mode of Administration</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has been drafted for flexibility and economy of administration. The basic approach taken in relation to Part II is that the Act should set the basic parameters, leaving the more important administrative detail to be dealt with by means of gazetted instruments and regulations which would be subject to the scrutiny of Parliament. Regulations will cover such matters as the detailed funding formulae to apply to the various service types, including transitional funding provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Introduction Strategy and Transitional Provisions for Existing Services</PARA>
<PARA> The approach adopted by the Government to introducing fundamental changes in the program addressed by Part II is to have the Bill provide for both the new program structure and the means by which existing subsidised services can, under acceptable conditions, be upgraded and progressively transferred into the new structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Any services for which initial funding is sought after the intended date of commencement of this Part of the Act, that is, 1 July 1987, naturally will be expected to meet the more rigorous standards of the new program immediately. Existing services will need both time and possibly additional support to enable them to make the transition and this is recognised and made possible within the strategy of the Bill. The structure of Part II provides for these two levels of operation and the transition process-with Divisions 1 and 2 essentially providing the framework for the new program and Division 3 that for the upgrading and transition of existing services into the new program over a maximum five-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> As mentioned in my June 1986 statement, a major consultancy has been commenced so that detailed funding formulae for the new program can be developed. Because of the nature of the task and the need for the Government to consider any new proposals, it is not expected that new formulae can be implemented before 1 July 1988. In the interim, the Government intends that, as with services within the transitional provisions, funding be the same as currently provided under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974, plus increased base staff subsidy which will also be provided to existing services under certain conditions. As with transitional funding for existing services, this will be dealt with by regulation. The increase in base staff subsidy was referred to in my statement on disability services made in the context of the August 1986 Budget tabled in the Senate on 17 September 1986. This initiative will cost $21m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> The intention of the Government is that the new funding formulae to support the new program on an ongoing basis will be responsive to differing client needs and the needs of the different service types. I believe such an approach has the in-principle support of service providers, most of whom recognise, as the Government does, the irrationality, inequities and disincentives associated with the traditional funding approach of the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974-which did not recognise the different resourcing needs associated with different levels of disability and service types. This has tended to discourage the provision of adequate services to people with disabilities requiring higher levels of support and the introduction of innovative services. The Government is looking to the new formulae being developed to help correct this bias and other deficiencies of the current funding provisions identified in the handicapped programs review, including the potential for providing incentives for performance in the achievement of positive client outcomes. The upgrading and transfer of existing services progressively into the new program will be a significant task and a strategy has been developed to accomplish this which in recent weeks has been the focus of extensive consultations with consumer groups, service providers and representatives of State governments across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, the transition strategy for existing services involves the following components:</PARA>
<PARA> Early in 1987, existing services will be invited to indicate that, subject to meeting the target group criteria, they are willing to negotiate new service contracts. These contracts will include commitment to the principles and objectives and to specific outcomes that will be achieved with additional assistance to be provided where the basic staff subsidy of 50 per cent is increased to 65 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> From the commencement of the Act on 1 July 1987, those services which enter into the new service contracts will continue to receive ongoing support at current Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 levels plus the additional staff subsidy component. These services will be referred to in the Act as prescribed services. </PARA>
<PARA> With the introduction of the new funding formulae, these prescribed services will be progressively brought within the new program structure. This will be subject to their meeting certain conditions that demonstrate a capacity to comply with the principles and objectives, to meet the more stringent requirements, and to achieve acceptable positive client outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Prescribed services which have been brought under these transitional provisions but fail to meet their upgrading and restructuring obligations will not be funded beyond 30 June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> Where existing services are ineligible under the Act, by virtue of their client composition, the intention is that carry-on funding outside the Act will be provided under ministerial discretion pending the making of longer term arrangements for those services. This will be to ensure that the welfare of people with disabilities who use those services is not adversely affected. </PARA>
<PARA> Current services which are unwilling to commit themselves to meeting the new requirements will be funded outside the Act for a limited time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Provision of Rehabilitation Services by the Commonwealth</PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the Bill incorporates a new legislative base for the provision of rehabilitation services by the Commonwealth, currently provided through Part VIII of the Social Security Act 1947. This constitutes Part III of the Bill. These services are for people of working age requiring rehabilitation programs for a limited time to enhance their prospects of entering, re-entering or remaining in employment or living independently. </PARA>
<PARA> The main provisions of the current legislation are retained in Part III with some amendments having been introduced to enable a greater range of services to be provided, and to streamline the administration of the program. In particular, the Bill widens the scope of what may be provided to an eligible person, from `treatment and training' as it is currently described in the legislation to `a rehabilitation program'. This is consistent with the changes which are taking place in the delivery of rehabilitation services from a predominantly institutional and medically oriented base to a regional base which concentrates on social and vocational programs. The new definition will still allow my Department to arrange for the provision of treatment services where they are necessary, but it will also enable the provision of a wide range of other services which will assist people with disabilities in the target group for this program to reach their social or vocational goal. This, of course, includes an increased capacity to live independently. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also enable support to be provided, by way of work place modifications or special equipment, to assist people with disabilities to retain their employment; this assistance is not possible under the existing legislation which was confined essentially to those people with disabilities who were unemployed. At the same time, the Bill will enable the Secretary to charge for all or part of the cost of a rehabilitation program where a client has the financial ability to meet that cost. Rehabilitation services will continue to be provided free to those relying on a pension or benefit for their income. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of this legislation from the Social Security Act 1947 means that the Social Security Appeals Tribunal is no longer appropriate as an avenue of appeal to clients undertaking rehabilitation programs through my Department. Nevertheless, the Bill makes specific provision for clients of the rehabilitation services program to apply to the Secretary of the Department and subsequently to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of decisions with which they are dissatisfied. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also incorporates strict penalties for those disclosing information on clients and I believe that these penalties and the appeal rights which I have just mentioned are a further indication that this Bill recognises the rights of people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Program of Aids for People with Disabilities</PARA>
<PARA> In my June 1986 statement, I indicated that it was intended that the Bill would incorporate the Commonwealth's program of aids for disabled people-PADP. This program provides funds for the provision, through State and Territory health services infrastructures, of a range of aids to assist people with disabilities live in the community. Since my June parliamentary statement, and as referred to in my subsequent public statement on disability services issued at the time of the August 1986 Budget, the Commonwealth has been negotiating with the States on the implementation of new arrangements for Commonwealth aids assistance. As these negotiations are still proceeding, the Government has decided not to disturb the present legislative provisions for this program at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that the Bill will be proclaimed to commence on 1 July 1987. It is estimated that expenditure on services for people with disabilities under this Bill will be of the order of $140m in 1987-88 and $152m in 1988-89. It is estimated that expenditure on the provision of rehabilitation services by the Commonwealth under this Bill will be $3.9m in 1987-88 and $6m in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA> The Disability Services Bill provides a new deal for people with disabilities-one in which there is a strong legislatively sanctioned framework for the maximisation of their potential through the provision of appropriate, responsive and well-managed services within a flexible program, with the proper recognition of their rights and dignity and opportunity for the fullest possible participation in the community. With this Bill and the related measures announced in the Budget, the Government believes it has honoured its commitment to reform one of its major program areas in accordance with the handicapped programs review. The Government has set the stage, and it will be up to all the players-Parliament, government, departments, service providers, people with disabilities, parents of people with disabilities and the community at large-to ensure that the spirit of the legislation is kept to the fore and acted upon. We have sought to establish a dynamic, responsive process which the community at large and all levels of government can use to meet the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities in positive and creative ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I take this opportunity to thank those many groups and individuals, including a great many people with disabilities, the Disability Advisory Council of Australia, the Office of Dis- ability, and officers of my Department, who have contributed in various ways to the shaping of the Bill. It truly reflects the spirit of consensus which the Government has sought to bring to the issues of importance to all Australians. I commend the Bill to the Senate, and I table the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I seek leave to have the second reading speech for the Disability Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1986 incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill serves a number of purposes relating to the introduction of the Disability Services Bill 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> The main measures contained in the Bill are amendments to the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 and Part VIII of the Social Security Act 1947 consequential to the introduction of the Disability Services Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will provide for the repeal of Parts II to VI of the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 from the date of commencement of Part II of the Disability Services Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The repeal of Parts II to VI will prevent the making of any further grants under this Act in relation to capital projects, maintenance or rent of premises, acquisition of equipment, and the provision of recurrent funding in relation to staff. The financial assistance currently provided under these Parts will be provided under the new Disability Services Act upon its commencement. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will retain the current funding arrangements under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 in relation to the following three payments-</PARA>
<PARA> the handicapped children's benefit will continue to be paid to eligible organisations that provide approved residential accommodation for handicapped children;</PARA>
<PARA> training fees (a one-off payment of $500 for each sheltered employee who successfully moves to open employment) will continue to be paid to eligible organisations that provide sheltered employment; and</PARA>
<PARA> the open employment incentive bonus (a one-off payment of $500) will continue to be paid to a sheltered employee who successfully moves to open employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding arrangements for these payments will be retained so as not to disadvantage eligible organisations providing existing prescribed services and persons with disabilities who benefit from these services. However, these funding arrangements will be retained only until 30 June 1992, after which no further payments may be made under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974. This is also the date after which no further funding will be payable to prescribed services existing at the date of commencement of the Disability Services Act which have not made the transition to become eligible services under that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will repeal those provisions of Part VIII of the Social Security Act 1947 made redundant by Part III of the Disability Services Act, from the date of commencement of that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Rehabilitation allowance, paid in relation to certain persons undertaking a rehabilitation program under Part III of the Disability Services Act, will continue to be paid under Part VIII of the Social Security Act 1947. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will also make transitional arrangements in relation to certain matters arising under provisions of the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 and the Social Security Act 1947 repealed by this Bill as a consequence of the Disability Services Bill 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will also amend the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971, the Defence (Re-establishment) Act 1965, the Re-establishment and Employment Act 1945, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, and the Veterans' Entitlements (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1986 to make amendments consequential to the introduction of the Disability Services Bill 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is expected to involve no significant expenditure or savings. The net financial impact is expected to be neutral. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and table the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend four Commonwealth Acts to enable Australia to implement a number of anti-pollution initiatives and to improve aspects of the existing legislation. The Bill represents a further major step in marine pollution prevention and control in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators will be aware that the Government is committed to ensuring Australia's acceptance of conventions which have benefits for Australia and which will enhance our reputation internationally. Accordingly, our national transport policy supports the promotion, conclusion, ratification and application of transport conventions under the auspices of the United Nations and its specialised agencies, in particular the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). </PARA>
<PARA> Since coming into office, the Hawke Government has demonstrated an active participation in the work of IMO. This is illustrated by Australia becoming a party to the following conventions:</PARA>
<PARA> International convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 and its 1978 protocol (entered into force for Australia in 1983);</PARA>
<PARA> the 1983 amendment to the International Convention on Load Lines 1966 (1984);</PARA>
<PARA> the International Convention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969 and the Protocol relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Pollution by Substances Other Than Oil, 1973 (1983);</PARA>
<PARA> the International Convention of Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969 and its 1976 protocol (1983);</PARA>
<PARA> the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978 (1983);</PARA>
<PARA> the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, 1979 (1983); and</PARA>
<PARA> the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972 (1985). </PARA>
<PARA> As an island nation, Australia, with its extensive coastline and spread of territorial waters, possesses national assets of immense economic and recreational worth. Accordingly it is of fundamental importance that we face up to our responsibility and ensure that we continue to provide a high level of protection for our marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this Bill has the capacity to further improve marine environment protection by prohibiting the discharge of harmful substances into the sea. It is incremental to and consistent with the approach taken by this Government towards the marine environment on previous occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill currently before the Senate contains amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 and the Navigation Act 1912, which will enable Australia to implement annexes III, IV and V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (MARPOL). </PARA>
<PARA> This will place Australia in a position to exercise control over the discharge of ship-sourced pollutants of all types. </PARA>
<PARA> MARPOL, as the 1973 Convention and its 1978 protocol are commonly known, is a significant departure from previous pollution conventions, as the one treaty addresses ship sourced pollution in all the various forms. Australia signed the convention, subject to ratification, in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> Contracting states to MARPOL are obliged to apply Annexes I and II, which deal with oil and noxious liquid substances respectively. Annexes III, IV and V are optional and respectively deal with pollution by harmful substances carried in packaged form, sewage and garbage. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation to bring annexes I and II of the Convention into force was passed by Federal Parliament in the autumn sittings of 1983, with bipartisan support.</PARA>
<PARA> Amending legislation extending the operation of the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act to include all ships in the Australian territorial sea and coastal waters also received bipartisan support and was passed in the autumn sittings 1986. The current Bill will enable Australia to fully implement the remaining requirements of this Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out that Marpol annexes III, IV and V will be implemented by way of complementary Commonwealth-State-Territory legislation in accordance with an agreement reached by Ministers of the Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC) and endorsed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The annexes, therefore, will be accepted by Australia when all the necessary legislation is enacted by all governments and they will enter into force for Australia when the annexes enter into force internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> Annexes III, IV and V of Marpol will each enter into force internationally 12 months after the date on which a minimum number of 15 states, with not less than 50 per cent of the gross tonnage of the world's merchant shipping, become party to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Although these conditions have not yet been fulfilled, progress is being made and annexes III and V are expected to enter into force within the next 18 months. There is not as much international support for annex IV which could result in its entry into force being less certain. </PARA>
<PARA> I will briefly summarise the contents of annexes III, IV and V. </PARA>
<PARA> Annex III contains regulations for the prevention of pollution by harmful substances carried by sea in packaged forms, or in freight containers, portable tanks or road and rail tank wagons. The annex contains specific requirements relating to the packaging and carriage of such substances. Discharges by jettisoning of harmful substances is totally prohibited except where safety of life or the ship is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The master or the owner of a ship is required to notify the appropriate authority at least 24 hours prior to loading or unloading such substances. To assist with the implementation of these requirements internationally, the international maritime dangerous goods code is being revised to cover pollution aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the evolutionary change of attitudes to environment protection is reflected in this Bill. With the introduction of these amendments, paragraph (c) of section 250 of the Navigation Act 1912 inserted in 1912 will now be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> This provision authorised the master of a ship to throw overboard any dangerous goods shipped without his knowledge and specifically exempted such a master from any liability whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> Annex IV of the Convention contains regulations for the prevention of pollution by sewage from ships, and applies to all ships over 200 gross tons or those certified to carry more than 10 persons. </PARA>
<PARA> All discharges of sewage from Australian ships are prohibited, except under conditions specified in the Bill. No discharges are permitted within the Great Barrier Reef area. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the discharge requirements, Annex IV contains requirements relating to periodical surveys, and the issue of an international sewage prevention certificate. Valid certificates must be carried on board a ship and be produced when a ship applies for clearance to leave an Australian port. </PARA>
<PARA> Annex V contains regulations for the prevention of pollution by garbage. The complete prohibition placed on the disposal into the sea of plastics, including synthetic ropes and fishing nets, is a feature of this annex. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, specific minimum distances have been set for the disposal of the principal types of garbage, including dunnage. The permissible degree of discharge is directly related to the degradability of the waste. Again, disposal of garbage in the Great Barrier Reef area is prohibited. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that a significant effect of this annex will be a reduction in the quantity of litter and waste material which washes up on to our beaches and coastline. </PARA>
<PARA> From my own experience I know that the beaches in New South Wales, on occasions, suffer this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The cleanliness of Australian beaches should be enhanced as a result of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, there have been complaints from the fishing industry concerning the problems caused by the disposal of garbage at sea. In particular, concern regarding the fouling and consequent damage of fishing nets. For these reasons, I believe the controls proposed by this Bill will be welcomed by all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of these new controls into Commonwealth legislation is based on the legislative arrangements recommended by the Australian Transport Advisory Council, which requires that complementary Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory legislation be enacted before Australia can ratify annexes III, IV and V of Marpol. The proposal is therefore in accordance with long-standing arrangements between the Commonwealth, States and Northern Territory for control of ship-sourced pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> A second aim of the Bill is to update existing legislation to reflect the 1985 amendments to annex II and protocol I of the Marpol convention. These were adopted by the International Maritime Organisation in December 1985, and have also been endorsed by the Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC). </PARA>
<PARA> Annex II deals with the prevention of pollution by noxious liquid substances carried in bulk. These amendments will enter into force internationally on 6 April 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the result of general agreement that the original provisions of annex II, developed in the early 1970s, needed revision to take account of subsequent technical developments. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments are recognised by shipping and pollution specialists in government and the shipping and chemical industries as being more in tune with actual conditions encountered on board chemical tankers than were the original annex II provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally they are designed to make annex II easier for administrations to implement, as the need for on-shore facilities for the reception of chemical wastes is reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to Protocol I of Marpol incorporate new comprehensive mandatory incident reporting requirements. These new pollution reporting obligations and the accompanying guidelines are designed to speed communication, enabling authorities to respond quickly and be better informed in the event of actual or potential accidental spillages, cargo losses, and illegal discharges. </PARA>
<PARA> The simplification and standardisation of ship reporting principles and procedures were the major aims of the Protocol I revision, and have consistently been supported by Australia at international maritime organization meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> The standardised procedures will avoid the confusion caused by the variety of reporting requirements, imposed by individual authorities, as ships move from one area to another. </PARA>
<PARA> As on previous occasions during the development of Marpol, Australia has argued strongly for the special protection measures to safeguard the Great Barrier Reef region. </PARA>
<PARA> Special recognition of this unique area is contained in the Convention. This level of protection is maintained in the proposed amendments, which specifically prohibit discharges of chemicals, sewage and garbage in the reef region. </PARA>
<PARA> The third function of the Bill is to enable Australia to implement the 1984 protocol to the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969. The Convention is implemented in Australia by the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981, which entered into force on 5 February 1984 and will be amended by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The polluter pays concept is contained in the convention and the new protocol, which are designed to ensure that compensation is available to those suffering oil pollution damage as a result of maritime casualties. </PARA>
<PARA> Owners of ships carrying more than 2000 tonnes of oil are required to maintain insurance or other financial security against the risk of such an eventuality. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1984 protocol amending the civil liability convention was developed to overcome the adverse effects of inflation on the real values of the limits of liability. The protocol adopts a minimum for vessels of less than 5,000 gross tons of three million special drawing rights, as defined by the International Monetary Fund. This is equivalent to approximately $A5.8m. </PARA>
<PARA> For larger vessels, liability is calculated on the basis of the vessel's tonnage, with an overall maximum for the ship's liability of 59.7 million SDRS, or $A114.5m. As an example, a tanker of 39,000 gross tons which is insured to a limit of $A10.35m under existing legislation will be required to be insured under the 1984 protocol to a limit of $A33.5m. This reflects a threefold rise in the real value of the level of compensation available, and will ensure that the damage that such a ship can cause will be more effectively compensated. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments effected by the 1984 protocol include extension of the geographic scope of the Convention to cover incidents occurring in the 200-mile zone. </PARA>
<PARA> This will afford additional protection to sensitive areas such as the Great Barrier Reef and safeguard existing and potential fisheries in the Australian fishing zone. </PARA>
<PARA> The scope of the legislation will also be extended as tankers in ballast and combination carriers are now included in the convention coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> Extensive consultations between Federal and State officials resulted in agreement on adoption of the protocol. This was accepted and has been recommended by ATAC Ministers. The text of the protocol has been discussed with industry groups representing insurers, shipowners, and cargo interests, and no objections have been raised. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the benefits to a coastal State of the expanded scope and increased limits provided by the protocol are readily apparent, the additional costs are extremely difficult to predict. </PARA>
<PARA> Shipowners will have to arrange increased insurance cover. However, the nature of shipping insurance, which is provided largely by protection and indemnity clubs on a mutual indemnity basis, makes it impossible to predict the cost involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, whether a cost increase would be reflected in increased freight rates and charges in the existing highly competitive international freight market is far from certain. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill will align references to the tonnage of ships in the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Act 1981, with the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969. Australia is already a party to this latter Convention, which entered into force in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The absolute tonnages of certain types of ships for levy purposes will undergo substantial variation following the determination of new tonnages under the 1969 Convention, although existing ships are not required to be re-measured for tonnage purposes until 1994. </PARA>
<PARA> In the intervening period an owner may opt to measure a ship under the Convention or by the traditional method embodied in the Navigation (Tonnage Measurement) Regulations. The amendment proposed by the Bill will compensate for the variations between each measurement regime and cater for ships whose tonnage has been calculated under either regime. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the amendments contained in the Bill will result in substantial improvement in both the control of ship-sourced pollution and compensation available for damage caused by a pollution incident, and will maintain Australia's position in the international forefront in the field of marine pollution convention implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to obtain parliamentary approval for Australia to take up increases in its capital subscriptions to two international financial institutions-the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that the main activity of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which was established in 1947, is that of providing loans to developing member countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Following an increase in the IMF's quotas in 1983, in August 1984 the governors of the IBRD approved an increase in the authorised capital stock of the IBRD of $US7 billion. This allowed the bank to pursue the practice whereby its members' shareholdings were increased in parallel with their IMF quotas. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1984, governors authorised an additional resolution which provided for those members who had suffered a relative decline in their shareholding to regain their relative share. Australia was one of the countries affected by this resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> The text of the two resolutions, including the number of shares to which each member is entitled to subscribe, is included in the explanatory memorandum to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> These two increases will allow the Bank to expand its borrowing on the world capital markets. It is these borrowings which largely finance the Bank's loans to developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia voted in favour of the resolutions authorising these capital increases. Members, including Australia, are entitled, but not obliged, to subscribe to this authorised increase. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is entitled to subscribe to 745 shares under the special capital increase and to 70 shares under the increase in certain subscriptions to capital stock, a total of 815 shares, valued at $US98.32m. Under these capital increases, 91.25 per cent of the subscription is to remain on call, the other 8.75 per cent ($US8.60m) is to be paid-in. Of the paid-in portion, 10 per cent ($US0.86m) has to be in the form of gold or United States dollars while the balance ($US7.74m) can be in Australian dollars. The latter amount ($A12.29m at the current exchange rate) will be paid in the form of a promissory note. </PARA>
<PARA> The initial 10 per cent cash payment will be made by 31 December 1986. Subject to agreement with the Bank, the promissory note will be encashed in eight equal biannual instalments of approximately $A1.54m each over the five financial years commencing 1986-87. The exact Australian dollar cost will depend on the exchange rate in effect at the time of lodgment of the promissory note. </PARA>
<PARA> The IBRD is an effective and efficient institution in the provision of development assistance to developing countries, and it plays an important role in the South East Asian region. This has been recognised by Australian governments over the years since the Bank's establishment. </PARA>
<PARA> Up to the end of June 1986, the Bank had lent about $US105 billion to its member countries. Projects financed covered all the major sectors of economic development but there has been emphasis on infrastructure facilities in the transport and communications, industry and energy sectors, as well as projects for agriculture, education and water supply. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it to be in Australia's interest to continue its policy of support by taking up, in full, the increase in our capital subscription to which we are entitled under the two resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Finance Corporation, which was established in 1956 as an affiliate of the World Bank, is an international development institution established to promote the growth of productive private investment and to assist enterprises which will contribute to the economic development of its developing member countries. In addition to the direct financial assistance it provides, which may take the form of loan or equity investment, it also arranges other investment finance, mainly from the private sector, to be made available. Up to the end of June 1986, the Corporation had outstanding investments of about $US2.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the need to ensure that the IFC has adequate resources to expand its operations, the governors of the Corporation approved a resolution in December 1985 authorising an increase in the IFC capital of $US650m. This will double the IFC's capital. Australia voted in favour of the resolution. As in the case of the IBRD capital increase, member countries are entitled, but not obliged, to subscribe to additional shares. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is entitled under the resolution, the text of which is set out in the explanatory memorandum, to subscribe to an additional 14,560 shares at a cost of $US14.56m, all of which would be paid-in. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the terms of an amendment to the resolution, the initial payment associated with the additional subscription must be made by 1 February 1987. It is expected that payment of $US5.824m will be made by that date, with the remaining commitment being paid in three annual cash payments of $US2.912m each, beginning in February 1988. The Australian dollar cost of these instalments will depend on the exchange rate in effect at the time of payment.</PARA>
<PARA> The IFC helps to provide the finance, technical assistance and management skills needed to develop productive private sector investment opportunities in its developing member countries. The encouragement of direct foreign investment in developing countries is particularly important given the external debt problems of those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is appropriate therefore for Australia to register its support for the corporation and its activities by taking up its full share entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Bill will have the support of the Opposition. We believe that acts of care and compassion, and the quality of caring, help to characterise any society and the quality of care that is provided for aged Australians is an important part of that provision. However, we believe that the kind of care that is provided should be appropriate to the need. We believe that this legislation, introduced by a government which we do not generally support, is both appropriate and proper and we wish to be associated with it. This legislation will have our general support but we will propose some specific amendments to it in the Committee stage which we hope will improve both its acceptability and its efficiency. We are willing to discuss matters of detail with the Minister for Community Services (Senator Grimes) if that seems appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to discuss several matters separately and seriatim: First, the philosophy underlying the legislation; secondly, certain moves that have been made to transfer regulation making power to gazettal making power; thirdly, certain financing and indexation provisions; and, fourthly, a new capital funding formula contained in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties have a considerable interest in this kind of legislation. After all, the National Health Act 1953, introduced by a Liberal Government under the Menzies Administration, introduced subsidies. The Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 started capital funding in that area. The Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972 introduced funding for hostels and my friend and former colleague, the Honourable Bill Wentworth, was responsible for that legislation. I believe that each of those pieces of legislation enjoyed bipartisan support because they sought to improve the options for Australians entering their last years. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation has come from the Nursing Homes and Hostels Review and it seeks to put into effect some of the findings of that review. It seeks to provide better resources for hostel care in Australia and that is largely what Part II of the legislation is concerned with. It seeks also to make a more rational needs-based provision-that is, needs for care based-of residential care and that is included in Part III of the Bill. The Opposition, in general, supports both of those thrusts. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to talk first about the philosophy underlying the legislation as this is the main import of the Bill. It is a real change in the way we approach the provision of subsidies for aged persons care in Australia. This is the first Bill to set in place some of the proposals in the Nursing Homes and Hostels Review and the changes are sensible and desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has sought, and we have supported, moves to place more emphasis on home care and support, for example, through the home and community care program. We support that approach. This Bill seeks to provide more emphasis for hostel care as a form of sheltered, residential accommodation. That is sensible and desirable and we support that emphasis where it is appropriate. This Bill has sought to place relatively less emphasis on the nursing homes as the main form of residential care for the aged. The Bill is not suggesting that there be less nursing home provision or fewer nursing home beds. It is merely that nursing homes will have a less dominant position in the overall provision and as a percentage of the total provision. I take it that that will be achieved by controlling the increase in the number of new beds. More new beds will be in hostels and fewer new beds will be in nursing homes but not a single nursing home bed need be lost. It is not a question of fewer nursing home beds; it is a question of a different proportion, a different emphasis and a different percentage. </PARA>
<PARA> How should we think about what the government is proposing if we want to evaluate it? Each of us in the Senate, whether we like it or not, is a potential user of the services we are talking about today, if we live long enough. It makes good sense to me as a potential user of services. It makes good sense to me to be able to stay in my own home setting for as long as possible and it makes good sense to me, as a user of services, to be able to stay in the most independent class of accommodation for as long as possible and, if I need sheltered residential care, to go into a nursing home only when I have to. That is what I want as a potential user and this legislation takes us down that track. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, thinking about the ones I love, I want the same kind of emphasis for my relatives. I know from my medical practice, from my time as a doctor, what nursing homes look like, what they feel like and what they smell like and I know what hostels look like. I certainly know that there is a world of difference between them. If there is an appropriate need for one class and not the other, fine, let us have the nursing home care. But if it is possible to go to hostels I think it is a better, more pleasant and more desirable way to live. I have seen in the past people who could have been in hostels with more independence, more enjoyment of life, more activity and more personal sovereignty. On the other hand I have seen people accommodated in nursing homes because no alternatives were available. They needed care and they could not find care except in nursing homes. I have seen people go to nursing homes because they did not understand that there were alternative ways of seeking residential care. One of the things that this legislation may help us do is make more widely known what the alternatives are. I have seen people go to nursing homes because they had been in a queue and they wished to take up an available bed rather than wait until their need for care required a nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA> To look at these changes to the legislation as a taxpayer is not my main concern but it is not my least. I have talked about my concern as a user of services and as a relative but if I look at this legislation as a taxpayer I find the proposals attractive. Not only are nursing homes sometimes the less appropriate choice but also they are much more costly in terms of public subsidy. For every $1 spent by the taxpayer on a hostel bed, $4.30 is spent by the same taxpayer on a private, participating nursing home bed. For every $1 spent on a hostel bed, $5.63 is spent by the taxpayer on a deficit-funded nursing home bed. I can get several points from that. First, it is expensive to operate nursing homes but, where nursing homes are necessary, let us spend that money gladly. Secondly, deficit-funded nursing homes are more than 25 per cent more expensive to the taxpayer than the private participating nursing homes. I hope that the Government will look at that difference as well and try to tell us why it exists and whether we wish to maintain it. If, the need is expressed to us by many Australians, say, members of the Council on the Ageing and members of senior citizens organisations, if their priorities indicate that more hostels would suit them and if it is cost effective to concentrate on hostel provision, it makes good sense to go down that path. </PARA>
<PARA> I comment briefly that the Senate has taken an interest in the question of residential care for the aged. A report from the Senate on some of the achievements and some of the problems within the nursing home and other aged accommodation areas came down not so long ago. It drew attention to some of the problems. It drew attention to some of the standards of care. It drew attention to some of the needs for care and some of the inappropriate features of the care which is provided. I notice that some members of that Committee, the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes, are on the speakers list in this debate. I hope that, during the debate, they will put some of their views about what is an appropriate form of care. </PARA>
<PARA> I have seen a change in the pattern of nursing home use over recent times. This is partly related to the increasing numbers of Australians who are reaching retirement age, the age of 65 or 70, the increasing numbers of Australians who are becoming what we call `aged aged'-people over 80 years of age-and the increasing need which these people have for some form of residential accommodation. So the numbers are increasing. It is an interesting observation that, whereas 1 1/2 per cent of all Australians aged between 65 and 74 require residential accommodation and whereas 8.5 per cent of all Australians in the next 10-year age group-75 to 84 years of age-need residential accommodation, something like 37 per cent of Australians who are 85 years or older need residential accommodation. As the population is ageing, as Australians are greying, our needs are increasing. </PARA>
<PARA> The other change I have seen in nursing home accommodations has been that more and more occupants of nursing homes seem to have a genuine need for care, and a genuine need for quite heavy care in some cases. It may not be known to all honourable senators that the nursing homes have a very great turnover. In the first six months following admission as many as half the patients may no longer be there. Some of them may have needed to come in for only a short time; some of them, of course, may have died. But there is a large turnover and, as the Government has brought in assessment teams, we see more and more people in nursing homes who need that form of care. This has put a strain on the people who provide nursing home beds and who run the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I have looked at the proposed changes. Let me look now at the changes from the point of view of the nursing home industry. Put very simply, the industry-has expressed to me the view that the interests of the sick and aged are being put at risk by the proposals in the legislation. I am not sure whether that is correct. I read this in a full page newspaper advertisement which you, Mr Acting Deputy President, may have seen last week. I will quote part of the advertisement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . ever increasing aged population of Australia will be deprived of any real chance to be accommodated, if they so wish, in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA>I might discuss that in a moment. I think it is incorrect, but that is the kind of concern being expressed from within the industry. It has been expressed to me by some sections of the industry that they should be permitted to build nursing home beds wherever they want and wherever a demand exists. We might discuss that. It has been put to me further by the industry that a Federal Minister prescribes the number of residential places, their type and location, that the Minister has set up assessment teams to determine who may enter nursing home beds and that he prescribes the fee that may be charged. As a result, the nursing home industry has said to me, patients have no choice in the base services available-they are what the nursing home can afford. By the way, that is probably part of the reason why the deficit-funded nursing homes are more expensive-they offer more services. It has also been put to me that patients have no choice in extra services because the fees are fixed. The industry further asserts that the proprietors have no choice in the type of services and no choice in the level of fee. They are arguing for a deregulated system. I understand that part of the industry has actually approached the High Court of Australia and presently a decision is reserved before the High Court challenging the Commonwealth power and practice in this area. That High Court decision will be both important and instructive when it emerges in time.</PARA>
<PARA> I have listened very carefully to the industry concerns. I do not believe, and I have no evidence to lead me to agree with, the industry assertion that the interests of sick and aged Australians are being put at risk by these proposals. Although I hear the industry's concerns, I cannot accept that that is the case. I cannot accept the assertion that these proposals will mean that the increasing aged population of Australia will be deprived of any real chance to be accommodated if they so wish in nursing homes. That is simply not true. What it indicates is that people in the industry who are knowledgeable and experienced and who are worried about this legislation have simply got it wrong. As to the assertion that beds should be built wherever demand exists, that will be fine if only the industry will then tell me that it does not want subsidies from the taxpayer to be attached to each of those beds when they do exist. The difficulty with that approach and argument, however sympathetic one is to the job those people are doing, is that there is substantial subsidy of everything they do. The private nursing home industry in Australia provides the beds and every approved bed attracts a heavy subsidy from the taxpayer. So the taxpayer does have an interest. </PARA>
<PARA> If we got to a system where not every bed was subsidised and some beds could be built without attracting subsidy, we might have a completely different situation. But at the moment every nursing home bed is subsidised. There is a taxpayer interest and because of that the call for a completely free and deregulated system simply does not make sense. While ever the Commonwealth is called on to subsidise every nursing home bed, the Commonwealth can properly seek power over the numbers and kinds of beds. I believe that on this matter we support the Minister in what he is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the provisions in the Bill which seek to replace certain regulations with gazettals. One of the reasons that we have sought to have regulations in place over the years is to give the Parliament a capacity to overturn any regulation which seems inappropriate in the light of current standards or current practice. A continuing major concern of the Liberal Party and the National Party is that matters which are the subject of ministerial determination should generally be capable of disallowance if the Parliament finds them objectionable in some way. Although that power has been there, I cannot recall when we last had to seek to move such a disallowance. It is simply that having the power there leaves with the Parliament a residual capacity. Using regulation power, the Minister has usually made his determinations known by subordinate legislation via regulations and ordinances. But I understand that the preparation and the processing of these is slow; it is tedious; it is subject to the speed and availability of parliamentary drafting. From my own time as a Minister I know that it used to drive me mad trying to get regulations drafted. The general proposition put by the Minister and by the Department that a move from regulations to gazettal will be quicker and simpler is one which we accept, provided that the gazettal notices themselves remain disallowable by either House of Parliament. After all, all we are seeking to do is to ensure that the possibility of parliamentary scrutiny remains. If that scrutiny remains, if the gazettals remain disallowable, that would seem to have merit. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point to the Minister that at least one of the gazettals has not been made disallowable. Clause 7 (2), I think, creates a new gazettal which is not disallowable. I am told that it is a power under which no action has ever been taken and under which no action is contemplated. If that is the case, if it has never been used, there is no real point in moving it to gazettals and there should be no real point against leaving it as a regulation-making power. If it is to be made a gazettal, we ask that it be a disallowable gazettal. We will vote against that sub-clause unless the Minister can give us some good reason why we should not do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to financing. The Bill provides for measures to increase the amount of subsidy for a hostel sector. We congratulate the Government and we welcome the move. It will enable the better provision of hostel accommodation. I welcome the increase and the indexation moves of hostel fees. It will make hostel provision easier to afford and easier to finance. A new capital funding formula which is contained in the Bill will make it easier for some organisations to obtain capital subsidies. Organisations which are regarded as being in special need categories will be able to attract a 100 per cent subsidy. The Minister will be able to designate certain facilities as special need facilities, and the Minister seeks to be able to designate certain beds in nursing homes as special need beds. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not worried about the proposition in general; we have a couple of particular questions. In relation to the designation of, say, a special need organisation and the granting to that organisation of a 100 per cent subsidy, it is very important that there be public confidence in ministerial decisions so to do. We are not objecting to it as a principle, but we believe it is appropriate that such a decision be capable of disallowance within the Parliament. I cannot remember when we last moved to disallow one of the Minister's regulations, but the fact that the power is there gives us a very powerful argument against anyone who says it is unfettered ministerial discretion. It is not, because, while there is a disallowance power, we can always come back to the Parliament. We are asking the Minister to agree to an amendment to make the granting of 100 per cent subsidies, where he considers that necessary, capable of disallowance. I do not imagine that we will want to disallow it, but as a principle it should be disallowable. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter in relation to special need beds is a more difficult one, and I hope the Minister can give us some assistance on this. I believe clause 13 of the Bill says that upon application by the owner of a nursing home `or otherwise' the Minister may do certain things. Why are the words `or otherwise' there? They suggest that the Minister may designate certain beds as special need beds without the owner of the nursing home having sought such a change. If we are talking about a private participating nursing home, which I might own and which might be my life investment, it may not suit me to have certain beds designated as special need beds. I ask the Minister: Why are the words `or otherwise' there? If we are not convinced that there is an overwhelming reason, we will seek to move an amendment to have those words struck out. That would merely have the effect of providing the Minister with a capacity to redesignate certain beds in private nursing homes only if the proprietor so sought. We think that is a perfectly simple proposition. Unless the Minister can tell us that there is some overwhelming reason for the words `or otherwise' to remain, we will seek to have them removed. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point again to the Minister that we are supporting this legislation, but we are trying to make it so that what goes on under the legislation not only is fair but also can be seen to be fair. We think it is desirable and necessary that any ministerial decision either to grant 100 per cent capital funding or to redefine certain beds be seen to be impartial, non-punitive, and non-party political-in fact, totally non-political. </PARA>
<PARA> Associated with all this is the decision to control tightly and with minimum flexibility-even minimum flexibility for the Minister-the number of beds which may be allocated to a particular region or a particular town, or in relation to a particular application. The Minister may identify the number of beds in a State or a Territory, but we have discovered within States or Territories certain regional needs which arise, perhaps unpredictably. We do not object to the desire of the Government to alter the ratio of beds to favour hostel provision, and we understand that this will happen by adding relatively fewer nursing home beds and relatively more hostel beds. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem remains that some areas are atypical. Perhaps they are atypical in terms of demography; perhaps a difference in their demography emerges. They may be different in terms of the numbers of migrants in particular areas. I can think of areas of Sydney which have changed very markedly as particular migrant communities have moved in. The residents of certain areas of Sydney are aging at different rates from those for other areas. I can imagine different growth rates for different towns. One has only to look at the north coast of New South Wales, which is growing at about five times the rate of the rest of the State. One can see that local needs may emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not want to second guess the Minister. We do not want to take out of the Minister's hands the planning and designation of numbers of beds. We are asking, however, that a capacity remain with the Minister of the day such that if he or she thinks a local need has arisen he or she can vary the number by gazettal. That should be disallowable; we should keep the process clean. We will move an amendment to ensure that the Minister has such a capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said all of that, we are attracted to what this legislation is seeking to do. It is seeking to help elderly Australians to live their lives with more autonomy, more control, more dignity, more choice and more flexibility. It is seeking to provide more appropriate accommodation for many of them through the provision of more hostel beds. The Opposition wishes to be associated with the legislation. In the interests of comity, we ask the Minister to look at our proposed amendments favourably. We believe they are designed to improve the legislation, and we hope that some of them will be accepted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Bill 1986 is welcomed in general by the Australian Democrats. This legislation is designed to take what we consider to be appropriate action on some of the recommendations of the report of the Nursing Homes and Hostels Review which was tabled in April this year. It introduces arrangements for controlling the growth of nursing home beds. As a consequence, it is estimated that the Government will save $4m in 1986-87 and $27.7m in 1987-88. On the other hand, increases in hostel and personal care subsidy levels and the introduction of automatic indexation in these levels will increase expenditure on care for the aged by an estimated $5.6m in 1986-87 and $26.5m in 1987-88.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Nursing Homes and Hostels Review report recommended that aged and disabled people should, as far as possible, be supported in their own homes and their own communities, that aged and disabled people should be supported by residential services only where other support systems are not appropriate to meet their needs. The review report said that services should be provided in an atmosphere and using processes which promote, as far as possible, rehabilitation and restoration of function. The manner in which services are provided should develop and enhance personal freedom and independent functioning of all residents. Services should be based on a recognition that for many people discharge to a residential service providing a less intensive form of care or a community-based support service would be a possible and desirable outcome. The Australian Democrats fully support these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> Since April the Commonwealth has been in consultation with State governments, nursing homes and hostels, consumer and welfare groups, and so on. With this legislation the Government is acting upon two of some five areas of need which were identified in these discussions. Those two areas that are the subject of this legislation are the need for a more flexible and integrated planning approach to the provision of residential services and the need for a publicised and better resourced hostel sector. To provide for this, the Bill introduces growth control arrangements for nursing homes. The Minister will be able to specify the maximum number of nursing home beds which can exist at any time during a financial year in each State or Territory and in the regions of each State or Territory. These maxima will be gazetted. </PARA>
<PARA> The strategy is to maintain growth in new services on the basis of the current national ratio of 100 residential care places per 1,000 people aged 70 years or over and, with this national ratio, to limit the rate of growth of numbers of new nursing home beds to a maximum of 10 per cent of new approvals. By 1988-89 the Government will approve an additional 12,880 places overall, of which up to 1,295 places will be for nursing homes and the balance for hostels. It is clear that in a great many cases the sort of accommodation with the sort of personal care, supports and rehabilitation services provided by hostels for people who need moderate levels of assistance and supervision in their daily lives is preferable. While nursing homes provide extensive nursing care for highly dependent people there are currently many inappropriate placements because of the lack of hostel-type accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also addresses that area in which currently, under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954, the Commonwealth makes grants to eligible organisations towards the capital cost of homes for the aged and disabled, that amount not being able to exceed 80 per cent of the capital cost. This legislation introduces the ability to meet the special needs of groups such as Aboriginal groups, ethnic communities, the aged and the disabled, such as the deaf or blind aged, by enabling them to receive grants of an amount up to the full capital cost of the provision of such accommodation. The Bill will also apply uniform conditions of approval to both government and non-government nursing homes. Existing provisions exempt government nursing homes from the conditions which relate to the number of beds in an approved nursing home and the approval of patients for admission. However, in practice government homes have been subjected to restrictions since 1981, and this legislation formalises these restraints. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act to provide for increases in the hostel care subsidy, respite care subsidy and personal care subsidy. The hostel care subsidy will increase from $1.80 a day to $1.95 a day; the respite care subsidy from $7 a day to $7.50 a day; and the personal care subsidy from $7.80 a day to $8.40 a day. There will also be an additional increase of $2.60 a day in the value of the personal care subsidy, to $11 a day, from May next year, to assist the hostel industry to provide more adequate levels of personal care for dependent elderly people. The Bill will also, importantly, provide a mechanism for annual automatic increases in subsidy rates for hostel care, personal care and respite care. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats welcome any moves to provide for and support alternatives in care for the aging in our society. It is significant, however, that this legislation covers only two of the areas raised in the consultations undertaken by the Government since April-those which I mentioned before, namely the requirement for flexible planning and the need for a publicised and better resourced hostel sector. It will be important that the remaining three areas be also dealt with by government if we are to meet the needs of our aged people, the continuing needs of an increasing section of the community. Those other three areas related to the extension of residential care services beyond hostels to other forms of accommodation such as group housing arrangements, the expansion of community services to assist those elderly people most at risk of premature and inappropriate institutionalisation and the importance of carefully developing the process of assessment so that it will gain support from consumers, professionals and service providers. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Australian Democrats support the measures in the Bill which provide for the extension of the provision of hostel accommodation, which will introduce a much needed increase in flexibility in the care for the aged, we are concerned that the assumption should not be made that this can be done by the simple redirection of resources from nursing homes to hostels. In a population in which the percentage of older people is increasing, the need for nursing homes will not necessarily decrease along with the provision of additional hostel beds and community services. While it is no doubt the case that a considerable number of people currently in nursing homes-a quite high proportion, quite possibly-could more appropriately be placed in hostel accommodation or cared for in other ways in the community, doubts exist, at least in Victoria, about the assumption which appears to exist that there is a clear demarcation line between hostel and extensive care patients. If, as seems likely under the new provisions, Victoria is facing a possible reduction of some 25 per cent in available nursing home beds, this is cause for concern because it it believed that only around 10 to 12 per cent of current nursing home patients could actually suitably be moved to hostel-type accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> Adding the many nursing home-type patients who are currently occupying acute care beds in both public and private hospitals to the long waiting lists already existing for nursing home placements illustrates that there are potential problems. So it will indeed be important that the commitment of the Minister for Community Services (Senator Grimes), given in his second reading speech, that the change in the existing balance between providing intensive care through nursing homes and providing appropriate community services and hostel options will be implemented gradually. The Minister said that he recognises that it is essential that implementation does not affect the people who are already residents of nursing homes and that it is carefully monitored, evaluated and, where necessary, adjusted. The Australian Democrats strongly support those comments of the Minister and will be encouraging such flexibility, graduality and adjustments as they become necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> We particularly welcome the measures in the Bill to maintain the real levels of the hospital subsidies and to increase the other available assistance which has been outlined. In particular, we welcome the provision in the legislation for the annual automatic increases. This annual indexation is quite essential when dealing with the provision of financial benefit to people in need in the community at all levels. Indexation is a practice which recently has probably been more honoured in the breach than actually carried out. All I can do is hope that this Parliament will not be party to any further legislation such as that in respect of the increases expected by pensioners through indexation of their pensions, and that indeed this annual indexation will continue in effect. We also welcome what we see as an affirmative action component in this legislation-the ability provided by the legislation for special needs groups of financially disadvantaged people in our community to achieve 100 per cent support for capital funding. This applies to such groups as ethnic groups in the community, the Aboriginal community and the aged handicapped, who will indeed benefit from this provision whereby they can receive 100 per cent support as against the regular provision of 80 per cent. This is most welcome from the point of view of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> As we have said, however, there is a great deal more to be done if we are to meet the needs of our aging population. Much of that will require very close and well considered State and Federal co-operation. Concern has been expressed at least by one organisation in Victoria about the replacement of the Federal-State co-ordinating committees by the aged care advisory committees. It will be very important that that State-Federal co-operation be continued and developed as further developments occur in care for the aged. We welcome the Minister's statement about the objective of this new arrangement for the setting up of the aged care advisory committees:</PARA>
<PARA>to ensure that in planning residential care services full account is taken of the availability of community care services; the involvement of consumer bodies and service providers and the continuing and essential contribution of State authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is a significant comment by the Minister, and will need to be carried out if that co-operation is to be effective and further action of and innovative nature is to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the areas that needs to be recognised at all levels and needs to be acted upon if we are to provide adequate service, both residential and in the community and the home, relates to the shortage of professional staff. For example, not enough medical practitioners are undertaking training in geriatric medicine and rehabilitation either under the auspices of the Royal Australian College of Physicians or at the diploma level through the Mount Royal course. Similarly, in the area of geriatric nursing or gerontology training for nurses, wider availability is needed and higher priority needs to be given to funding these courses. There is also a shortage of other allied health professionals with knowledge or experience in the care and understanding of the needs of the elderly. It is important that the obvious problems of recruitment and retention of professional staff are examined and faced so that these people do not continue to move out of the care of the aged and into acute health care services, leaving an enormous gap, particularly in rehabilitation and community care. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area to which considerable attention should be paid is that of research into gerontological studies. It is interesting to note that in 1985-86 just a little over $1m of the National Health and Medical Research Council's $50.8m research allocation was allocated to research into the aging process. That area is of some concern, particularly in terms of Alzheimer's disease, which according to figures that have been quoted, is likely to affect some 200,000 people by the beginning of the next century. If one takes into account the families of those people, at least 500,000 Australians will be directly affected. It is an area in which we do not have enough knowledge and into which we need to put a great deal more effort. It is already a growing effort, but it needs to be recognised as a priority area, not just from the point of view of the aging but from that of the carers, very often the families. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area where beneficial research could take place, and research which if successful could have a significant impact, is that of incontinence. It is recognised that some 70 per cent of patients in nursing homes have some degree of incontinence. It is often the straw that breaks the camel's back and leads to moving people from home care, where their families have been able to manage, into some form of institutional care. The increase in the number of hostel beds will probably bring about more appropriate placement of such people. If there were to be a breakthrough in research in prevention and treatment, I believe that it would have a significant impact on the costs of caring for the aged, not to mention the comfort of the aged and the ability of their families and other carers in the community to take care of them for longer and at less expense. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet another area that needs to be examined arises from the finding of the report entitled `Census of the Aged in Institutions' which indicated that 85 per cent to 95 per cent of persons admitted to residential care are without a partner. It is interesting to consider the link between the lone aged and the institutionalised aged. We need to look at the reasons why so many persons without partners are admitted and the level of support that is available for those who care for their partners at home before institutionalisation takes place. The carer's pension was introduced in November 1985 and has gone some way to make it possible for those other than partners to take care of people-not just the aged but the disabled as well-in the home. This is seen by all, I am sure, as the best possible option. There are some problems, however. Social security or other pension beneficiaries are not eligible, and it has been said that perhaps the only group within social security beneficiaries who might benefit from a transfer to a carer's pension might be the unemployed, who upon transferring to the carer's pension would do better out of the fringe benefits available. </PARA>
<PARA> A little lateral thinking in this respect could perhaps provide some initiative that would lead to the availability of more people who are prepared to be carers of the aged in the community and in their homes. In Victoria the Australian Democrats have developed a scheme known as the community services initiative, which gives the unemployed the opportunity to provide services in the community, such as those needed by the elderly who wish to remain in their own homes. It involves the provision of services such as the replacement of light bulbs, helping to make telephone calls, hanging out washing, driving the car, doing the shopping, simply visiting, reading, talking, all the points of social contact that are so important to people who are not able to do those things for themselves. They involve the carrying out of simple physical actions which anyone, certainly unskilled but caring people, could easily carry out. This scheme would operate by allowing the permissible income level of social security, particularly unemployment beneficiaries to be raised so that they could earn a higher income-in this case provided by the government in the form of a carer's income, which together with the unemployment benefit would reach the level of an award wage payable for such work. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned Alzheimer's disease. I am told by people working in Alzheimer's support groups that there is support for families at local government level, but that a great many families who could use such support are not aware that it is available; that is probably a good thing because if all people were aware of the availability of services-this applies to Alzheimer's as well as to other problems-demand on those services would escalate to the point where in current circumstances there would not be enough people to provide those services. It seems to the Australian Democrats that a scheme such as the community services initiative, in which government would play its role in a much less expensive way than institutionalisation, would enable unemployed people to retain benefits, carry out the important community work of keeping elderly people in their homes, supporting and caring for them and helping them to cope with their daily lives. With that payment on top of their unemployment benefit, they would be able to earn an award wage for the work. If local government were to administer such a scheme, there would be a far larger pool of people to call upon to provide such services. In summary therefore, the Australian Democrats welcome the widening of options for the aged, which this Bill represents. We caution against any view that reductions can or should be achieved in the numbers of nursing home beds or in spending on care for the aged and we urge still further innovative actions to ensure the best possible care and the widest possible options for Australia's aging population. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Bill 1986 is, to my great satisfaction, receiving a great deal of cross-party support in the Senate and not without very good reason. It comes to us as a result of many years of work, starting with the Auditor-General's report nearly 10 years ago on an efficiency audit of the Commonwealth administration of nursing homes programs. This was followed by a House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure report entitled `In a home or at home: accommodation and home care for the aged' and more recently a report by the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes entitled `Private nursing homes in Australia: their conduct, administration and ownership'. After years of seeming inactivity, we now have a fairly prompt response to that most recent report which was tabled at the end of 1984 and to the Nursing Homes and Hostels Review from the newly formed Department of Community Services, which appeared about six or eight months ago. That review was followed very promptly by this series of amendments to the nursing homes and hostels legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a long overdue approach to a problem which was becoming more and more difficult for the Australian Government to deal with in any rational fashion. In short, all those reports came to a consensus on a range of issues. One of the most remarkable of these was the haphazard manner in which nursing home programs have been launched in Australia, the lack of control that has been exerted over the years and the excessive concentration on institutional accommodation, rather than on the development of a comprehensive range of home and community care programs. Other issues included the failure to develop effective assessment and rehabilitative procedures in order to improve the efficiency of programs by matching services to individuals' particular requirements, the lack of co-ordination between various levels of government, including a lack of co-ordination in the area of inspection and maintenance of standards and in many parts of Australia the lack of concern of the third tier of government-that is local government-to become involved in the provision of these services. Finally and not least there was the inefficiency of the present funding mechanisms, including the lack of rationale for perpetuating both deficit-funded and participating nursing home arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In the period from 1969 to 1984 we saw that uncontrolled growth in nursing home accommodation to which the review referred. In 1969 the number of nursing home beds per thousand population over the age of 65 was 39.1. In 1983 this increased to 47.4 beds per thousand of the population in that age group. That may or may not have been a reasonable growth, but during that period no assessment was ever made of what was a reasonable ratio of beds per thousand of the population; of whether we were looking at the population aged 65 and over or 70 and over; of whether the provision of beds was appropriate to the needs; and all the other issues that I have included in the consensus that has been reached by the three reviews that have been undertaken over the past 10 years. This uncontrolled growth also demonstrated the enormous increase in public expenditure on nursing home beds. </PARA>
<PARA> The point can never be made too strongly or too frequently that the vast majority of our aged population is very healthy and very capable of looking after itself. When we talk about assisted accommodation of whatever degree, we are talking about only 7 per cent of our population over the age of 70. Another point should be made as well: As the population ages progressively, we have more healthy 70-year-olds. Certainly amongst our population aged 85 and over there are more severely handicapped people or elderly people who are restricted by their physical and mental aging, but amongst the 70 to 80-year age group there are many very healthy, lively, intelligent, capable and independent people. This is something of which I became aware when I, as a young woman involved in community activities, offered my services to the local meals on wheels association, only to find that the majority of the helpers were people in the age group that was normally expected to be dependent upon meals on wheels and other services of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The specifics of this legislation go very closely to many of the recommendations of the most recent review-that from the Department of Community Services. In looking forward for the first time in a manner which seeks to provide in an appropriate way for our aging population, that review has made recommendations for the control of the development of nursing home beds, for the ratio that will be developed in comparison with hostels and less heavily supported accommodation. There were similar recommendations from the previous reports to which I have referred, so that we can now look towards the next five or 10 years and set some goals within overall maximum ratios. We seek within those time periods to ensure that nursing home beds are made available where they are needed and that where they are not needed different types of accommodation are made available. We are looking also to the fact that in many cases extensive nursing care growth requirements can be met by re-absorbing existing ordinary bed care stock. It may not be widely appreciated that in addition to the ordinary subsidy to which nursing homes are entitled for beds that are held by people in need of an ordinary level of nursing care, there is also an extensive bed subsidy of $42 a week for people who are in need of heavy nursing care. This tends to vary a great deal from State to State, as does the adequacy or otherwise of nursing home bed provision generally. For example, we see in Victoria a ratio of 39 nursing home beds per thousand of population, as against 54.7 in Western Australia. This means that the fewer beds per thousand of population in Victoria are more likely to be occupied by more heavily dependent patients. This is reflected by the fact that there is a higher ratio of trained nurses required in Victorian nursing homes, which leads again to the fact that historically a much higher subsidy has developed in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> The disparities between the States are also of considerable concern. In the future extensive nursing bed requirements may certainly become much higher if we seek to accommodate a far higher proportion of our current nursing home population in much less heavily dependent accommodation. Ultimately, it may very well be that the nursing homes will be for extensive nursing care only, as for something much more closely allied to extensive nursing care than is the case at present. </PARA>
<PARA> As we look carefully at the nursing home industry, we see that, dependent upon the State, the location and the cost of the nursing home beds, in many cases there are beds that are inappropriately occupied by people who would be much better catered for by much less heavily serviced care. The point has already been made on several occasions this morning that that is not only unnecessarily expensive and wasteful of resources but also is certainly of no assistance to the individual concerned, who should be encouraged in every possible way to maintain his or her independence, to maintain a lively interest in what is going on and not to be identified with a heavily dependent group of people. </PARA>
<PARA> The comments made by Senator Peter Baume about the power of the Minister to redesignate beds under these amendments is a matter to which the Minister for Community Services (Senator Grimes) will respond. But it seems to me that this really goes to the heart of the problem that has developed over the years-to the fact that the nursing home industry has developed not necessarily in response to the needs of populations but that other matters have intervened between those needs and the services that are provided. As the Senate is very well aware, much of the provision of nursing home care has been through the private enterprise sector. In many cases it has been the case that services have developed where that resource has been sought to be invested. Each of us is aware in each State of a suburb notorious for the high number of beds that have been provided within that sector. In Western Australia I suppose I look at Mount Lawley, an area where traditionally large old homes have been converted into nursing homes over the years, some appropriately and some not so appropriately. They have not necessarily developed in response to the actual needs of individuals in that area, but have developed far more from a range of accidents, including the properties available for sale and the socio-economic mix of that area, with perhaps more people able to afford private nursing home care. It is in cases like this, where there really is a very poor distribution of beds, or rather an inappropriate distribution of beds, that it may certainly be necessary for the Minister to step in and say: `In the course of rationalising what is going on in this region we are aware of the fact that, for example, there is no accommodation for very young people who may need nursing home attention'. This is one of the increasingly regrettable aspects of nursing home care: It is the appropriate care for very severely disabled young people; for example, those who have suffered from very severe head injuries as a result of road accidents. They may have no other opportunity of accommodation except in nursing homes and special provisions must be made for them. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the inquiry of the Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes, we visited a most stimulating institution in Sydney called Austin which accommodates young people in a much less restricted way which is far more appropriate for them. Of course, they must be provided with education and training. Perhaps more than the elderly population, they must be provided with the stimulus that allows them to develop as individuals. Many of them can look forward to quite a long life, but in wheelchairs or in even more restrictive circumstances. For example, a particular region where there are no beds of this nature may very well be a matter that should concern the Minister and should lead to the recategorisation of beds in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Other services that are very scarce on the ground in many areas are those of particular use to migrants. The extra services that may be required by migrants probably go to the provision of staff who have language skills and who have extra knowledge of the cultural needs of particular groups of migrants. Once again, it may well be up to the Minister to ensure that in a particular area a more appropriate service is available to those people. Once again, in the course of our select committee inquiry, we were given evidence from the Sunshine area of Victoria that fairly recently four new nursing homes had been built but that none of them had been equipped with a range of services most appropriate for the people in that area, which included large numbers of elderly migrants who within the next 10 or 15 years would be looking for nursing home accommodation. Not only were those elderly people unable to afford the accommodation that had recently been provided in the area but also the accommodation was inappropriate. The migrant population would probably be forced to go to nursing homes or other accommodation away from their families without any assurance that their particular needs would be sensitively dealt with. </PARA>

That is a matter for which the Government should have considerable concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has also been mentioned this morning, the provision of particular care for elderly patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease leaves a great deal to be desired. This indeed may lead to considerable extra expense if the appropriate arrangements are to be made. The average dementia patient may well be highly ambulant and must regrettably be restricted to an area for his or her good. One of the most distressing aspects of my career as a trade union official regularly visiting nursing homes was to have the front door unlocked before I could go in. The door was not locked to keep me out; it was locked to keep the patients in. Nursing homes that are well equipped to deal with dementia patients typically have large gardens and the gardens are surrounded by high fences-again not a very palatable state of affairs but one that is absolutely essential for the safety of those people. Of course, within those high fences one must have very well trained staff-people with the time, the sensitivity and the skills required to ensure that the dementia patients have a level of existence which is as valuable to them as possible, with the least number of restraints and the largest possible range of good care, and high quality of life. These are matters that we all seek to achieve. They will not be achieved without considerable expense, and much of the emphasis of these amendments is towards redistributing the very large amount of money that has been spent over the years which, as we are all aware, has gone in many cases into an inappropriate range of care. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to touch briefly on another paper that has come to us fairly recently-the draft discussion paper on quality of care in nursing homes that has been prepared by Catherine Rhys-Hearn, following a very long, detailed and scholarly survey of means of establishing measures for standards of nursing home care. This has been breaking very new ground in many respects. Quantifying and qualifying the level of care of individuals is not something which is done quickly or easily. The report itself is worthy of close scrutiny. In a few minutes, I certainly cannot do it justice. But I note that clause 7 of the Bill points briefly to a very vexed question, one that has been dealt with in industrial arbitration courts at various times. The definition of `nursing home care' is what I am referring to-or, rather, the way in which one can actually interpret a statement which talks about nursing home care or nursing care. I note, anyway, that at least the explanatory memorandum goes to something of a tautology where it states:</PARA>
<PARA>The definition of `nursing home care' in sub-section 4 (1) of the Principal Act provides that `nursing home care' means accommodation and nursing care of a kind provided in a nursing home and includes any prescribed service of a kind provided in a nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment simplifies the mechanism contained in the definition for approving services. This is another matter that will no longer be prescribed by regulation but, much more appropriately, by being specified by the Minister by notice in writing published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. </PARA>
<PARA> The question, `What is nursing?', has been approached in many different ways. I cannot express any surprise at the tautology which has resulted here. We have tried in the past to defend the right of a nurse assistant, for example, to an increased rate of pay by describing her duties within a nursing home. It is very clear that in many cases those duties are extremely responsible. Of course, they are always supervised by the registered general nurse, but they go to all those nurturing services to which patients are entitled but which, in many cases, are seen in the wider community as the sort of care that any of us would give at home to our families, even when they are in good health, and certainly when they are sick, and certainly to the aged in our families when they are in need of that extra care. As Senator Powell has said, one of the most problematic characteristics of aging may be the development of incontinence. It is a matter which in the last few years has begun to receive the sort of scientific approach that has been lacking in the past. But these are the matters that are all dealt with very well and thoroughly and very professionally by Catherine Rhys-Hearn in her discussion paper on quality of care in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not be too long in the future before we are able to say quite categorically that this range of patients with this particular need requires this particular number of registered nursing hours of care per day, that those registered nursing hours should be supported by a certain number of so-called untrained nursing hours, and that in addition-this is going a little more widely than these amendments-that nursing care should also be supported by a range of domestic services within any institution. Too often in the past the nurses, both registered and otherwise, have had to spend a great deal of their time in cleaning, washing, cooking and other duties which are outside the immediate care of the patient and which deprive nurses of time to spend on high quality caring for the individual. </PARA>
<PARA> One other point that I should like to make, which goes also to questions that have been raised in all the reviews over the years, concerns the matter of developing some sort of complaints procedure. Too often elderly people, particularly, who spend their latter years in institutions of one sort or another have been without any advocate for their own particular needs. As Senator Powell said, very many of them are without a partner, very many of them are without any close relatives at all. The question of providing an advocate for individuals in this position is one that certainly concerned the Select Committee and I understand that it is being dealt with within the Department of Community Services in consultation with the Attorney-General's Department. Of course, in most cases well run services have by definition a very good relationship with their client, and the vast majority of nurses and administrators in nursing homes are sensitive, just and sympathetic people. Too often, though, the consumer is frightened to complain, feels powerless and thinks that any complaint may be followed by an eviction order-in many cases, of course, quite incorrectly; but the perception is there. In many cases they are unaware of the fact that they are not getting the degree of care that they deserve. In many cases, too, the relatives feel powerless to take any sort of action. </PARA>
<PARA> We are looking at various advocacy models, not just in the residential context, and we are actively investigating options through a range of innovative projects. This will also apply to our disability services program, where again we have a very large clientele of people who in the past have held those same characteristics as the aged-an unwillingness to complain, a feeling of power- lessness, and perhaps a lack of knowledge about the level of care to which they are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I may say once again how pleased I am that we are receiving such wide support, not only in the Senate but in the community generally, for the amendments to the Act and for the very wide range of recommendations upon which they are based. It has taken a very long time, but it seems to me that within the next five or 10 years we can look forward to a range of supportive mechanisms within Australian society which will be far more appropriate to our aging population. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing the Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Bill 1986. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill, but there are some aspects of it about which I should like to speak briefly. For some time I was a member of the Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes, and I had the opportunity of moving around a great deal of Australia and looking at nursing homes, and at hospitals and hostels. I do want to pay tribute to private enterprise, to the churches and the benevolent societies who do so much in this area of the provision of nursing homes and hostels. I like some of the set-ups the churches provide, where they have three types of living-first of all independent living, then hostel living, and then nursing home care-all together in one area. I believe that as people get older and feel that they need to go into a home, that is the ideal way to do it. Perhaps it is appropriate to say those few words of commendation today while we are discussing this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have a tremendous responsibility to look after the aged in our community. There is no doubt at all that our population is aging, and that presents an enormous challenge for the future. In 1901 only 4 per cent of the population was aged 65 years or more. In 1981 that figure had risen to 14 per cent. The Australian Bureau of Statistics in its most recent series projects that the figure will increase to 16 per cent in the year 2001 and 22 per cent in 2021. Of course, there is a strong relationship between increasing age and the likelihood of admission to a hostel or nursing home. Of the population aged 85 years and over, 36.7 per cent are cared for in residential accommodation, 11.5 per cent in hostels and 25.2 per cent in nursing homes. Figures indicate that there will be a sharp increase in the need to provide care services for aged persons over the next three decades. In particular, there will be a rapid increase from 1991 in most dependent aged groups. Consistent with this trend, expenditure on the aged is projected to rise by more than 50 per cent in real terms between the years 2001 and 2021. </PARA>
<PARA> One fact which will present difficulties is that, because of the slow rate of increase in the number of children being born, the working population cannot be counted on to provide sufficient revenue to cover the increasing public costs of the aged. Even since 1973 the nursing home expenditure increase has been greater than increases in the consumer price index and movements in average weekly earnings. Since 1973 there has been a 278 per cent increase in expenditure per average bed day in hostels, and a 606 per cent increase in nursing homes. International comparisons show that Australia is among the high provision countries, although not the highest. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation has a number of parts. Part I is a preliminary and introductory passage. Part II amends the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act. It affords the Minister discretion to provide up to 100 per cent instead of 80 per cent of capital funding for financially disadvantaged groups. It also increases funding for people receiving hostel care services, personal care services and respite care services in hostels. Parts III and IV amend the National Health Act and the Nursing Homes Assistance Act respectively. Control of the growth of the number of nursing home beds is obtained by allowing the Minister to specify a maximum number of subsidised beds in each State and Territory or in a region of a State or Territory. Hostel care subsidies will rise by 19.3 per cent, the aim being to fund a strategy to restructure improved residential and community care services for aged people through a shift to hostel-based services. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the report of the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes-the Giles report-and the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure-the McLeay report-criticised the Government's administration of nursing homes as being ad hoc and unco-ordinated. Senator Grimes, in his capacity as Minister for Community Services, instigated a review and in April the report of the Nursing Homes and Hostels Review was tabled in the Senate. This report stated that there was too great an emphasis on nursing homes and inadequate support for hostels, and that this imbalance should be corrected. I support the concept of moving away from institutionalised care and encouraging home and community care so as to enable the elderly a more independent style of living. However, I believe that we have to recognise the need to provide more money for, for example, the Blue Nursing Service, Meals on Wheels and community care. I had the opportunity recently to go to the annual meeting of the Brisbane central area of the Blue Nursing Service. That meeting expressed the view that this was something that needed to be looked at. We need to be concerned also with the reduction in the number of nursing home beds. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ND4">Senator BJELKE-PETERSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are trying to make more hostel beds available. All I am saying is that if we are to make more hostel beds available we have to be careful that we do not reduce the opportunity for people who are in need of nursing home care to find a nursing home bed. We have to watch out that we do not make hostels into institutions that provide a type of nursing home care. I find that the people in hostels are fairly mobile and are able to get around; they only need people to look after them, in a caretaking capacity, and to be able to press a bell if they need attention during the night. We have to be careful that we do not put people into hostels who perhaps need care by nursing sisters during the night, which would require the hostels to pay extra wages. We have to look at this. I believe that the provision of respite beds is worth while. I am sure many people who keep their aged or invalid parents at home find that the provision of respite beds for just two or three weeks or even a month is wonderful because it gives them a chance to have a little holiday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I certainly appreciate that the Government is concerned that nursing home benefits have not been utilised properly, but we have to make sure that the best interests of the aged are given priority. The Minister suggested in his speech that perhaps some 25 per cent of placements in nursing homes were inappropriate. I am not sure whether that figure is correct but it is important when dealing with the aged and the sick to err on the side of generosity and compassion. I listened to Senator Giles speaking about old folk who had Alzheimer's disease and dementia. There is certainly a need for extra nursing home beds for people who have such problems. </PARA>
<PARA> One aspect of the Bill concentrates power in the hands of the Minister. I appreciate that there has to be a central governing body, but it is important that there not be such centralised power that the needs of the individual and perhaps isolated communities are ignored or not properly considered. I believe that this will be taken into consideration by the Minister. Queensland, of course, is a highly decentralised State, and demographically different regions have different requirements. A large number of elderly citizens are coming to settle in Queensland each year and that has put a further increase on the demand for nursing homes in the south-east region of Queensland. Actually, I was glad to learn that there will be increases in nursing home benefits. I received a letter from our shadow Minister, Senator Peter Baume, who gave us that information and said that there was certainly a large gap payment that was causing many problems for people in nursing homes. So these benefits have been increased and that, of course, is very good. One thing that I was a little disappointed in, was the fact that in Queensland and Tasmania the amounts are much less than in some of the other States. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the notion of moving away from an ad hoc approach to nursing care. The industry is crying out for a needs-based planning approach. It provides for a change in the existing balance between providing intensive care, through nursing homes, and providing appropriate community services and hostel options. I hope that the Government ensures that the welfare of the frail and the aged is the paramount consideration in this shift of emphasis. As I said earlier, I would hate to see a situation where very sick patients are put into hostel-type accommodation where there is perhaps little or no specialised nursing care for them. It is one thing to streamline the operations of nursing home care in the community, but it is another to do so at the expense of the needs of the frail and aged in the community. However, the Opposition parties support this Bill and commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, as a member of the Government, am pleased to add my support to this piece of legislation. I think the Government needs to be commended for it. I am also pleased to note that the Opposition, in making its contribution to this debate, in large part is supportive of the general aims and principles in this legislation. It was interesting to hear Senator Giles run us through the history of inquiries in the nursing homes area and I think the Government needs to be congratulated. Perhaps one could say the time was ripe. We have had the inquiries and have found any amount of agreement concerning the importance of assessing the needs of the population and setting limits on the maximum number of nursing home beds and so on. Perhaps the time was ripe but I think it should also be noted that the Government, and the Minister for Community Services (Senator Grimes) in particular, had the will as well. We have had a fairly speedy response from the Minister for Community Services not only on the Nursing Homes and Hostels Review but also on this legislation which will amend the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954, the National Health Act 1953 and the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974 and make a number of changes in line with the general principles enshrined in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 the amendments will allow the Commonwealth to make grants to eligible organisations to meet the capital costs of homes for aged or disabled people. In particular, it will allow the Commonwealth to provide up to 100 per cent of funding for disadvantaged groups. I think this is very important where, for example, such groups may not be able to find or raise funds to match Commonwealth subsidies. So the Commonwealth, aware of the needs of such groups of people, has provided the option that 100 per cent of the funding of capital costs can be provided by it. Under this Act there has also been an increase in personal care subsidies. These figures will actually increase from $7.80 per day to $8.40 per day from 22 October 1986 and there will be a further increase to $11 per day from 6 May 1987-a total sum of $77 per week, which is a considerable amount in terms of the provision of personal care subsidies. There are other provisions in this legislation for payment to people living in hostels and I will not spell out all the details. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes or amendments to the National Health Act 1953 and the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974 will allow the Government to establish growth control arrangements over the approval in principle and the approval mechanisms for new nursing homes and new beds in existing nursing homes. I commend Senator Peter Baume for making it absolutely clear that the Opposition understands that there is not to be a decrease in nursing home beds. I simply reiterate that because Senator Bjelke-Petersen's words could have led to a misunderstanding. There is not to be a decrease in nursing home beds; there is to be a control in the rate of growth in new nursing home beds. As Senator Giles spelt out, that is entirely consistent with the thrust of the three reports that she mentioned in this area. Again Senator Baume was quite clear on that. His understanding, which is my understanding and that of the Government, is that there will be no reduction in nursing home beds. But under these amendments the Government will have the ability to set maximums on ordinary beds and special needs beds both in the States and in the regions. This will provide a cost saving over time and those savings will be redistributed to the cost increases under the hostel program. In fact, essentially the amendments have come out as revenue neutral. But I think it is terribly important to say, once again, that there will not be a reduction in nursing home beds; there will be a reduction in the growth rate of nursing home beds. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as setting maximums for regions and special needs, the proposals under these amendments will allow a more rational distribution of nursing home beds-again I take up the points raised by my colleague Senator Giles and some of the Opposition speakers-to meet the changes in demography and the changes in the circumstances of communities so that we are not left with a surplus of nursing home beds where there are no people but have the flexibility to adjust the provision of nursing home beds to those areas where people have a need for them. In short, there is an emphasis on trying to provide the nursing home beds as near as possible to where the people who need them live and that is consistent with the other general thrusts of this legislation which I will come to in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 allow for an increase in capital grants. That cost is assessed to be $0.5m in 1986-87 rising to $2.8m in 1987-88. As well, the increases in subsidy levels and the introduction of automatic indexation mean a cost of $5.6m in 1986-87 rising to $26.5m in 1987-88. Under the amendments to the National Health Act 1953 and the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974 the introduction of growth controls in the nursing home area will provide savings of $4m in 1986-87 and $27.7m in 1987-88. If we put those costs and savings against each other we see that the legislation will mean that the net financial impact is more or less financially neutral. </PARA>
<PARA> It will certainly not be neutral in terms of its effect on the community. I wanted to make some general points and pick up Senator Baume's point on the philosophy of this legislation. The Opposition has said it welcomes this. As the reports have stated and as Senator Giles has spelt out, the Government is very concerned to provide optimal care for both our aged and our disabled people. It is important to realise that not all disabled people are necessarily aged. It is important to recognise that a number of very young people have disabilities which require very extensive and continual nursing care. While an emphasis is currently moving towards rehabilitation of all disabled people at all ages, not all disabled people are old. I think we have to recognise that and remember it. In the inquiry of the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes, of which I was a member, it became clear that there was quite a lot of difficulty and dissatisfaction for young disabled people when the only provision of care available for them was in an elderly persons' nursing home. There was just not sufficient appropriate company, apart from anything else. The service of nursing care may have been adequate, and very often it was, but the community surround for those young people was insufficient. The recommendations in the report urged the separation of young disabled people from the more aged community. I understand that the process of encouraging young disabled people out of aged care provisions and into the community, rather than even to their own nursing home, but as much as possible toward independent living or assisted living in the community, is well under way. The Minister for Community Services (Senator Grimes) is very committed to encouraging that to happen as much as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that needs to be stressed is that many people who are sufferers of Alzheimer's disease are not elderly. One of the shocking statistics is that people in their 40s can show early signs of the onset of Alzheimer's disease. I think we have to take a little care, when we talk about legislation in this area, to appreciate that we are talking about a population that is much wider than frail aged people, who may be 75 or 85 years of age. A number of the people needing nursing home care or hostel accommodation are much younger than the aged population to which I have just referred. We have to be careful about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point which Senator Giles raised and which I think needs to be considered in this area too is that there is a real complexity in providing services for aged or disabled people. For instance, people suffering from senility or Alzheimer's disease-a distinction I draw between those two categories of people-are not in need of hour by hour nursing care. Very often these people are more than able to be up and about, to feed themselves, to do their laundry and in all sorts of ways to look after their own personal needs. Their principal problem is that they need to be restrained. It is hard to know what their diagnostic difficulty is, but they are certainly not able to keep themselves in one place; they wander and they may not be aware of where they are in the world. They may not know their address and they may not remember where they have come from or how they got there. Very often the care they need is some kind of constraint on where they go; that is, they need to have a wall around the perimeter of the place in which they are living and, as Senator Giles said, locks on doors, which is distressing for us. In some ways, it is more distressing for us than for the people who are confined. The point that needs to be made though is that their principal need is for constraint of that sort, not hour by hour nursing care. Very often these people are not in need of the high intensity nursing care that some of the totally disabled and fully bed-ridden people need. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to another point touched on by Senator Giles: How do we assess the needs of care? It is extraordinarily difficult. Under the home and community care provisions legislation some effort has been made towards addressing that matter by way of assessment teams and making sure that people's needs for care are appropriately matched to the provision of care, if possible. Even within a nursing home or hostel a considerable range of services are needed. For example, people may be incontinent-to pick up the case mentioned by Senator Powell-but for all other reasons perfectly able to manage by themselves. Again, such people do not need high intensity nursing care but may in fact have come to a stage when they cannot manage in their own home or their relatives cannot manage with them at home. So the provision of nursing care for them is very different from that for a totally bed-ridden person who may have had a stroke, some sort of cerebral accident, or a motor car accident. I think that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume raised the point that it is important to have the provisions of amendments open to parliamentary scrutiny and not simply available to the Minister to change by way of gazettal. I spent some time with the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills this morning going through those points and taking note of the Minister's response. I understand that the Minister will address those points at the end of the second reading debate. However, I know from my own experience that, while there are very clearly defined regulations, they can be a constraint on the optimal care and provision of care for people. It is not too long ago-and I am sure Senator Walters will recognise this-when regulations required that for people to be eligible for nursing home benefits they had to be bed-ridden. What happened in nursing homes was that people were encouraged to be bed-ridden. They were kept in bed; they were not encouraged towards programs of rehabilitation and were not encouraged to be up and about or to do for themselves at all. Under the regulations, they would not have been eligible for a subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a tension between the needs of legislation and regulations, or proposed changes under that legislation, to be subject to proper regard or scrutiny by Parliament but at the same time to be flexible enough to provide for optimal provision of care for patients. I know that those two matters are in a bit of tension in this legislation. I do not think that I should come down on one side or the other, but in the area that we are talking about, and from my own experience, I have found it very distressing to see regulations leading to less than proper provision of care for elderly or disabled people. I am hopeful that whatever solution may need to be found, if there is the need for a solution or further discussion between the Opposition about this sort of matter, as much flexibility is allowed to the Minister and to the legislation to enable flexibility at the level of provision of care so that the matron in charge, the doctor prescribing instructions or the family who want things to happen can be clear that they will not lose subsidies and that there will not be constraints on them providing optimal provisions for the care of such people in nursing homes in particular but also, to some extent, in hostels. I think that is really very important. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very encouraging to see the changes in the emphasis of care in nursing homes over the last five years or so, perhaps even a little longer, going to such things as the rehabilitation of elderly people. In times past, if an elderly person was admitted to a nursing home, quite clearly there was a feeling of `That is it. We now give up and from Sunday to Sunday we visit and talk to the elderly person'. That is just not the emphasis any more. In fact, both public and private nursing homes are providing rehabilitation programs matched to the needs of the people so that a number of elderly people, who may be admitted for short term surgery or for a stay in a nursing home subsequent to a stroke, are in fact able to return to independent living. This is to be welcomed and is very heartening. People are not being written off once they get into a nursing home. This legislation very much endorses that sort of principle because it goes to flexible provision of where nursing home beds and hostel beds are and encouragement to support the principle of helping people to live independently where they prefer to live, which is very often where they have been living up to this point. </PARA>
<PARA> Encouragement of independent living is important. As people become older and more frail some very simple things are beyond their capacity. For example, as was mentioned by Senator Powell, the changing of a light bulb is very difficult for a person with arthritis or a frail, older person, but the simple provision of a new light bulb means that such a person can continue to live very adequately in his or her own home. The support to this legislation which goes under the home and community care provisions and through a number of initiatives from various local governments is to be very much welcomed and encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> The thrust of the legislation is along the lines that we want to help people to live independently and we want to help them to live where they prefer to live, which is usually at home. Importantly, we have to help families of a relative of an older or disabled person to manage with such a person at home. That goes to two points. One is the provision of sufficient community services. For example, ramps might be necessary at home to help somebody with a wheelchair; there may be a need to reconstruct access to a house for cars and so on, or access within a house; there may be a need, too, to provide some kind of respite for such an aged or handicapped person in a hostel. Provisions are made under the amendments in this Bill to allow that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important that we support the relatives. I am particularly concerned about that because much of the care in this area has been provided in the past by relatives-very often women-in the home. The quite massive contribution that women have made in caring for elderly or disabled people in their families over time has to be acknowledged. It is very important that we do not take away opportunities for people to continue to be generous in that way. A lot of people still prefer to do so. I guess other honourable senators could name as well as I could many people who are willing to make that kind of commitment to their relatives. It is very good that this legislation endorses that and provides for respite if it is necessary so that people can continue as much as possible to support their relatives at home, if that is the preference within the family. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important to appreciate that under the hostel provisions we have a second tier almost-we know that certain people now need some kind of generalised supervision or care but are fairly much able to live independently within those broader constraints. For example, it may be difficult for somebody to clean leaves out of gutters or maintain a household, but once the outside-the walls and the roof-and the payment of rent and so on are looked after a person within such hostel accommodation is able to live perfectly adequately quite independently. I am delighted that the legislation endorses and enshrines that kind of encouragement to people in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the nursing home bed provision will continue. The points have been quite well made that there is a need for nursing home beds in this community, and that need will continue. Hopefully we can remove from nursing home beds those people who are most inappropriately placed there. Indeed, I think it was the report of the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes that found that something like 25 per cent of people could be assessed as being inappropriately placed in nursing home beds. If those beds are freed up by a more appropriate placement of people in hostel accommodation or even, with rehabilitation and encouragement, by returning people home to independent living, while our need for nursing home beds will continue it will do so at a slower rate. </PARA>
<PARA> When I became a member of the Senate I joined the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes and had the benefit of the information that was provided to it in submissions and evidence that was sought by that inquiry. It fitted very well with the work that I had been doing prior to coming to the Senate. I am delighted to see that work being fulfilled, at least in part. I think the disability legislation and the home and community care legislation are to be bracketed with this legislation. I am delighted that we have this legislation in place to show clearly the Government's commitment to the recommendations of the Committee following its investigations in that area of nursing homes and hostels. I commend the Government for introducing this legislation. </PARA>

It is very pleasing that the Opposition is in full agreement with the aim of that legislation, which is to increase the variety of services to the aged in the area of residential accommodation and community services. Like Senator Crowley, I was a member of one of the committees mentioned by the Minister for Community Services (Senator Grimes) in his second reading speech, the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes. We both had quite an opportunity to go around the country and become very aware of the problems faced by Australian citizens as they get older. However we did not need to go around Australia to know-we knew it from our own experiences-that the aged want to stay at home as long as they possibly can. We have all seen these problems as our relatives have grown old. We all know the traumas of an elderly aunt or elderly parents having to go into a nursing home. Considerable traumas are associated with that. As Senator Crowley said so rightly, previously it was a case of `Once I go into a nursing home that is it'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we get older our capability of looking after ourselves gradually deteriorates. It does not usually happen as a result of a grave illness; it happens over a number of years. We get to the stage at which we are unable to look after our homes properly. This has already been referred to. We become unable to get out of the bath with any assurance. In my early days here, when I was boarding with an elderly woman in Barton, she used to say: `I can always have a bath when you are up here in Canberra because I know that at least you are coming home at night and if I cannot get out you will be there to pull me out'. These are the worries associated with people getting old. Then it goes from not being able to look after one's home and garden to not being able to look after oneself-one's hygiene, cooking and general care-and the worries that are attached to that. </PARA>
<PARA> As we travelled around we were told by many of the elderly that they would like an alarm system so that if they were to fall off a stool while trying, for instance, to replace a light bulb in the kitchen they could make sure that someone would know that they had fallen, so that they would not be lying there overnight or perhaps for days. At the moment there is some community care, but we have not really scratched the surface. The most common form of community care at the moment is meals on wheels. I, too, have served on meals on wheels. When one works in the community taking around the hot meal for the day the elderly person to whom one takes it does not want just that meal; he or she very desperately needs someone to whom to chat. I used to find it very difficult just to deliver that meal and walk out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They wanted to communicate, as Senator Gietzelt says. There is the need for communication. The person delivering meals on wheels is probably the only person to go into their homes for the whole of the day. The need to communicate is really very great. Such people will also ask one to do little jobs for them, such as to post a letter-little things that they cannot do themselves. That need for communication and for someone to enter their homes once a day is very, very important to them. It depends on the State, and on the local government usually, how much assistance in the home is really available to them. Some of the States and local governments have moved in these areas to a considerable extent. Some of the local governments provide quite a degree of home assistance to the elderly; others have not been able to move in that area at all.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, Mr President, I have only seen the Press reports. I have not seen the House of Representatives Expenditure Committee report. But, to anybody who has looked seriously at taxation policy at all, it is very clear that two things must be done in order to eliminate tax evasion-or to go very close to eliminating it. First, we have to have an effective identity card system; in other words, the Australia Card, which the Opposition is committed to opposing. Of course, in light of the Opposition's being pushed around by the New Right, as it is, it is not surprising that it is opposing it. The second requirement is a credible threat of retrospective legislation. If any further evidence was required of the need for that, I think it was disclosed on the front page of the Melbourne Age a couple of weeks ago in an article written by Mr McCrann. Mr McCrann, at least in matters where his political bias does not cloud his judgment, is, I think, a very reliable journalist about facts such as that. Mr McCrann alleged that there has been a trans-Tasman tax swindle under which companies with interests in both countries have claimed in both countries tax deductions on interest paid. If that is correct-the facts are being checked out, I understand-it demonstrates that Part IVa, which Mr Howard boasts of having introduced, is not adequate to eliminate fraud against Commonwealth revenue and the only way to really effectively eliminate that sort of fraud is a credible threat of retrospective legislation. In other words, the Opposition claims to be committed to stamping out tax evasion, but everything it actually does, in the way of votes in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, has the effect of protecting tax evaders.</PARA></TALK.START>

Just fortuitously, I have here today the infamous telephone book-the John Howard record, as Treasurer-which Mr Howard was forced to table in 1982 and which contains, I think, a total of some 28 entreaties from the Taxation Commissioner to the then Treasurer to do something about enforcing the payment of tax by certain manipulative and privileged groups in the country. We all know what his response to that was. He sat on his hands for five years while the corporate tax base was eroded to the point where it was in danger of disappearing altogether.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TE4">Senator BLACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Finance as Minister representing the Treasurer. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article on the front page of this morning's Australian Financial Review outlining the early history of Elders IXL and, in particular, the roles of Liberal Party Treasurer, John Elliott, and three associates in founding that corporation? Does the article say that the process of building up Elders IXL began with a $2 company, Akma Pty Ltd, that the four individuals featured in the article each began with assets of between a few hundred dollars and $5,000, and that each is now variously estimated to be worth between $8m and $100m? Is their success story a positive indicator of the opportunities available for investment in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see that story. Indeed, I do find it very hard to understand just where Mr Elliott is and why. The only way I think that I have been able to reconcile the various conflicting statements by Mr Elliott-or at least, the conflicts between the statements he makes and the things he does-is by recognising that sometimes he is acting for himself and sometimes he is a mouthpiece for the Liberal Party of Australia. As I said, I have seen that report, and it just adds to the confusion about Mr Elliott. For example, when he said that there was no incentive to invest in Australia, I thought initially it might just have been that too much Fosters was responsible for that. But if he really believed that, of course, this begs the question of why he spent hundreds of millions of dollars of Elders IXL shares buying himself a seat on the BHP board. He cannot have it both ways. If there is no incentive to invest in Australia-if he really believes that-he should be charged with breach of duty as a company director for using Elders IXL shares to buy himself a seat on the BHP board in the way that he did a while ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suspect that Mr Elliott is pretty dirty on the Government because he will no longer be able to get away with the sort of de facto embezzlement he pulled in the Henry Jones takeover, which was written about by Terry McCrann in the Age on 15 April this year. McCrann wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> Shortly before Elders Smith unveiled its bid for Henry Jones, the leading executives in Henry Jones outlayed $19,000 in taking up one cent paid shares under an executive incentive scheme. The Elders Smith offer delivered a clear tax free profit of $4.16m to those executives. Mr Elliott himself cleared $657,000 on a $3,000 outlay.</PARA>
<PARA>He will no longer be able to pick up tax free capital gains of that magnitude. Whether there is incentive to invest in Australia or not, one thing there certainly is incentive to do is to become a director of Elders IXL. It is noted in today's Adelaide Advertiser that the directors have just magnanimously increased by 50 per cent, from $400,000 to $600,000, the remuneration that they may receive as directors.</PARA>

Amounts for certain projects were carried forward in successive years, so another heavy qualification has to be put on that figure. In addition, there was an Australian supplier which was unable to deliver equipment to schedule. Despite this failure, there was pressure to persist with the contract. Those problems with the supplier meant that the allocation could not be spent in the year. The two major areas of underspending are the prescribed payments system and the replacement data entry system. The data entry system money has now been spent and the system installed, but the PPS has not yet been concluded.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hazardous waste management within Australia, including siting and regulation of hazardous waste disposal facilities, is primarily the responsibility of State and Territory governments. Responsibilities of the Commonwealth Government in this field relate par- ticularly to international aspects-for example, imports and exports of hazardous wastes-and the encouragement and facilitation of a national approach to waste management where appropriate. There is no facility in Australia capable of destroying highly stable organochlorine waste materials and other intractable wastes. Incineration of these wastes in a specialised incinerator capable of operation at a very high temperature is the only proven, environmentally acceptable means available for their disposal. Substantial quantities of organochlorine wastes are being stockpiled in Australia pending availability of facilities for their destruction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government, in common with State governments, supports the objective of establishing a high temperature incinerator in Australia. However, any facility proposed would need to be constructed and operated according to stringent environmental conditions so as to avoid environmental contamination. Such plants operate in Europe and North America in a fashion which does not cause damage to the environment or the health of the community. The Government, on behalf of the Australian Environment Council, has sponsored national consultations which have the specific objective of addressing possible public concern surrounding establishment of a high temperature incinerator in Australia. I am advised that the Northern Territory is proceeding with feasibility and environmental impact studies in relation to the proposal for an incinerator near Tennant Creek. Dealings with the local community and arrangements for commercial management of the proposed project are the responsibility of the Northern Territory Government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Specifically on that question, I have no idea what hospitals charge and what the likely assessed value of board will be. Subject to some concessions and exemptions which were announced a couple of weeks ago and before, the general principle which applies to fringe benefits taxation is that where there is an employer-employee relationship and the employee receives benefits in kind, on which a monetary value can be placed, then the employer will be liable to pay the tax on those fringe benefits. I can only assume that the Opposition believes that income in kind can be substituted for wages and salaries and that nothing should be done about that. That is what Mr Howard says publicly-that there should be no tax on fringe benefits and that the fringe benefits tax should be abolished lock, stock and barrel. Mr Sinclair, of course, says that this taxation should be picked up under section 26 (e) and meanwhile Mr Howard, as part of the secret tax agenda for the Liberal Party, has his own beavers working away on legislation for his particular variant of the fringe benefits tax. That has been going on for some months. Publicly Mr Howard says that there should be no tax on fringe benefits and that this tax should be abolished lock, stock and barrel. If I may say so, that attitude is consistent with the view that he adopted when he was Treasurer. I have a document-it is part of the telephone book of documents I have with me-which shows that when the Commissioner of Taxation early in 1978 replied to some earlier correspondence, he noted that the Government of the day had taken a decision not to tax fringe benefits. At least that much is consistent about Mr Howard. When he was Treasurer he took a decision that fringe benefits should not be taxed and he is now saying publicly that they should not be taxed. He is consistent up to that point. But of course with his secret agenda he has a group of people beavering away to produce his variant of the taxation of fringe benefits. Should he ever become Prime Minister-that is highly unlikely; he is unlikely to survive another six months as leader of the Liberal Party, let alone become Prime Minister-he will follow the secret tax agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the inquiry into the Australian War Memorial began a couple of months ago, there have been a number of obviously contrived letters to the newspapers suggesting that there was some sort of hidden agenda in respect of the problems of administration at the War Memorial. There is absolutely no substance in the allegations that were made by the shadow Minister or, for that matter, by the honourable member for the Northern Territory in the adjournment debate last evening and by other such persons who have written letters suggesting that an attempt is being made by the Government, the Minister or historians at the War Memorial to change the character and nature of that Memorial. Never at any time have I sought to change the direction or the policy of the War Memorial. In discussions with members of the Council of the Australian War Memorial, with staff members or with any other person associated with the War Memorial, I have never sought to change the functions of or reasons for the Australian War Memorial Act or the structures or responsibilities that flowed from that Act. The Government is satisfied that the Australian War Memorial's policies reflect the aspirations of that Memorial-that is that they reflect Australia's involvement in past conflicts and commemorate those who served and died in those conflicts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would be totally wrong for government, Ministers or any other persons to find themselves in the position of Mr Nakasone, the Prime Minister of Japan, whose Minister for Education sought to distort the historical involvement of the Japanese in the invasion of China in the late 1920s and the 1930s. Therefore, any suggestion that any person would seek to distort the historical position of Australia's involvement in past conflicts would be obviously laughable and completely unacceptable, not only to the Government but, I would hope, to every member of the Parliament. Consequently, any suggestions made by so-called responsible people in the Opposition that there is some sort of hidden agenda will be refuted by me and the Government because the conflicts which exist over the Australian War Memorial are about administration and not about policy directions.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, within the community there are different concepts about how history can be recorded. For example, I have received complaints from the Vietnam Veterans' Association that the Memorial's gallery on Australia's involvement in Vietnam does not correctly reflect the total position with respect to the Vietnam War. That is a view that that organisation holds and obviously people will hold different views about the way in which the Council accepts its responsibilities. However, I repudiate completely any suggestion that I have at any time entertained any thoughts of changing the basic thrust and responsibilities on which the Australian War Memorial Council carries out its functions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not able to follow all of the figures that Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle gave but I think there was an apparent inconsistency between them. If one takes estimates from particular times, there is an apparent inconsistency. The reason for that is that the original estimates that were made were subsequently revised. There has been at least one revision since the Budget figures were prepared. The most recent estimates-I will check this with the Treasurer-are that for a full year the fringe benefits tax will yield $520m and the substantiation requirements will add $180m, making $700m in total, which I think was one of the figures that Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle gave. That is the most recent estimate but there have been revisions from time to time, which of course is not at all unusual, as more knowledge and information come to hand. That accounts for what I think were apparent inconsistencies in the figures that Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle cited. I do not know whether there was another purpose to the question, to show that there is something wrong with collecting more revenue. To the extent that revenue estimates have been revised upwards, and if that revision is more accurate than the earlier estimates, that of course demonstrates that there was an even greater need for the fringe benefits tax than had previously been believed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whether the propositions advanced by Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen and miscellaneous acolytes around the place, such as Andrew Hay, might amount to the offence of treason under section 24 of the Crimes Act, which relates to levying war against the Commonwealth, would be a matter for the proper authorities. All I can really say is that the issue need not concern us unduly because, quite apart from the legal position of such an army, there must be quite serious doubts about the ability of extremists such as Mr Hay to muster troops and to hold together any kind of united force. I remind the Senate that last month Mr Hay went on a very expensive public campaign against the fringe benefits tax yet managed to attract only an estimated 80 people to an extraordinarily heavily publicised anti-tax rally in Hobart, and even fewer people as a proportion of the population in other capital cities-hardly a popular uprising. Earlier this year he was not able even to maintain unity among his senior officers, as was evidenced by the angry departure from the Australian Federation of Employers of Mr John Leard, who I see has now gone off to mount a pop-gun revolution of his own.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Federal Government is clearly able and willing by all available means to meet this and any other half-baked insurgency that might emanate from the north. As to the advice I am asked to give to the Premier, to Mr Hay and to the gaggle of vulgar populists such as Katharine West who follow their banner, I simply advise them to stop trying to jump on to a right wing authoritarian band wagon of the kind that they are engaged in.

As all honourable senators know, this is exactly what the Government has done with the Data Protection Agency which will be established under the Australia Card Bill and the Privacy Bill which will be enacted in tandem with it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As for the latter part of Senator Crowley's question, I would find it difficult to understand how Mr Moran could be qualified to speak for the poor and disadvantaged in the community. He is, in fact, one of Australia's most astute and successful nursing home entrepreneurs; of that there is no question. The fact that he could afford to pay about $16,000 or $18,000 for a full page advertisement in a newspaper in that way demonstrates that. I also draw attention to the fact that a similar advertisement was put in by Mr Moran, where he has sponsored a portrait prize in this country, the prize money for which is $190,000, which is, I understand, the highest amount of money for a portrait prize in the world. I am not objecting to these activities. They certainly demonstrate his skill as an entrepreneur. But they also demonstrate, first, that he, as the proprietor of 20-plus nursing homes and the agent running more than that number, is not doing too badly if he can afford that sort of money for that kind of art prize and those sorts of advertisements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that a large proportion of Mr Moran's income comes from the public purse. The nursing home benefits which are paid to his nursing homes and the ones that he operates for others provide him with considerable income and considerable wealth. He is also very familiar with the mechanisms for administrative review of the nursing homes legislation as it exists at present. For many years he has consistently appealed against decisions of various Ministers. I note that an appeal has been lodged over one decision of this Government, which will involve a full four weeks of the time of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which will involve considerable public funds in providing legal aid for the community organisation being appealed against. In fact, I know that sometimes I and some Ministers of previous governments have wondered who administers the nursing homes legislation-the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Federal Court, Mr Moran, or the Minister and the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> What we have been trying to do is to introduce legislation, after considerable consultation with non-government organisations, government organisations, private organisations and the representatives of the aged people in this community, and this legislation is the result of reviews that have been conducted for the last 10 years, and the result of a nursing homes and hostels review by this Government, which has been considerably discussed throughout the community in the last two years, both before the report came out and since then. To suggest, as he suggests in the advertisement, that this legislation is being rushed through the Parliament without consultation is extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA> I have some sympathy for Mr Moran, I suppose, because politicians sometimes find themselves in a similar situation. He has spent some $16,000 or $18,000, maybe more, putting this advertisement in the paper. One journalist in the whole country has bothered to ask me about it. As far as I am concerned, no newspaper carried any comment on it. He must be disappointed that such considerable expenditure has created so little interest in the media generally. I admire him for his astuteness as an entrepreneur, I admire him for his capacity to achieve considerable wealth as a result of his activities in the nursing home profession, and I admire him for spending some of that money on the arts; but I do not admire his attempts to influence the Parliament in such a crude way. I wish that he would spend more time discussing these matters both with my Department and in fact with me, and I dare say with the Opposition, rather than trying to address this Parliament through expensive full page advertisements which have little effect.</PARA>

Additionally, the New South Wales Minister has been asked to ensure that the New South Wales representative on the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers working group on international agreements relating to migratory and wetlands birds keeps the working group fully informed on actions being taken to protect the Towra Point nature reserve.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 10-year effect of the Opposition's decision to oppose the introduction of the Australia Card is that tax evaders and those indulging in welfare frauds will rob-I use that word advisedly-their fellow citizens of about $4 1/2 billion. That is what is likely to happen over a 10-year period because of the actions of the Opposition, with the support of the Australian Democrats. As I said earlier in Question Time, that decision by the Opposition is entirely consistent with Mr Howard's record in government, when he allowed massive evasion of the taxation system and refused to take any really effective deterrent action against such evasion until the publication of the McCabe-Lafranchi and Costigan reports put him in the position where it was politically untenable for him to do anything else. We know, of course, that there are many pressures on Mr Howard to behave in the way he has done, and one significant pressure comes from the New Right, or at least from some of its members, chief among whom I suppose is Andrew Hay, former private secretary to another Liberal Party Treasurer, Sir Phillip Lynch. I have in this `telephone book' a minute from the Commissioner of Taxation dated 20 July 1977 in which the Commissioner was responding to a number of alleged tax evasion schemes which had been earlier forwarded to him. On one, a share trading scheme, the Commissioner outlined the ways in which it was possible that such a share trading tax evasion scheme could work, and then said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, this kind of scheme would then be open to attack under the gift duty law.</PARA>
<PARA>Gift duty was then promptly abolished. So to the extent that the gift duty law was a deterrent to the use of that tax evasion scheme, that tax evasion was then facilitated by the Fraser Government abolishing gift duty. Presumably it then became open slather. That was at the time Andrew Hay was the principal private secretary to the Treasurer, Sir Phillip Lynch, and I presume was facilitating tax evasion in that capacity, as he continues to do. It ought to be noted that I have received some complaints from Lady Lynch, and indeed a report was published in the Melbourne Herald, I think in September, in which Lady Lynch said effectively that Mr Hay had not helped to organise the Stumpy Gully affair-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true, as Senator Elstob suggested, that the report into the Australian War Memorial makes a number of serious findings in relation to the involvement of the Director in the transfer of bank accounts from the Commonwealth Bank to the Westpac Banking Corporation. The report finds that he reacted contrary to the strong advice given to him by a senior officer of the Australian War Memorial and that he gave false information both to the Executive Committee of the Australian War Memorial Council as well as to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment and the Parliament concerning the way in which the Australian War Memorial administration had canvassed a number of banks before transferring the account from the Commonwealth Bank to Westpac. If this were not so serious the activities of the Director in this matter would be almost laughable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Director was first asked by the investigator, Mr Jones, to explain what discussions had taken place with different bankers about transferring the account he nominated the branches of four banks and named four bank managers as having been contacted. Mr Jones's inquiries revealed that the banks concerned knew nothing about the matter. When Mr Jones again took this matter up with the Director he acknowledged that he had misled Mr Jones but said that he had not intended to imply that he had talked to the bank managers he had nominated. Rather, the Director claimed that he had visited each bank deliberately as a private individual and discussed their services with the counter staff. This explanation almost defies belief and indicates that, whenever faced with a difficult situation, the Director prevaricates or treats the truth rather carelessly. Naturally, Mr Jones, to use his words, found that the reply of the Director compounded the problem as far as the transfer of that bank account was concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> If the Director is to be believed the counter staff of banks in Canberra need to be specifically alert the next time a potential customer, who looks as though he represents a statutory authority with an account of some millions of dollars, leans confidentially across the counter and asks in a whisper: `What are you offering?'. It seems to me that they would be within their rights if they believed that the person was from the Australian War Memorial.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance would be one of the most important to be discussed because it is time to face the fact that wage and salary earners with family responsibilities have suffered discrimination, at least over the last 10 years. The reason that I have put this matter forward today is that I know that discussions are taking place within Government circles, trade union circles and employer circles about the attitude they are about to take on the next national wage case. This is a plea to acknowledge that discrimination against wage and salary earners at all levels of Federal and State awards has occurred, is continuing to occur and is getting worse. It is a plea to understand why this discrimination has occurred; it is a plea to recognise the damaging consequences of this discrimination; and, most importantly, it is a plea to redress this discrimination. Unless this discrimination is redressed, the Parliament and, more particularly the labour movement, the Government, and the trade union movement, will lose credibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What are the facts? By comparison with others in the work force the net disposable income of male and female workers with family responsibilities under all Federal and State awards has fallen substantially. Not only has it fallen substantially but also these families have been saddled with an unduly greater share of the taxation burden. As an example of what I am saying let me take a family with four children living on average earnings. The standard of living of that family has dropped by 11 per cent over the last 10 years and will fall a further one per cent by June next year, even allowing for the much trumpeted tax cuts. Any worker with family responsibilities who thinks the tax cuts will redress the situation has another think coming. In fact, given the tax cuts, the purchasing power of that family, as described, next financial year will be $1,230 less than the purchasing power of the same sized family in 1976. On the other hand, the purchasing power of a couple with no children and a combined income of one and a half times average weekly earnings will be $910 more than for the same unit in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> We must ask ourselves: Why are we not acknowledging this? We must surely acknowledge that the discrimination has occurred. Pointers to this acknowledgment have been tabled in the Parliament. The most recent one was tabled yesterday, but the one to which I wish to refer is the Social Security Review, Issues Paper No. 1, `Income Support for Families with Children'. That was forwarded to Parliament three weeks ago. On page 6 of that document the review committee says:</PARA>
<PARA> Payments to families with children in Australia developed as an adjunct to wages policy, recognising that wages do not take account of family responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> National wage decisions in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in 1974 and 1977 determined that wage fixation should no longer consider the issue of ``family needs'' which had been an integral part of the Australian concept of the basic wage. </PARA>
<PARA>As I well remember, this question was canvassed during discussions on the total wage. It is now 19 years since the total wage was introduced. Now is the appropriate time to consider what has happened, specifically since 1974, when the decision about the minimum wage was taken. In that decision in 1974 the Full Bench of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has pointed out in the past that it is an industrial arbitration tribunal, not a social welfare agency. We believe that the care of family needs is principally a task for governments. For the reasons mentioned we have decided that the family component should be discarded from the minimum wage concept . . . </PARA>
<PARA>From that time at least formally, and before that time in effect, the family factor has been excluded from consideration of wages by industrial tribunals. I might point out that it is only in the last 20 years, and particularly since the introduction of the total wage in 1967 and that decision on the minimum wage in 1974, that the family factor has ceased formally to be taken into account by industrial tribunals in considering wages policies advocated by unions. Institutionalised union advocacy on behalf of the family wage earner has thereby been lost, and the fate of the worker with family responsibilities has been left to the vagaries of politics. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened in those vagaries of politics? As the Social Security Review mentioned, since 1976, when the tax rebates for children were taken away from taxpayers and were cashed into a family allowance system, all families have experienced a decline in their disposable incomes relative to individuals and couples without children. I refer to page 10 of the review. Additionally, on page 56, the review says that the taxation burden has shifted towards families with children. This has resulted in families bearing a greater share of the tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to that Government document because, in telling us that we are in a crisis situation and that the standard of living of every Australian cannot be expected to increase but can be expected to decline, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that that burden must be shared equitably. The point of this matter of public importance is that the burden has not been shared equitably, is not being shared equitably and, if present policies are to continue, will not be shared equitably-quite the reverse. One must ask oneself also: Why has this discrimination occurred? Particularly where we have a Federal government which ought to have regard to its traditional family supporters, why are its present policies acting against that traditional support? It is clear to me that the advice that it has been getting from the largely two-income aristocracy of Canberra is in effect lobbying for policies which discriminate against workers with family responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy, might I say, is playing into the hands of the New Right, the new establishment, which seeks to pursue policies which will ensure an oversupply of labour. Let me prove that point. In the Financial Australian of 23 October 1986, in the report of an interview between Rowena Stretton and a self-styled member of the new establishment, Darrel Drieberg, it is stated that he is Managing Director of the recently floated Trans Equity Ltd. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> He is rich, entrepreneurial and tough-but likeable. </PARA>
<PARA> At 37, he is divorced and earns an undisclosed sum well above $100,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> He talks about ``the youngsters'' in the business community flexing their muscle and promotes the ideal of ``being a high net worth individual''. </PARA>
<PARA> If he was in political control of Australia he would maintain a high level of unemployment as an economic weapon-``it's always nice to have a surplus of just about everything''. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> ``I don't get hooked up in the inequities. I want what you might call a dog-eat-dog world with degrees of excellence and efficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Attitudes are changing. There's a mental revolution. It's survival of the fittest. People say the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer and society will break down . . . but society will never break down.''</PARA>

I mention particularly the Office of the Status of Women because Senator Susan Ryan is in the chamber. I do this in all seriousness. I believe the proposal that has been put forward by the Office of the Status of Women, as indicated by the Director of that Office, concerning the need to ensure that 85 per cent of married women are in the work force is one which should concern the Government. It flies in the face of what was said by the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, in his John Curtin Memorial Lecture in Perth in September 1983. Bob Hawke said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The plain fact is that no government in Australia will now, or in the foreseeable future, solve the problem of unemployment solely through the available methods of increasing the supply of jobs. At least equal attention must be paid to the question of reducing the demand for jobs by helping to provide socially constructive alternatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But the plain fact is that it is naturally women who seek to achieve that goal, and it is unfortunate that the advice that has been given to the Government in respect of these matters is coming from people who have priorities which are obviously not the Prime Minister's. We must not only understand why it has occurred; we must recognise its damaging consequences. Recently a survey was done on unemployment, and that survey showed that, whilst the official statistics for unemployment are dramatically high, there is a great deal of hidden unemployment. In other words, there are people who seek to be employed in the paid work force but who have no show of getting into the paid work force now or in the foreseeable future. Many of those persons, of course, have family responsibilities and are from families with only one income. The type of family policy being pursued condemns those people to a very sub-standard standard of living.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government might say that it has developed the policy of the family income supplement. Let me say to the Government that the policies it has been pursuing have resulted in the dignity of both male and female workers with family responsibilities being affronted and more and more families being forced into the poverty trap of having to rely on the family income supplement welfare scheme, with no incentive to get out of it. I should like to incorporate in Hansard three tables which have been prepared for me by the Parliamentary Library. The first one is entitled `Effective Marginal Tax Rate on 6 Hours of Regularly Worked Overtime for Person with Dependent Spouse and 4 Children on Average Minimum Award Wage'. This worker's overtime earnings are $69.32, of which $55.02 is taken by an effective marginal tax rate of 80%. That is an absolutely devastating figure. I do not have time to go through the other two, but they are entitled `Tax Payable and Disposable Income, Family with Four Children' and `Disposable Income and Tax Payable', comparing the family with four children and the couple with no children. I seek leave to have those three groups of statistics incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The result is now clear to all, particularly to workers with family responsibilities. Had the discrimination they are now suffering been at the hands of employers, the trade union movement would not have tolerated it. Had it been at the hands of industrial tribunals, the trade union movement would not have tolerated it. Why should workers tolerate this discrimination because it is at the hand of government? The time has come to establish an industrially and politically supported social wage system which recognises the family as the basic unit of society. This system would require specific government commitments before the trade union movement agree to enter into any future accord or agreed wages policy. Government commitments should include action to lessen the unfair cost and tax burdens on workers with family responsibilities, to restore the true value of family allowances, which are now worth less than two-thirds of their 1976 value, to resist the accord-breaking threats to the spouse rebate, and to give a fair go to all families. I believe that such action would receive the support of all workers genuinely committed to trade union principles of social justice and equity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition wishes to support this matter of public importance. We have no doubt that there has been a substantial loss in net disposable income suffered by Australian families, as set out in the terms of the matter of public importance, and we have no doubt that this is a genuine matter of public importance for all Australians. Family units are an easy mark for government neglect. Families make up those parts of society which are relatively static, which are concerned with keeping jobs, and which are concerned with and often contribute to the better functioning of community structures such as child care, education, charities, nursing homes and voluntary agencies. Often families are heavily involved in making them work. Families are the people who pay their taxes. They tend to be busy people involved in mutual care and too involved in those things to be the kinds of people who take to the streets in vocal protests, as we see so often on our television screens. In that conservative sense of a group in society which tends to maintain and protect the values of that society, our families are not only important but critical to the transmission of the culture and to the care and nurture of our young. More importantly, family units provide irreplaceable services and support for their own members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to make it quite clear that I enter this debate from a very special position. I am a member of such a family. I am from a one-income family and have been married for 28 years. We are part of a very large extended family whose members depend upon each other for mutual support. We have aged parents looking to us for care and we have adult children living at home much of the time. That is the kind of background we come from. We know, and everyone knows, that family life is not all sweetness and light. Not all families are perfect. Family members are human. They can be mutually unkind as well as kind and they can be mutually cruel, but on balance, across the population, family units provide the emotional, physical and financial security which no other social agency can match. We will yield to no one in the concern we feel for the structures of our family, diverse and varied though they may be. We believe that family membership enhances individual happiness and achievement and provides services to the members that cannot be matched in quality by anything government can do, except in those cases where we are dealing with family pathology, when special government help may be needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Where families fail governments have to expend huge sums of money trying to match or at least provide a pale reflection of the services that families normally provide. My daughter worked recently in a youth and community services government receiving home for children of families in crisis. Not only were the tales horrific but she was very distressed by some of the people with whom she interacted and whom she had to help. This was a pale reflection of the kind of environment which families operating properly can provide. Where that happens we find we are in a vicious circle where over-taxed families fail and where, having failed, they force up the welfare bill and provide extra responsibilities for government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have no doubt that the current Government's policies and actions in the years it has been in office have contributed markedly to the pressures under which Australian families suffer. We have no doubt that since the election of the first Hawke Government Australian families have progressively become worse off. Australian families have had less disposable income-certainly less disposable income in real terms. They have had less buying power. I think Senator Harradine, certainly from the terms of this motion, would acknowledge that the economic pressures on our families are among the most difficult to resist. We find Australian children have been suffering. We find that the disastrous record of the Hawke Government in the areas of wages, taxation-particularly the fringe benefits tax-family allowances, the cost of providing housing and shelter and health costs has affected families adversely. The Hawke Government has been so busy patching up problems, putting out bushfires, that it has forgotten the importance of maintaining and strengthening families. With the job that they do and the irreplaceable function that they perform, families are needed for our society to be sustained. By weakening families the Government creates more problems, more hurt and more disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just turn to a few of the areas. Looking at the areas of wages and taxation we see that the real wages of Australian workers have declined not only because of wage discounting but also because their purchasing power has gone down. The discounting has been brought about partly by the fall in value of the Australian dollar, which is another gift of the Hawke Government. That fall was caused by that Government's economic policies. Worse still, we see the decline in the after-tax income, the real take home pay, the money that people use to pay for their needs day by day. Both the average and the marginal rates of tax have increased greatly under Labor and if we look at the total tax take-the numbers of billions of dollars taken from Australian families, from pay as you earn taxpayers-we find that this has increased enormously since the election of the Hawke Government both in dollar terms and in real terms. That money has been taken from families. It is the families that have less money themselves, particularly families on average weekly earnings which are particularly hard hit. I have had two tables prepared in the office of Mr Howard. The first table details the marginal average tax rates for a single income family on average weekly earnings, showing the figures at March 1983, December 1984, June 1986 and what we expect after the first and second rounds of Keating tax cuts, that is, at December 1986 and July 1987. I ask the permission of the Senate to have that table incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. The average tax rate has increased from 17.5 per cent to over 21 per cent and the average marginal tax rate has risen from 30 per cent to 46 per cent. Even after the tax cuts in December, themselves deferred three months from what was promised, and the July tax cuts, if they ever eventuate, the rates which people pay will still be higher than when Labor came to office-and the people who are paying those extra tax rates are the families of Australia. We estimate that each family is $15 per week worse off because of Labor's tax increases. I believe that Senator Harradine offered some figures-I do not know whether they are the same-but in terms of order of magnitude he and I are talking about exactly the same thing. There has been no indexation of the dependent spouse rebate, so families with a parent looking after young children full time have been even more adversely affected. Looking at family allowances, we see that the Labor Government has taken no steps to increase the levels of family allowances, and their value has declined by about 20 per cent since the Labor Government came to office. This could be a loss of about $130 a year to an Australian family with two dependent children. In addition, of course, we know that from 1 January 1987 the family allowance for children over 16 will be means tested, and this could cost families even more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Looking at housing, we discover that we have the highest real housing loan interest rates we have ever had. At the moment people are paying 15 1/2 per cent to try to service their loans so that they can buy a house to shelter the family that they love. The monthly mortgage repayments for a family with a typical 25-year $50,000 home loan have risen by a staggering $152. They have risen from $508 when Mr Hawke was elected to $660 today. That money has to be found by families. I have had Commonwealth car drivers, as we talked in the car going home, saying: `Senator, if there is any further increase in those interest rates I don't know whether I will be able to keep my home. I am working as much overtime as I can, but I do not know whether I will be able to pay the mortgage and keep my home'. People should not have to say those kinds of things. It is the families that are being affected. If we look to private rental accommodation as the alternative we must realise that one is lucky to find any rental accommodation. It is very scarce now in most of the major cities of Australia and we find that the rents that families have had to pay have raced ahead even of inflation, even though wage rises have been somewhat discounted. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the area of health and families, we find that under Medicare costs are up by 40 per cent, so the Medicare levy now has to rise. It will rise by 25 per cent on 1 December. Who will pay the increased levy? It will be Australian families once again. Overall, looking at all of this-wage discounting, tax increases, the real cuts in family allowances, increased housing costs and rising health costs-all of these things have made the average family with two children something like $27 per week worse off. I have another table prepared by Mr Howard's office which sets out the effects of these factors on the net income of a one-income family on average weekly earnings with a dependent spouse and two dependent children.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. Labor has taken more away from the average family per week than the family allowance for one child provides the family each month. The losses have been very considerable, and they have not ended yet. That $27 per week would contribute one-fifth of the monthly cost of the average family mortgage, so it is a very considerable loss. Let us look at the question of inflation. At the same time as families have had all this income loss, costs have risen in Australia very rapidly and the impact of those cost rises has been felt by Australian families. Our inflation rate is 8.9 per cent. That is between five and seven times as high as the inflation rate of other Western countries with which we compare ourselves-especially those countries which are our major trading partners.

<PARA> The Howard alternatives are quite clear and they will benefit families. We will adopt a much more flexible wages policy. I notice that that is part of the motion-that we must look to new approaches to wages. We will want to see employers and employees doing around Australia what was done so successfully at Mudginberri and at the Dollar Sweets Co. Pty Ltd. At Mudginberri a group of workers left to make their own arrangements and ended up better off in net terms. We want all Australians to be able to do that, and if we do it for all Australian workers we are doing it for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> We have promised and we have had on the table income splitting for families as one option, to allow families to lessen the tax burden and increase family spending power. We want to freeze and to cut government expenditure overall so that we reduce the tax burden on those very same families-reduce the tax burden, reduce the inflation rate, reduce the nation's debt and increase the economic power of the families. We will abolish the fringe benefits tax, which of itself has affected and harmed Australian families. We will reduce interest rates with better economic management. We will do it by cutting government spending and so by cutting government borrowing. We will reduce or steady rents simply by abolishing the capital gains tax and by reviewing that ridiculous decision on negative gearing whose only effect has been to dry up the supply of rental accommodation in cities like my city of Sydney. We will reduce health costs. We have set out our health policies. We will assist self-provision for aged Australians by abolishing the assets test and the tax on lump sum superannuation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not be party to the kind of things to which this Government has been party. This is the Government which, having identified poverty traps which are harming Australian families, particularly some single income, one-parent families, and having put in place legislation to relieve them, has decided not to allow that legislation to come into effect for an extra eight months. Perhaps this Government thinks that it will be good for the families who have been affected to have another eight months unable to take steps to relieve themselves of the effects of those poverty traps. There are four million families in Australia and 2,250,000 families with children. The available statistics show that the presence of children is currently the first indicator of whether there is poverty in a family. Senator Harradine drew attention to this matter when he talked about families with children who are bearing the brunt of what is going on in this country. We know that if one looks at families in the poorest quarter of income, one finds that families with children are over-represented. Sole parent families, often the result of the breakdown of marriage, are particularly disadvantaged and over-represented. Most sole parent families fall into this poorest quarter. Of sole parent families with two children, more than three quarters will be in the poorest quarter of incomes, and their situation has worsened since the Labor Government came to office. </PARA>
<PARA> As a nation we do too little to help our families. We permit that sector of our society, our families, to suffer and to endure increasing financial squeeze and hardship. We tolerate children in families being brought up in poverty and in need, often with disastrous long term effects in terms of their adult potential and their personality. What our parties are on about is creating the economic circumstances and the hope for families to succeed. The Liberal-National Party message is one of hope for families, one of success, and that is not consistent with the record of the Hawke Government, under which families have been progressively worse off. In the short term we understand just how severe financial stresses are on families, just how much financial worries are contributing towards the breakdown of marriage, and how financial difficulties are contributing to sending mothers and children into even greater financial and emotional distress. The programs that we have to offer for Australia will improve the economic situation of families, and in so doing will make them and the nation stronger. We believe that Senator Harradine is quite correct to bring before the Senate today a matter of public importance which emphasises the substantial loss in the net disposable income suffered by Australian families. We wish to be associated with the matter of public importance, which is well timed and very important. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating this afternoon a matter of public importance which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The substantial loss in net disposable income suffered by male and female wage and salary earners with family responsibilities by comparison to other wage and salary earners at all levels under Federal and State awards and the need for the Government to redress this situation as a necessary adjunct to a more realistic and just wages policy and to give a fair go for all families. </PARA>
<PARA>There is little to disagree with in that statement. In fact it is the basis of a thorough review of our current social security system which can only go hand in hand with a review of taxation measures-a review which will have a great effect on the disposable income of families. Since 1969 the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has rejected the notion that wage determinations should take into account family responsibilities. I do not think anybody is suggesting that we should go back to the old days of the basic wage-a wage which, theoretically but never practically, was designed to provide for the ordinary needs of a worker his spouse and two or three dependent children. The emphasis on those wage cases from 1969 onwards, and again in 1974 and 1977, was that responsibility for the welfare of families lay with governments through the systems of redistribution traditionally accepted in Australia. I refer to tax transfers, the dependent spouse rebate and child endowment which were in place at that stage. In 1977 the tax relief and the child endowment system, as it had existed for 30 years, was replaced by the Fraser Government by a system of family allowances. In theory, I believe that this was a measure on which there could be very little disagreement. The great problems have developed since then because the family allowance which came into being in 1977 has not kept up with inflation. Its having not been indexed, the real value has declined. Currently, family allowances would need to be increased by some 40 per cent to restore them to the value they held when first introduced in 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to tax relief, turning back the clock on the issue of the basic wage would not be an equitable method of redistribution. It is clear that tax relief as generally understood usually favours those on higher incomes. Attempts made in discussion of this matter of public importance to differentiate between particular households also run the risk of overlooking the needs of many groupings. When we talk about male and female wage and salary earners with family responsibilities by comparison to other wage and salary earners, we must acknowledge the fact that there is an enormously wide range of households in which there are dependent children. Whatever direct income tax measures are taken, little change will be brought about in households on very low incomes. The method that has been developed over the last few years involving a family income supplement for those on very low incomes and wages is included in our social security review, and ways of making that more horizontally and vertically equitable are being seriously discussed. Among wage and salary earners there are very many, both men and women who work part time-men part time workers being more common than they were previously. We are seeing some very interesting changes in the labour force-for example, in the participation rates of sole parents. Possibly the most unexpected change here has been that male sole parents have reduced their participation rate in the work force quite sharply from 94.7 per cent to 79 per cent. The rate for female sole parents has also declined, from 45 per cent to 40.8 per cent. That is a phenomenon to which Senator Harradine and Senator Peter Baume also referred, although somewhat more obliquely, but which is acknowledged to be a result of the disincentives that have been built into our social security and taxation systems over the years, culminating in the poverty traps, the solution to which has, regrettably, been postponed until next July. </PARA>
<PARA> Other groups whose income is dependent on awards of the Federal and State arbitration commissions are those who for some reason are temporarily out of the work force or who are seasonally employed. Those who are temporarily out of the work force on sick leave, maternity leave, compensation, or matters of that kind are also dependent in one way or another, either on the provisions of their awards or on whatever social security provisions can be made for them. Those with the care of young children also come into a wide range of family configurations-some intact families with one or two earners and those who are at least partly dependent upon a non-custodial parent who may or may not fulfil this responsibility. The point cannot be made too strongly that pretty well every household in relation to its earning capacity or income is rarely static. Changes occur over the years, perhaps as the mother leaves the work force for a time and then re-enters it for part time work, which is very common as her children begin to earn, or perhaps as the principal earner returns to part time employment or as either of the earners-assuming there are more than one-leave the work force for a time. Their dependency upon taxation measures will vary quite significantly, as will their dependency on social security measures. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree that the majority of families are necessarily worse off as a result of measures that have been taken by this Government over the last few years. References have already been made to the very important significance of education measures and of the introduction of the universal health scheme. These have meant significant changes to many families and their standard of living-improving it in the case of many low income families. The measures we are continuing to take on housing for low income families and the provision of public housing, although nowhere near adequate-we are certainly not resting on our laurels-are obviously of enormous importance when one is trying to assess whether a particular group in the community is better or worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter of great importance is the provision of children's services which, coupled with the second education opportunities, can have a great deal of effect on whether a woman, particularly, who has the care of children is able to develop her own independence, move outside a purely household existence and provide for her and her children's needs. The increasing participation rate, not just of single parents but of all women in the Australian work force, means that more women have incomes and are in a position to pay income tax, which was not the case before. I am not necessarily insisting that it is a great leap forward to be able to pay income tax, but being in the position of having an independent income has enhanced enormously the standard of living of many women in Australia over the past 10 or 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a little puzzled by Senator Harradine's reference to this Government's aim of having 85 per cent of married women in the work force. If that statement was made, I believe that it was undoubtedly made in the context of making it possible for women, married or otherwise, with dependent children or otherwise, to develop their independence. The surest way out of poverty in Australia or any other industrialised country is certainly by moving into the work force. Although that is not necessarily seen as a socially constructive alternative-in Senator Harradine's words-it is certainly a way by which many families have attained a standard of living which otherwise would not have been possible. It is certainly not an affront to dignity for a family or household to be provided with a decent standard of living, even if for a period this money comes from the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it very encouraging that the question of income support for families and children, which is the basis of the first issues paper from the Social Security Review, is getting so much attention. It is a report which certainly deserves that attention. It would have been relatively easy for this Government, as was the case with other governments, simply to tinker around with the social security system in a way which gave no recognition at all to the enormous range of variables which affect individual families-and not only in relation to taxation or whether they are entitled to spouse rebates or family allowances. A very rough and simplistic approach to these matters is taken by Mr Andrew Hay, the President of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, but that approach is very far from the thoughts of all of us. I do not believe that anyone at all in this Parliament believes, as Mr Hay does, that family allowances should be abolished. He describes family allowances as `a farce'. We know perfectly well that even in middle income families, whom he describes as `leeching off the Government', in many cases the family allowance is the only disposable income available to the mother who usually has the care of the children. </PARA>
<PARA> We are very well aware of the fact that over the years, and very much as a result of many years of conservative government, the position of Australia in the world league, as it were, of provision of family allowances and other supports for families with dependent children has dropped alarmingly. Of all the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, Australia is now in tenth position. With an OECD average of 9 per cent of universal family assistance for a two-child family as a proportion of a net average production worker's wage, Australia's contribution is 4.4 per cent. When we look at another measure-the value of tax relief in cash transfers-Australia's position is even worse. With an average of 11.4 per cent of the average production worker's wage for the OECD as a whole, Australia's contribution is only 5.7 per cent and we are listed fifteenth out of 18 countries. Over the next few months as these discussion papers and issues papers become more widely available, these matters will be dealt with thoroughly and effectively. We hope that within the next few years to make a much more effective contribution to the support of families with children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance today calls for a fair go for all families. Of course, that is a call with which none of use would disagree; but to begin with, we need to be clear about what we are referring to when we speak about families. There is a range of possible definitions. I find some useful comment on this issue from the social justice statement of the Anglican Church of Australia, which points out that perhaps one general definition is that of one or two adults living with one or more dependent children; or an even simpler definition being `where kids live'. That statement recognises that there are now many variations of families in Australia and that in policy making and in our actions we need to approach family life as it is actually experienced-not a mythical approach to some sort of family that may have existed in the past or might exist in our imagination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Anglican Church statement goes on to point out that there are external pressures on families-pressures of unemployment, poor nutrition, homelessness, emotional and physical violence, work demands and poverty; that within families there are internal pressures of violence, incest, child abuse and immature relationships; that the family is placed in the context of its immediate neighbourhood and that whether the community gives support to or ignores vulnerable families also puts stress upon families. </PARA>
<PARA> The report points out that families are the most economic way for people to live because resources are shared on a voluntary basis. It suggests that governments should recognise this and support it. Of course, enormous changes are going on in family structures these days. It is a fact that in general Australian households tend to be getting smaller. While some 60 per cent of Australians still live in nuclear two-parent families, some of which are of a blended nature as a result of remarriages, the proportion of one-parent families has doubled to 13 per cent of all families. Because of contraception and later marriage, 25 per cent of households in 1982 had no children. Birth rates generally are continuing to decline. There are many split households as the divorce rate has increased. There are many children living in de facto family relationships. Many other changes have to be dealt with by families. </PARA>
<PARA> There is evidence of the loss of net disposable income by families, as the matter of public importance indicates. One figure demonstrates that-a figure which was tabled in the Senate last year and which showed that the amount of income tax imposed over the last 10 years on a family with four children living on average weekly earnings has increased by 435 per cent while wages have increased by only 135 per cent. The tax system has changed to the point that individuals are favoured over families. A part of this decline has been caused by the fact that social security allowances have not been indexed. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the major problem facing families in Australia today is poverty. As Professor Cass, who heads the Government's Social Security Review, has stated, the highest incidence of poverty is now among sole parent families headed by women and low income families with four or more children. Poverty is associated with being unemployed or outside the work force. As we have seen so often recently, the incidence of poverty is increasing and is deepening in our community at the moment. That poverty markedly affects families, as Professor Cass has stated. In the last four or five years, families, particularly single-parent families, have slipped further and further below the poverty line-2 to 4 per cent of single parents with up to three children. These are some of the problems faced by families in our society and ones to which we really need to pay the deepest attention. They are problems that affect two million Australians, three-quarters of a million of whom are children. As the matter of public importance states, in this case it is the very low level of disposable income that is the problem-in fact a level of income below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most effective ways of improving this situation, of getting people out of poverty, would be to ensure that more family bread- winners, whether in single parent families or not, are able to secure employment. The level of unemployment among sole parent families, the majority of which are headed by women, is extraordinarily high. Eighty-three per cent are within the social security system. Given that fact, it is significant that we should recognise the obstacles facing women attempting to get employment, particularly women who have the responsibility for families and who have to exercise that responsibility while living below the poverty line. The first difficulty is that which faces everybody seeking employment, that is, the general high level of unemployment still being at 8.4 per cent and there having been a rise in the September quarter. In that context there is strong competition for the available jobs. It is women in our society who still lack qualifications and experience. Even though we are fast approaching the end of the twentieth century and even though we have made advances, women and girls are still not achieving the same level of educational qualifications or the same level of experience and expertise as men. As a result, women are still under represented in high income and high status occupations and professions, and over represented in lower paid and lower status occupations. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent Government policy which will affect families and which apparently will be endorsed by the Opposition-as so many recent Government policies which have hurt families, in particular single-parent female-headed families, have been-is the introduction of the $250 tertiary education fee. Since the abolition of tertiary fees, women have increasingly used, become involved in and been advantaged by increased participation in further education. There is no question that one of the first groups to be disadvantaged by the imposition of the $250 fee will be women. In addition, for all people who are in this situation of poverty, there is the disincentive of the high effective tax rates. The Social Security Review Background Discussion Paper No. 4 has made considerable comment on this, pointing out that for some people it represents an effective marginal tax rate of 100 per cent, but in very many cases it is up to 75 or 80 per cent. That is despite the fact that Government policy, once again supported by the Opposition, has quite recently brought in lower marginal tax rates for those in employment, those living very far from the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA> That disincentive exists. Not only have we lowered the marginal tax rates for those in employment; we have also ensured that the disincentive remains, that the poverty traps legislation is deferred, and that these people will suffer considerable disadvantage as a result. In fact, for a two-parent family, a couple with two children, living on social security and renting, the loss is $31 a week because of the deferral of the poverty traps measures. There are many other figures to match that. The Institute of Family Studies and a number of other authorities have noted that these poverty traps needed to go. They have not gone. That is a matter for shame for those who are responsible. I note that the Australian Democrats were the only people to oppose that measure. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of child care is a significant disincentive for women attempting to get into employment and out of poverty. The provision of child care is not adequate. The cost of child care is beyond most people trying to get into, normally, rather low paid employment, and for those who can achieve higher paid employment there is the fact that, although many other business expenses might be tax deductible, child care certainly is not. </PARA>
<PARA> It also bears mentioning that very often the structure of work, the work place, the hours and so forth, is very much directed towards the masculine roles in society. A good example of that is the new Parliament House, which was designed to be without child care facilities. This goes right through the whole work place. There is no question but that some fundamental changes would remove some of the disincentives for women and also would provide more opportunity for men, too, to spend more time with their families. </PARA>
<PARA> My contribution would not be complete without some comment on the contributions of Opposition and Government spokespeople thus far. It is significant that Senator Peter Baume suggested that the fringe benefits tax was an imposition and had disadvantaged families. It certainly has done that-for those families who were accustomed to an annual overseas trip and those families whose children were attending private schools courtesy of a tax-free concession. I do not see how it could possibly be argued any other way. Senator Baume suggested that we need more Mudginberris. If we are really concerned about families, the last thing we will want is confrontation in our industrial relations system. If that is the best that the Opposition can do, let us hope that that is where its members stay. </PARA>
<PARA> The old sore of income splitting is raised again. We have not seen from the Opposition any firm policy here. We do not know whether it has been costed. But the danger there is that such a system would reduce the Government's income to a level at which benefits, which are already too low, would not be able to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Giles referred to her regret that the poverty traps legislation had been postponed. It is to her credit that she regrets it, but that certainly will not get that $31 a week back to that two-parent family on social security payments and renting their home. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question but that there is potential in the social security review for a major improvement in the way in which we handle the sorts of problems for families about which I have spoken, but it seems to the Australian Democrats that those things for which we have often called are now even more imperative: In particular, that in order for people to get out of poverty, for family breadwinners to be able to seek work in the first place, to take work and still to carry on their responsibilities, there must be a significant increase in the free income levels available to social security recipients; that child allowances and rent allowances should be increased; and that the Government must look again at its priorities and must not penalise those least able to pay. The Government must seek its income from other sources. The Brierleys and the Elliotts of this world, whose companies are paying 10 per cent or less in taxation, should not be able to hold their heads up in a world in which people living below the poverty level can have to pay 75 per cent tax rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating, as a matter of public importance proposed by Senator Harradine of Tasmania, the following matter:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The substantial loss in net disposable income suffered by male and female wage and salary earners with family responsibilities by comparison to other wage and salary earners at all levels under Federal and State awards and the need for the Government to redress this situation as a necessary adjunct to a more realistic and just wages policy and to give a fair go for all families. </PARA>
<PARA>We have just heard Senator Giles and Senator Powell talking about the poverty situation and not really applying their minds to this matter of public importance. However, I welcome the presence in the chamber of Senator Graham Richardson, back from Coventry, or Singleton, or wherever it was. It is marvellous to see him back here, because he is an Australian Labor Party senator who understands the difficulties which bank clerks and others are suffering under this Government. It is marvellous to see him back at last. He is tending to hide from some of his colleagues, but we welcome his return. We welcome the things that he said at Singleton, where he pointed out the truth of the matters which the Opposition parties and, in particular, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) have been saying for so long: That this Government is attacking the poor people of the nation, not the wealthy people. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the subject of this debate, the Australian Labor Party has always had an unwritten philosophy. It does not express it publicly or put it in its written documents, but the truth is that most members of the Labor Party have a sort of unwritten philosophy of destroying the family unit. There are honourable exceptions, but overall one sees them constantly on the attack in relation to the family unit. Take, for example, the most recent appointment to the Office of the Status of Women, which advises the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in relation to women's affairs. The Prime Minister has appointed one Ms Suzanne Brooks. She has spoken favourably of Sweden's 85 per cent participation rate in the work force by married women. She is aiming to get a participation rate of about 85 per cent. She says that the key to all that is to make it possible for women to have children and to keep on working, if they choose, while they are having children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine and I agree that it is a difficult task, although some countries seem not to have worried too much about it. There was a time in China and a time in Europe immediately following the Second World War when people did not seem to bother about it. If this Government wants to bring us down to the standards that obtained in Europe shortly after the Second World War, why does it not make that public so that we know what it is on about?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ms Brooks has advocated the abolition of the spouse rebate. At the same time, of course, she is not interested in that rebate because she and her husband, together, would be on an annual income of about $100,000. Let me tell the Senate what was written about Ms Brooks in the Australian Women's Weekly in May this year. This is what was reported:</PARA>
<PARA> Sue and her husband Ray, a lecturer in economics and industrial law at the Phillip Institute of Technology in Coburg, are childless. </PARA>
<PARA> `We made a conscious decision not to have children. We're both busy people and at that stage child care was even harder to come by', she says. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, she and Ray have a `99-year lease' on two Siamese cats. </PARA>
<PARA> Ray will cat sit while Sue is in Canberra. She plans to rent an apartment there and fly home every few weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> `The separation doesn't bother us,' she says. `We've always lived fairly independent lives, and Ray recognises the job is important.'</PARA>
<PARA>That is the person the Prime Minister has chosen to advise him in relation to women's affairs. That is the problem with the Australian Labor Party. This is just the sort of philosophy that the ALP has running right through it in relation to the family and the family unit. Yet, now it is in government it can see the difficulties. It is beginning to appreciate that the family unit is absolutely vital to the future of the nation, that the family unit provides the best form of family care and that no government agency or government employee can ever step in and replace the sort of family care which used to exist before the introduction of the incredible so-called Family Law Act which brought such disharmony to this country and which has resulted in multiple marriages with children of his and her's and theirs and other combinations. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me get back to the subject under debate. Under this Government the average family man with a spouse and two dependent children is paying almost $30 a week more in income tax than he was paying when this Government came into office. The so-called tax cuts now scheduled for December this year and July next year will do little to remedy that situation. Even after those tax cuts are introduced completely by July of next year the average wage earner will still be on a marginal tax rate of 40c in the dollar. Glory be! What on earth has happened to this country? How much money does this Government want to take from the taxpayers of this nation? Until December of this year they will be paying 46c in the dollar, and there was a time under this Government when they were paying a marginal tax rate of 47c in the dollar. When the Hawke Government came into office in March of 1983 the average wage earner and family man was on a marginal tax rate of only 30c in the dollar, and we were concerned about that. Members of the Fraser Government's back bench were saying that the marginal rate of 30c in the dollar was too high, and the Government at that time was looking to see what it could do to lower it. Under the Hawke Government the marginal rate rose to 47c in the dollar, has been reduced to 46c in the dollar and after the tax cuts will be 40c in the dollar. Of course that is not unusual with Labor governments, Mr Acting Deputy President. You will recall that under the prime ministership of Mr Whitlam the marginal rate rose to 44c in the dollar. It was the Fraser Government which managed to drag it back to 30c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an enormous disincentive to people in Australia to go out and work harder to earn more money when they have to pay 40c in the dollar tax on every extra dollar they manage to earn. The average family man on average weekly earnings with a dependent spouse and dependent children currently pays an average tax rate of 20.5 per cent. So he has a marginal rate which will ultimately be 40c in the dollar but his average rate is 20.5 per cent, compared with 17.5 per cent when the Fraser Government left office. It is quite clear that all the Government is doing with these so-called tax cuts is giving back some of the extra tax it has taken from taxpayers since it came into power. In fact, it has been calculated that an additional $15 a week in income tax cuts on top of the Keating tax cuts would be required to reduce the income tax burden of a single income family on average earnings to the same level that applied when this Government came into office in March 1983. For a single income family on average earnings the tax cuts will be $15 light. In addition, the Hawke Government has dramatically increased fuel excise, it has increased the Medicare levy and it has increased and introduced a new range of wholesale taxes. It has abolished the concessional expenditure rebate which was of assistance to many large families and was some partial recognition of the increased costs suffered by those families. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me draw attention to some figures calculated by my colleague in the House of Representatives, Mr Alasdair Webster. He has calculated that an ordinary single income family on $39,000 a year with three teenage children has only about $100 a week of what he has called `free' income. In other words, after allowing for tax and the estimated cost of housing and feeding a family, out of a quite substantial salary such a family would be left with only $100 a week to spend on food and clothing for the two adults and other things. He has also drawn attention to the fact that a single mother on the supporting parent's benefit with one young child may have as much as $172 as week so-called `free' income-in other words, $70 a week more than the so-called well-off family. The figures are clearly set out by Mr Webster. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute of Family Studies carried out a household survey into the cost of feeding and clothing children in a family with an income of less than $180 a week. It found that it cost $19.73 a week for a two-year old child, $25.31 for a five-year old, $31.03 for an eight-year old and $49.04 for a teenager. It also surveyed the costs for a family with an income of $425 a week, and the costs for such a family were substantially higher. The Institute points out that the family allowance of about $5.20 a week for the first child is grossly inadequate compensation for the family. Families in this country are being totally overlooked by this Government. Mortgage interest rates are now at an incredibly high level. People are paying an interest rate of 15 1/2 per cent on their mortgages, and anyone trying to buy a house at present is being sucked into paying other massively high interest rates because this Government is keeping up interest rates in order to bring in deposits from overseas investors to paper over the crack in the monthly export-import deficit. Health care costs under Medicare are exploding out of all proportion. The inflation rate is still being maintained at an extraordinarily high figure in relation to the rates of our overseas trading partners, and it is the relationship between our inflation rate and that of our overseas trading partners which makes life so difficult for many people. The Opposition certainly supports this matter of public importance raised by Senator Harradine and congratulates him on bringing it forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance brought forward by Senator Harradine goes to the question of how we can maintain at a decent standard of living the families of this nation. The point has been made again and again-it is a point that certainly nobody here would disagree with and with which very few people in the community would disagree-that the family is the fundamental unit of society. That statement has often been made, and it is clearly recognised by all. There has been a tendency in the debate to distinguish between the family and others, as if we have not all been at one stage or another part of a family. The fact of the matter is that we are all born and, hopefully, we have a family context in which to grow up. That family may split-unfortunately there is too much of that these days, caused by, amongst other things, economic problems-nevertheless, the concept of the family being the basic unit is certainly one that is accepted by and large by the whole community. The real question is how government, how any institution, can best provide for that family in the society in which we are presently living.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Harradine, in his matter of public importance debate today, raised the question of both Federal and State award wages. I think he properly highlighted the part that the union movement can play and should play in this matter. He indicated, as he has before in the Senate, the great importance of the part that the unions play in the proper running of this country and the proper protection of the family. Senator Harradine, in speaking on the Australian Bill of Rights Bill earlier this year, pointed out that under one interpretation of the Bill of Rights as it relates to unions the fundamental rights of unions to operate in this country, and indeed elsewhere, may in some way be prejudiced. He indicated then the danger that that would bring to Australian society as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, of course, has also worked out, has divined, that the family is important, as has just been said by Senator Lewis and as was said earlier by Senator Peter Baume. But the protection that is afforded the family by the unions in their proper operations is condemned by the Opposition. It is difficult to accept that members of the Opposition get up in this chamber and say `The family ought to be protected economically. It should be given proper conditions to work in. Enough money shall be brought home', yet that very institution, the union movement, which is there to allow appropriate amounts of money to be brought into the home so that the family can be properly looked after, is the object of attack by the Opposition. It has declared that, when it comes to office, it will bring in very stringent industrial legislation to ensure that the activities of that institution that looks after the family's income, or helps to do so, will be curtailed. The Opposition wishes to do that for the very simple reason that it believes that wages that are presently paid are too high and must be reduced, that the social wage which includes such things as Medicare benefits that are paid to families must be reduced, and that generally institutions such as the union movement and programs such as Medicare which give protection to the family should be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is very interesting that members of the Opposition come into this chamber and proclaim, as they have, that they are interested in the family and that they want to do something about the family-I am sure that that is absolutely correct and that they want to do something about the family-but that they then propose a course of conduct which would lead to families being left defenceless and unprotected, unable to negotiate a decent wage, having lost the protection they had by way of the commonality that is provided by the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing I want to say is that the Opposition, in attempting to help the family, as it says it wants to, would abolish the fringe benefits tax, would abolish the capital gains tax imposed upon property and would generally disrupt the taxation package that this Government has brought forward, quite properly, to ensure that the revenue gathered by these measures is redistributed to those who need it. No matter how people in this chamber go through the figures, the fact of the matter is that when this Government came to power the lowest rate at which people were taxed was 30c in the dollar. By the time next year has come and gone that rate will be reduced to 24c. Indeed, that 24c level will be reached by 1 December this year. When this Government came to office the highest level was 60c and that will now be reduced to 49c in the dollar. No matter how the figures are worked out, that is a fact which stands before the country and before this Senate to indicate that there is and will be a continuing lowering of the tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that members of the Opposition have said that they are interested in the family, but there is no indication of how they would arrange things so that the impact on the family wage-the impact on all wages for that matter-would be lessened in the way described in the matter of public importance. Members of the Opposition say that they would abolish the capital gains tax, which is a tax to ensure that those people who used to be able to avoid paying taxes by buying large farms and large businesses and converting their income into a capital asset that did not attract tax, pay their proper tax so that the people who earn income and are not able to convert it into capital do not have to pay as much. It is a little strange to hear members of the Opposition getting up in this chamber and proclaiming, as they do, that they are interested in the family and that they are going to make sure that the finances that are available to the family stay with the family and do not disappear in tax, when they oppose, for example, this Government's attempts to redistribute tax in a fairer way. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition say that they will relieve the taxes on companies. The Sydney Morning Herald of Wednesday, 29 October 1986, indicates the sort of tax that some companies are paying. The Opposition has said that, in the interests of helping the family, it will see to it that the taxes of these companies are reduced. The article in the Sydney Morning Herald states:</PARA>
<PARA> Those most successful at minimising their tax bill-</PARA>
<PARA>what are being spoken about here are companies-</PARA>
<PARA>include some of Australia's best-known companies:</PARA>
<PARA> Ron Brierley's Industrial Equity Ltd paid 4.66 per cent in tax and his Southern Farmers group paid 5.06 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> John Elliott's Elders-IXL paid 10.35 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> John Spalvins' David Jones paid 10.75 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland Press paid 7.13 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> Alan Bond's Bond Corp paid 13.95 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> George Herscu's Hooker Corporation paid 16.8 per cent . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And so the article goes on. Yet this is part of the program that the Opposition will put into operation if it comes to government. It is part of its proposition that the tax on these companies be reduced. If the taxes are reduced further, who will pay them? Certainly it will be the man who gets out and works for these companies-the average working man. If the general tax propositions put by the Opposition are adopted the family will be in a disastrous state because of the imposition of taxes upon them to replace what this Government presently gets from companies, from large scale capital gains and from the fringe benefits tax. The fringe benefits tax, after all, is a tax that goes to a question of equity because it states that not only income which most families receive as a way of supporting themselves should be taxed but also those company cars that people get, those free loans and those school fees that are paid should be taxed. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at what this Government has done since coming to office in respect of the family, which has helped the family, the sorts of statements that are being made about the Government tend to pale. I can give some examples. The Government has introduced a number of policies which considerably help families. First of all, there is the first home owners assistance scheme, which provides grants of up to $6,000 to persons who buy their own homes. Secondly, there is the Medicare system, which Senator Lewis attacked but which provides cover for every family in Australia at a rate decided according to the level of income and not at a rate as was formerly the situation, dictated by some private company which simply says: `This is the rate we are going to fix'. Medicare is a system which allows people to obtain medical care at a rate they can afford. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, there is a 70 per cent increase in the family income supplement, additional benefit for children, and a 100 per cent increase in the mother-guardian allowance. Fourthly, there has been a substantial increase in the benefits and allowances paid to unemployed young people and those undertaking training courses and full time study. There is the Priority One scheme, the scheme to have young people educated, and the scheme to see that they obtain work experience. In other words, this Government has set up a series of schemes to help people get into the work force and hopefully to earn more and more as the economy recovers. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, these sorts of schemes are condemned by the Opposition. Presumably it would abolish them if it ever were to come to power, but it has not at any stage suggested what it would do as an alternative. It is very surprising-although, if one thinks about it, perhaps not so surprising-to have members of the Opposition make declarations of regard for the family and all sorts of statements which could be best described as pious, yet not produce any alternative to the schemes which are presently operating under this Government. They are operating certainly in a difficult financial climate; nobody denies that. The financial climate has been brought upon the country by policies of the past, going well back into the 1960s. Certainly there have been reductions in the standard of living because wages have been reduced. They have been reduced in an equitable way in accordance with a scheme that has been worked out with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Nevertheless, this country is going forward with social cohesion. </PARA>
<PARA> Compare that with the situation that would exist if the Opposition came to power. In that case war would be declared upon those representatives of the workers who protect their wages-a war which would lead to social dislocation and which in the end would disrupt the family by affecting the amount of money that comes in, by causing strife and by generally bringing upon us quite severe social dislocation. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the family must be looked after. Of course it is the centre of this community. Of course it must be given proper economic protection. This Government is doing that, in conjunction not only with the unions but also with the whole community and the commercial and business world. Agreements are being reached in the interests of obtaining a fair go, not only economically but also socially, for all Australians. All Australians have at one time or other been in families. Most Australians, fortunately, are in that happy state. Let us hope that will continue. If happiness is to be obtained anywhere, it is to be obtained in the family. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The presentation of the annual report of the Department of the Treasury provides an opportunity for honourable senators to speak on virtually any area of government policy because the Treasury is perhaps the most pervasive of all government departments. One could say a great deal about this Labor Government's policies at this time, about policies which have produced an inflation rate in Australia more than four times higher than that of our major trading partners, an inflation rate that anyone who shops for food or clothing or any other item knows is rising day by day, week by week, month by month. It is a Labor government whose appetite for taxpayers' money to spend on its own behalf knows no bounds, which has led to the highest level of taxation in our history. It is a government whose extravagant spending habit has forced interest rates to the highest level in our history because it has had neither the ability to discipline itself nor the courage to take the tough decisions which are necessary if Australians are to maintain, let alone improve, their living standards. It is a government whose policies are destroying incentive and enterprise in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> One could continue almost ad infinitum with this litany of economic mismanagement, but I will not because I want to spend the remainder of my time putting on the public record my appreciation and, I am sure, the appreciation of successive governments and this Parliament for the wonderful public service rendered to this nation by a senior officer who is retiring this week after 43 years with the Australian Treasury. I refer to Dr R. J. Whitelaw, OBE, AM, who is currently the First Assistant Secretary to the Treasury's Overseas Economic Relations Division. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob Whitelaw has served under 11 Prime Ministers and, by my calculations, more than a dozen Treasurers. He has represented Australia in London as our senior economic and financial representative; in Washington as Australia's Executive Director on the boards of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank; and in Manila as Australia's Executive Director on the Asian Development Bank. Dr Whitelaw has been a senior member of Australian delegations to more than 24 annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. His whole working career of 43 years has been spent in international economics. He has played a major policy advisory role in Australia's participation in international economic and monetary affairs, going back to the formation in the mid-1940s of those gigantic pillars of international post-war reconstruction, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, better known as GATT. </PARA>
<PARA> Later, in the 1960s Dr Whitelaw played a significant role in seeking and obtaining Australian membership of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and, in the 1970s, in the new arrangements which followed the collapse of the Bretton Woods international monetary system based on fixed exchange rates. Dr Whitelaw is arguably Australia's best known and most respected economist in international economic matters. I could say much more about Bob Whitelaw's career of service to the Australian people, but time prevents me. Suffice it to say that this week a very distinguished public servant retires. His advice and counsel will be sorely missed by this Government and future governments and in the world's international economic forums. May his retirement be long and very enjoyable. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the first full annual report that we have had from the Commission for the Future. In speculating on the future for the Commission for the Future I am tempted to say that this will be the first and last annual report from the Commission for the Future. The policy of the Opposition is that, when returned at the next election, this is one of the organisations established by this Government which will be wound up. That is not to say that some of the work and some of the projects undertaken by the Commission for the Future are not without merit and it would be churlish of me not to mention in particular the seminars which the Commission has been organising and which have been very well attended by members of the Parliament. Two of them have already been held. The first of them, given by Sir Gustav Nossal, was a very interesting and useful introduction to issues in biotechnology. The second, given by Mr Fred Hilmer, certainly provoked some discussions on the future of work in Australia. A third seminar is scheduled, I think, for next week. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Opposition believes, and it has long been my view, that a body specifically established with a budget of some half million dollars or whatever it is to undertake the sort of work which the Commission has before it is not the most appropriate way for the Parliament to be kept informed or indeed for issues to be raised in the wider public arena. I certainly believe that in the selection of the Chairman of the Commission the Government got the Commission off to a wrong start straightaway. I believe that, if the intention of the Government and in particular the intention of the Minister for Science (Mr Barry Jones) was to raise a serious discussion on issues of scientific and technological significance in the parliamentary and public arenas, Mr Adams was not the appropriate person to be given that responsibility. I must say that his attitudes and the statements which he has made both about the work of the Commission and the various other bodies which he heads or participates in on behalf of this Government have been singularly unhelpful to an attempt to advance discussion and debate about science and technology issues in Australia. It is interesting, for instance, that the Commission for the Future indicates in the report that at least one of the models used in its establishment was the model in New Zealand. Anybody familiar with the history of the Commission for the Future operations in New Zealand will know that that body had to be wound up by the Government because it did not achieve the objectives which had been set for it but went off on various romps of its own.</PARA>
<PARA> What it seems to me is clearly needed is the establishment of a body somewhat akin to the United States Office of Technology Assessment which would be able to provide to the Parliament and, through the Parliament, to the wider community a series of discussion papers or analyses of major issues which would bring science and technology issues before the Parliament in a less jargon-ridden form and in a less `pop' form that the Commission for the Future has attempted. I believe that a body somewhat akin to the Office of Technology Assessment is clearly what is needed. We will have an opportunity to discuss some of these matters, including the parliamentary Senate Committee on Science, Technology and the Environment, when legislation currently before the House of Representatives comes to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, some of the activity undertaken by the Commission for the Future is valuable. It could, however, be better undertaken and more effectively and cost efficiently undertaken by other arrangements. They will be put in place when the Opposition parties are elected to government at the next election and the Commission for the Future in its current form will be abolished and restructured in a way in which what ought to be the primary goals of informing the public and the Parliament about issues of science and technology can be undertaken more effectively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose that what Senator Puplick has really said is that, given his Party's policy, he has to see the Commission for the Future into oblivion if the Opposition finally gets back into government. Underneath that statement though was a fairly generous concession that the Commission for the Future, or something like it, is more than needed in this country. The Opposition's policy on this is simply to abolish it. Furthermore, that abolition was made the subject of a throwaway joke by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) when he addressed the nation earlier this year. I think that indicates a very poor assessment of the needs of Australia now and in the future. Many of Australia's problems, if not all in economic terms, have arisen because of bad judgments in the 1950s, the 1960s and even earlier as to the future of Australia. If this country needs anything, it needs a body to look into the future and to plot courses that it should follow so that it can get out of its present difficulties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission for the Future, whose Chairman, Mr Phillip Adams, has been condemned in fairly round terms, has operated well under him. There are in its secretariat two people who ought to be mentioned because they have been particularly diligent in putting forward in the community ideas as to where we are going, which ideas are not only properly but also essentially put forward. They are Ms Rhonda Galbally and Dr Louise Crossley who have come to Canberra on two occasions to present for the members of this Parliament matters concerning the future. As Senator Puplick said, Dr Gustav Nossal came here. He is an outstanding scientist who gave to those members of this Parliament who wanted to hear him an idea of where we should be going in the future. I note that the Victorian Government has adopted a lot of the material that he put before us and is going forward, I think properly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's communications program, set out on pages 13 and 14 of the report, indicated the sorts of bodies that the Commission has addressed-bodies which will train our future scientists and our future community leaders. This Commission for the Future, particularly under the auspices of Rhonda Galbally and Louise Crossley, will direct those people, those leaders of the future, into the areas that are appropriate. For too long this country has lived in cultural servitude to overseas countries. It has adopted its culture, its science, its technology and its industry programs from overseas. It has been left behind in all those areas to the extent that we are now in all sorts of economic difficulties whereas other countries are not. If honourable senators look at the countries which have set up bodies such as the Commission for the Future they will see what I mean. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government, in setting up the Commission for the Future, followed the lead of several overseas countries, notably Sweden-which has a very successful body-Switzerland, West Germany, New Zealand and the United States, all of which have had futures thinking and planning bodies for several years. In the United States of America alone there are 31 State futures commissions. Given that and given the general regard around the world for these sorts of bodies, we now have an Opposition which joyfully looks ahead to crushing not only this commission but all it stands for, which is forward thinking as to where this country ought to go, thinking of the sorts of aspects we ought to be looking at, thinking about technology and thinking about all those areas which can lead us to the future. Instead, with a sneer, the Opposition would throw away all those opportunities so that this country would be left, as it presently is, wandering around loosely looking for overseas directions. Those overseas directions come too late to be of salvation to this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Cooney in this matter. I am deeply disappointed with the Opposition's statement that it would dismantle the Commission for the Future if it came into power. I suppose it is what we must come to expect from it. It consists of conservative parties rather than liberal parties. Members of the Opposition would like to see the world stay exactly as it is and the Commission for the Future is suggesting that there can and will be change in Australia. I would like to join Senator Cooney in supporting the Commission and in congratulating Ms Rhonda Galbally who has done a wonderful job in communicating some of the more complex ideas and advances in science within this country and in the rest of the world to ordinary Australians. Senator Puplick seemed to imply a type of elitist attitude which suggests that the only way in which the public of Australia can gain information about science and technological development in Australia is through the Parliament. He wants a body which, I suppose, would be fairly dull and dry and would put out material in the right type of jargon maybe for communicating between scientists and parliamentarians. The parliamentarians would then go out and sell science. I think we have very little hope of that type of thing happening. We have in this Parliament, unfortunately, mainly lawyers and accountants. We have very few people who are scientists. I say to Senator Cooney that the lawyers are very useful, but in this area of science we have a very small voice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been very impressed with the program of education of parliamentarians into which the Commission has entered. The seminars which have been held on Tuesday nights have had two excellent speakers. I note with enormous anticipation and pleasure that future programs for education of parliamentarians are planned in the areas of information technology in law and education, Australia's natural and agricultural resources and in the commodities trade. So it looks as if we will have an exciting program presenting some of the advances in areas such as computing, information technology, the genetic pool as a resource, and the effect of demographic change on the economic and social implications of the development of new scientific ideas. All these programs which have been produced for the parliamentarians have also been taken up by Robin Williams in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation science programs. These programs have been broadcast on radio and they offer a reasonable forum for the people of Australia to learn something about these new technologies. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is essential that we keep something like the Commission for the Future. It is not an expensive commodity; it is very cheap for what it is achieving. It is achieving a popularisation of science. It is making people aware of new developments, whether in biotechnology, materials science or space technology. It is actually turning these ideas into household words and making certain that the people of Australia are capable of adapting and facing the future with the same excitement that those people who understand science have about our future and about our development of technology. This is a job which is being well done by the Commission for the Future and for which it should be commended. I commend both the report and the Commission to this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to delay the Senate but I feel that it is important to observe what is contained in Appendix 1 of the last page of the annual report of the Commission for the Future. Appendix 1 deals with programs and projects which presumably have been undertaken or will be undertaken by the Commission for the Future. I draw the attention of the Senate to a program relating to technology and development of a productive culture and the project which is described as `Unions of the Future'. I cannot for the life of me see where in the membership of the Commission for the Future there are sufficient capabilities to address that particular subject. That subject has been given a run over the course many times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recall that when I first became an official of a trade union way back in 1959 or 1960 people were saying that one of the major problems was the structure of the trade union movement. Of course, others were saying we should get rid of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. At that time, incidentally, it was the communist manifesto within the trade union movement to get rid of the Arbitration Commission. Now it seems to be the new establishment's manifesto. Nevertheless, we have this sort of suggestion to do this and do that, forgetting, of course, that the essential element for orderly industrial progress is that the persons within the system desire to see the system work. That is the essential element. All of these ideas about structure, about the unions of the future and so on may be relevant debating points, but they do not go to the central issue. After all, these matters have been considered by a number of commissions and committees. I recall, for example, that the Australian Science and Technology Council did a report on technological change and employment. There is also a reference by this Senate to its Standing Committee on Science, Technology and the Environment. There was, of course, as honourable senators will know, the Senate select committee which I had the honour to chair on industrial relations legislation. There is a whole host of areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know quite what the Commission for the Future is doing in respect of this particular area. Someone might say: `Well, unions of the future is a narrow area'. But my concern is that so often people address that issue from on high. They do not even go to the rank and file to see what the membership of the union movement wants. After all, they are the people who ought to have the say; we should not have persons such as commissioners for the future imposing upon the ordinary rank and file what they consider to be the unions of the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, this particular question goes to other areas as well. The Commission, in its latest publication, which is a rather hep, glossy publication-I do not have it with me-talks about one of its projects involving biotechnology. I do not see it here in the appendix number 1. I would be interested to know, for example, whether the Commission has been through all of the evidence that we on the Senate Select Committee on the Human Embryo Experimentation Bill 1985 have gone through. We received some 273 submissions; we waded through those submissions. We heard evidence from 64 people. There are, I think, seven books of Hansard verbatim evidence; and we gave a report to this Parliament. This is the sort of way to deal with these questions, rather than through a non-elected body such as the Commission for the Future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the annual report of the Commission for the Future from a number of points of view, but I am moved particularly to do so because in the early 1980s a body known as Australian Frontier had for two years running annual future directions conferences. In 1982 I was privileged to participate in the second of those conferences, which seem not to have taken place since. That conference addressed the issues of the minerals boom and whether that would be the future for Australia. It was an exciting and rewarding experience. Perhaps one of the most significant things that arose from that conference was from a very disparate group of people a feeling that Australia needed some kind of futures institute to operate on a regular basis in examining issues of the future. It was not until the Commission for the Future was formed and became operational in February of this year that such a body existed in this country. I am not sure that that body is exactly as was envisaged in the Australian Frontier Conference, but in my contacts with the Commission for the Future I have felt it to be an extraordinarily successful and potentially important group for the future of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a member of Parliament I find the remarks in the report on page 5 which refer to there being no more important group for focusing and reflecting community expectations than parliamentarians, and the words that follow that passage, rather polite. It suggests that parliamentarians often have little opportunity to consider issues that are not immediate and are beyond party policy, the next Budget or the current parliamentary schedule. That is very polite and puts the matter mildly. If there is any group in the community that needs its vision drawn further into the future it is parliamentarians. I have no doubt that the longer I stay here the more I will believe that. Here in the chamber this afternoon we had a good instance of some people having problems with the present, let alone with the future, when earlier in the day we heard a senator grappling with the thought that women might actually have a choice; complaining about what has happened because of the introduction of the Family Law Act-that women are not now staying where they should be, in their homes, whether or not they are miserable or suffering physically or emotionally. </PARA>
<PARA> Women as much as anyone else have a right to choices. That is a fact of the present, and hopefully will be even more significantly a fact of the future. It is in that sort of area that a body such as the Commission for the Future can play a significant role in drawing the attention, particularly of parliamentarians but of the rest of the community also, to what is likely to happen. This report shows how already the Commission for the Future has spread its influence right across the spectrum. I am greatly looking forward to my first participation in one of the seminars provided for parliamentarians next week. I note from the report that the Victorian Parliament is planning to use the good offices of the Commission for the Future. I can only hope that certain other parliaments in other States will take the opportunity to give their parliamentarians a change to consider issues of the future, guided and encouraged by the Commission for the Future. I, too, wish the Commission well and commend the report. I seek leave, Mr Deputy President, to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report by the Standing Committee on Education and the Arts is one in a series of seven reports that deal with the various papers and annual reports of statutory authorities and departments that are tabled in the Senate. The public might wonder what happens when hundreds of reports are tabled. In the last half an hour senators have commented for a period of up to five minutes on various reports and papers received by the Senate, but it is our procedure to refer annual reports from statutory authorities to the various standing committees of the Senate for them to consider whether they want to follow up matters more particularly. The Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts has taken that course and we now have seven such reports before us dealing with items arising from annual reports. The report that is to hand concerns the annual reports of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for 1983-84 and 1984-85. In particular we wished to examine more closely some aspects of the ABC's radio broadcasts in Queensland. Consequently public hearings were held in Queensland in February this year. The outcome of those hearings and the Committee's deliberations are in this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sport on radio can be controversial, particularly when an event of national interest is not broadcast in a region, especially by the ABC whose radio stations have the best coverage of remote areas and country areas generally. Also, a sports service on radio can be controversial when, after many years of covering a sport at particular times in the week, that service is abruptly and permanently discontinued. It is with such an event in mind relating to the broadcasting of sport in Queensland that we came to focus on some particular areas of inquiry. However, my interest in this inquiry has not been aroused by the fact that it concerned a sporting service, nor that it concerned a radio broadcast or Queensland. My interest in this inquiry and in the report before the Senate centres entirely on the accountability of the ABC to Parliament-and through Parliament to the people of Australia. I believe, and I know that the Senate believes, that the ABC should be properly accountable to Parliament. The ABC is a Commonwealth statutory body and is governed by the legislation of the Commonwealth Parliament which created it. The ABC, like other Commonwealth statutory bodies, receives almost all its revenue from taxpayers through the annual Budget decisions of the Commonwealth Government and the decisions subsequently made by the House of Representatives and here in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> In this report the Senate Committee has described a serious breakdown in the ABC's willingness to be accountable to Parliament. I describe this as a breakdown because from the outset and from the highest authority in the ABC, the Board itself, there was a determination earlier this year not to co-operate with the Senate inquiry. The stance adopted by the Board flowed on in all the following months from this decision by the ABC Board. The decision not to co-operate is reflected in the ABC's written submission to the Committee. It is reflected in the ABC's Press statements and the disparaging leaks the Corporation made about the inquiry. It is reflected in the ABC's limiting its representatives appearing before the hearings. It is also reflected in the ABC's appointing legal counsel to attend the public hearings with the ABC witnesses. Quite dramatically and most unfortunately, it is reflected in the ABC's refusal to answer questions. The deadlock that ensued and the complete farce that developed in the Brisbane hearings is further evidence. Finally, the ABC refused, at the level of the Chair of the Board, the General Manager and the Board itself, to be conciliatory and it failed to resolve the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> This is very clearly brought to the attention of the Senate in the report before us. All these events are described in chapter 4 of the report-I believe very adequately-and there is no need to go over them in detail here. I note only that, having been a senator now for more than eight years and having participated in dozens of inquiries, I have never encountered or even thought possible such a recalcitrant and reluctant witness. In my view, the ABC has been extraordinarily lacking in responsibility. I hope that the Senate's resolution in this debate and in response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts will put this precedent, this kind of impasse, entirely behind us. The ABC must see itself as being properly accountable to Parliament, accountable to the Senate and to the Senate's committees. Now that there have been changes in the Board and the general management of the ABC and also changes for the ABC, in this year's Budget, I expect there will be a full acceptance by the Corporation of its proper accountability to Parliament and through Parliament to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer briefly to three particular aspects of the ABC's argument. First, in section 4.8 of the Senate Committee's report we highlight the principal summary statement the ABC put to us. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 guarantees the editorial independence of the Corporation's program services. The ABC holds its power to make programming decisions as a trust on behalf of the people of Australia, for which it is accountable to Parliament, but in which by law and convention, neither the Government nor Parliament seeks to intervene. </PARA>
<PARA>I regard that statement as circular and self-serving and I reject it. I do not reject that the Parliament should not interfere in the programming decisions of the ABC, but I reject the conundrum at the end of that statement whereby the ABC is saying that it is accountable to Parliament but `by law and convention' it is not, in effect, accountable to Parliament. In other words, it wants to be accountable in theory, but not in practice. Also at section 5.5 and section 5.9 of the report, the ABC sets out its view that it wishes to pick and choose which committees of the Parliament it will answer and which it will not. It said that it would be quite all right to answer questions if they had been put by the Estimates Committee of the Senate, but not if they had been put by a standing committee of the Senate. I reject this totally. Also, the ABC tries to appeal for protection from interference because it claims that its programming decisions are not to be interfered with. I agree with that, but I do not think that that limited programming area should be extended to the wider and general decisions the ABC has made. It must be fully accountable for its wider and general decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time available to me, and bearing these points in mind, I foreshadow an amendment to the motion that the Senate take note of the report. With such amendment, the motion would read:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report and</PARA>
<PARA> (a) agrees with the Committee's conclusion that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's approach to the Committee's inquiry was incorrect and that the ABC and any summoned officers of the ABC should have answered the Committee's questions; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) asserts that the ABC and any other witnesses to Senate Committees have an obligation to co-operate and to answer questions within the terms of reference of Senate Standing Committees and Senate Estimates Committees alike; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) requests the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts to consider, in the light of its own evidence and the answers subsequently given by the ABC to Senate Estimates Committees whether further investigation is required. </PARA>
<PARA>Time prevents me from continuing now and I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1983-84 annual report of the Australian Capital Territory Gaming and Liquor Authority-or GALA for short-was not tabled until some 14 months after the end of the relevant financial year and the financial statements of the Australian Capital Territory Totalisator Agency Board operations and poker machine operations were qualified by the Auditor-General. The Committee received explanations for the delay in tabling the annual report from the Authority and from the Minister for Territories (Mr Scholes). A number of factors contributed to the delay, including lengthy negotiations with the Audit Office on the form and content of the financial statements, staff absences over holiday periods, and difficulty in deciding on the appropriate policy on one matter. The Committee observes that not all the delay is adequately explained. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gaming and Liquor Authority's enabling legislation does not require an annual report to be made. However, the Betting Ordinance and the Poker Machine Ordinance require an annual report to be prepared for the Minister, although the Minister is not required to table the report. Government guidelines for annual reporting by statutory authorities require that annual reports of all authorities be furnished to the relevant Minister as soon as possible after the end of each financial year but no later than six months after that time and that the Minister table the report within 15 sitting days. Compliance with the guidelines did not occur in the case of GALA's 1983-84 report. The Committee regards annual reporting as an important aspect of accountability. It believes that it is undesirable that the Gaming and Liquor Authority remain without a clear obligation to report on its operations and therefore recommends that the Gaming and Liquor Authority Act be amended to require GALA to furnish an annual report to the Minister. This would then bring the report under the 1983 amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act, which requires reporting within six months. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the qualifications of the financial statements made by the Auditor-General, the Committee is satisfied that the matters have now been resolved so that the qualifications no longer apply. However, a number of matters were noted by the Committee. First, GALA exceeded its powers by investing TAB funds in bank accepted bills of exchange, particularly with banks other than the Commonwealth Bank. This matter was finally remedied in December 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, GALA and the Department of Territories have failed to ensure that a necessary amendment was made to the Poker Machine Ordinance so as to remove doubts about the validity of the Authority's investment policy. It is nine years since the matter was first raised and even now the amendment has still not been made. Thirdly, from 1978 apparently misinterpreted-to put it kindly-ministerial approval was relied upon as the basis for the continued investment of large sums of money. The Committee states that the Authority should have ceased the investment until the necessary powers promised by the then Minister in 1978 were enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, GALA should have in the first instance sought advice on the legal interpretation of its ordinances from the Attorney-General's Department. If that had been done, the dispute over the investment of poker machine moneys would not have arisen. The Committee believes that all authorities should seek advice on statutory interpretation from the Attorney-General's Department, not from private solicitors unless specific and valid circumstances prevent the Department from providing that advice. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Committee notes that GALA's 1984-85 annual report was tabled with only a small delay and that, although the financial statements were again qualified, the qualifications were in respect of the two matters that have now been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that lax administration involving an Australian Capital Territory authority has again led to the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations having to conduct an inquiry and table a report. However, I am pleased that we have helped to ensure that some of the problems have been resolved. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting for lunch, I was debating the Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Bill and I had indicated that the Opposition is in complete agreement with the intention of the legislation, which is to increase the variety of services to the aged in the area of residential accommodation and community services. I commented that Australia has only just scratched the surface as far as community services are concerned and that, apart from meals on wheels, assistance in the home varies considerably. So much of it depends on the local government in the area where a person lives. We could do so much more to help people stay in their homes as long as possible as we know that that is where they want to be. We could help with home cleaning and home maintenance, with small jobs and minor repairs. We could finance ramps instead of steps and hand rails that could assist the elderly to pull themselves up out of baths or showers and thus give them security. We could assist with alarm systems. As I have already indicated, there is considerable worry for the safety of those people. We could help with personal hygiene care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we went around the country we saw that some of the nursing homes have certainly made a commitment in this area. Some of them go to extreme lengths. They send out a bus to collect the elderly from their homes or from local hostels and take them to their day care centre where they are bathed or helped with showers. For the rest of the day they are assisted with activities and entertainment in which they participate, and with general diversional therapy. If we could give that home service, it would be so greatly acceptable not only to the Government coffers, because it would be very much cheaper to keep the elderly in their homes even if we supplied all of the services that I have mentioned, but also to the elderly who, as I have already indicated, want to stay in their homes for as long as possible. Once they are no longer able to do that, the elderly usually move into hostel accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bjelke-Petersen, in her speech, said that many of the church groups have a system whereby the elderly go into hostels, then move into church nursing homes and then into a hospital when they become too ill to stay in the nursing home. In the hostels it is so much easier to supply the services required. The elderly are all in one area so the services for meals, home assistance, the alarm system, the personal care and the activities are so easily able to be carried out. Many of the elderly go on tours around the countryside from the hostels. In general it has become a very acceptable way for the elderly to spend some of their years. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley said that in the past nursing homes have been places to which people have not been very keen to go. They were also places into which many of the elderly were inappropriately placed. That has altered over the years. We now find that the proprietors of nursing homes say that their clientele has changed considerably. No longer are the people who are fairly healthy bedded in their homes; the current residents are more frail and aged than previous residents. However, we must continue to move in that direction. Indeed, the Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes, of which I was a member, brought down a major recommendation that a multi-disciplinary assessment team, comprising the patient's doctor and various other health people, should assess patients before they move into the nursing homes. We also recommended that, having moved into the nursing home, a patient should be reassessed after three months to make sure that the placement has been appropriate. So many people move into nursing homes, and they can be rehabilitated and moved out after a short period. </PARA>
<PARA> We also recommended that all nursing homes should provide some diversional therapy. We also said that they should supply some respite care. If a certain number of beds were set aside in nursing homes, subsidised by the Government, for respite care, I believe that this would be of considerable assistance in keeping the elderly in their own homes. The situation arises so frequently where a daughter, who visits her mother regularly and makes sure that everything is all right for her and that she is in good health, has to go away with the family on a holiday. She ought to be able to do that knowing that when she returns she can again take up the job of looking after her mother. In so many cases, daughters do not consider it a burden to look after their mother in that situation; they consider it a joy. If while the daughter was on holiday the mother could be moved into respite care just for that period, it would assist families to be able to look after their elderly. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second reading speech, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) gave the four basic goals of the legislation. With these goals we certainly agree. The goals are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Aged and disabled people should as far as possible be supported in their own homes, in their own communities. </PARA>
<PARA>I have already spoken about this at length and underlined the importance that the Opposition sees in that. The next goal is:</PARA>
<PARA> Aged and disabled people should be supported by residential services only where other support systems are not appropriate to meet their needs. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, the Opposition would agree wholeheartedly with that. The next goal is:</PARA>
<PARA>Services should be provided in an atmosphere and using processes which promote as far as possible rehabilitation and restoration of function. The manner in which these services are provided should develop and enhance personal freedom and independent functioning of all residents. </PARA>
<PARA>We saw that when we attended some of the nursing homes. Some of them supplied very good rehabilitation services and the residents were able to function very happily in that atmosphere. The fourth goal is:</PARA>
<PARA> Services should be based on a recognition that, for many people, discharge to a residential service providing a less intensive form of care or to a community-based support service will be a possible and desirable outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister then went on to say that if there were to be an emphasis on hostel financing, away from nursing home financing-I underline what Senator Crowley said when she commented that there is no suggestion in the legislation that the number of nursing home beds be decreased-the increase in nursing homes would be governed. So the increase in the number of nursing homes will not be as great as it has been in the past, but the financing will be put into hostel accommodation. In that, the Minister has said that five matters must have consideration. These are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>the requirement for flexible planning, which provides for monitoring, evaluation and changes where necessary, including more integration with community services;</PARA>
<PARA>a publicised and better resourced hostel sector so that hostels can care for increasingly dependent aged people . . . </PARA>
<PARA>At the moment they do not provide for increasingly dependent aged people, and that is an area for which the Government intends to increase finances. Another matter is:</PARA>
<PARA>the extension of residential care services beyond hostels to other forms of accommodation such as group housing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government sees it not only in the area of hostels but also in group housing arrangements. The next matter is:</PARA>
<PARA>the expansion of community services to assist those elderly people most at risk of premature and inappropriate institutionalisation. </PARA>
<PARA>The last matter is the importance of carefully developing a process of assessment so that it will gain support from consumers-that is, the elderly-the professionals, who look after them, and the service providers. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation covers only a couple of those areas. There are several areas that have not been approached by the Government in this legislation, and I dare say that it hopes to move to those areas in the future. This was referred to by Senator Giles when she spoke of the inappropriate placing of so many of our young in nursing homes. As we went around, we found the results of many car crashes. The young, because of their disabilities, have been placed in nursing homes. This was most inappropriate. We found young, mentally alert people in wheel-chairs or with various forms of disability, unable to communicate with people of their own age, unable to undertake the activities that would be appropriate for them, and surrounded by elderly people. We really must move in the direction of giving them an opportunity of being placed in appropriate care. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Committee's recommendation was that nursing homes specifically for young people be moved from the nursing home program to a more appropriate scheme-for example, the handicapped persons assistance program. I know that that would be a very expensive way of going about this matter, but we viewed one very successful scheme under which the young were all in one very large house. Each had his or her independent bedroom, and they moved around and socialised together. That was most appropriate. They all seemed fairly happy there. Some were able to go home at weekends, where their wife or husband, as the case may be, could tend to them for just that weekend, and then they would return to the home arrangement. We must work in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area that has not been fully examined and one which needs appropriate action is that of the confused and psychiatric patient. So many nursing homes are unable to supply proper facilities for this group of people. So many criticisms are levelled against nursing homes because the patient has to be tied, either in a chair beside the bed or in the bed. In many cases this criticism is most unjustified because there is no other way that the nursing home could possibly keep a confused or psychiatric patient away from harm. Indeed, if proper facilities are not available, there is often no alternative, because the majority of such patients will wander at large, either out on to the road, where he or she may get run over, or into areas that are most dangerous for such people. We did see some very appropriate and very nice nursing homes with large gardens and walled areas where the psychiatric or confused patients were able to wander, and they appeared to be very happy in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The third group that I believe we should be looking at in a more compassionate way is the ethnic elderly. We were told that when the ethnic elderly become aged they move back to their original customs, even though they may have been successfully integrated into the Australian community until then. They want their ethnic meals and they revert to their original language. We were told that it was most appropriate in those instances for nurses at least to be able to translate the language used and that these elderly people should be able to get the type of meals they want. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume has spoken about the amendments the Opposition will put forward. As I have already said, the Opposition agrees entirely with the legislation before the Senate. The proposed amendments are designed to give the Parliament more scrutiny and control, rather than relying entirely on ministerial power. I believe that the Government will agree with this proposition. I am sure that the Minister for Community Services (Senator Grimes) would not want to have the power unto himself; I am sure he would be far happier with parliamentary scrutiny. I believe he will accept at least some of the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extremely pleasing for me to join in a debate where there is general agreement by all parties in the Parliament, where the Government and the Opposition can come together for the good of one section of the community. It is even more pleasing for me when that section of the community is the aged. It is, as it should be, a situation where both sides of the Parliament have joined to enable our elderly as far as possible to be supported in their own homes and in their own communities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems that all parties agree that the Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Bill is a congenial one, and we will be happy to see it passed. It certainly represents a step in the right direction. When this Government takes a step such as this I wonder whether it has not lost its way! Be that as it may, we had better grasp this legislation while we can. It represents another chapter in the saga of the Federal Government wrestling with the nursing homes monster that it created many years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I happen to have been in medical practice before the Federal Government decided to help the nursing home industry. In those days it was a congenial part of medical practice. There were a few large nursing homes run by the religious and charitable institutions but there were many more small nursing homes scattered throughout the suburbs of the big cities and in the towns around the country. Most of the people were looked after at home. It was just after the war and there was a tremendous amount of community goodwill in those days. Service groups such as the Rotary clubs, the Australian Jaycees, various guilds and Meals on Wheels used to help people looking after others who needed nursing home care in their homes. There was no shortage of beds. When a doctor was out visiting a patient he and the family could see when the time a patient would need nursing home care was approaching. They could pick which nursing home had the facilities and the various therapies available for that particular patient, get in touch with the matron or the sister in charge and then the matron or the sister would visit the patient with the doctor, talk to the family and see whether the one suited the other. </PARA>
<PARA> We did not need any assessment teams such as the Government is introducing now, at an initial cost of something like $16.5m, to make sure that a low cost patient is not in a high cost bed. Back in those days the assessment team was the family, the patient, the doctor and the sister in charge of the nursing home. It was all done as part of looking after the patient and, when the time came, the patient went into the nursing home. That arrangement meant that patients were living in a nursing home that was rather similar to the home they had come from. They were near their relatives for ease of visiting during visiting hours. They could be visited by grandchildren, if they wanted, and if they were well enough they could have outings. They could be taken to church or shopping, or just for a drive. The patients could take family portraits and even articles of their own furniture and things that they felt more comfortable with into the homes. Any sloppy service was very quickly picked up by the staff, the visiting doctor, the family or the patient. There was no need for myriad inspectors. In those days any faults with feeding, bathing or nursing were quickly picked up and amicably rectified. I do not recall a lot of problems. Undoubtedly there was some variation in the quality of the nursing homes, but nothing like the variations that have been disclosed by the report of the Senator Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes, which I think are a direct result of the government assistance given to nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government decided to intervene, in about the middle of the 1950s, and the method it chose was open-ended funding for nursing homes. Of course once open-ended funding was introduced there was an immediate proliferation of nursing homes throughout the country. It became one of the biggest and best businesses in the country and it was not long before the Government realised that it had created an open-ended financial monster. Inevitably on came the Government restrictions, controls and regulations that dictated what type of buildings could be used as nursing homes, their siting, what sort of staffing they would have, their staff-patient ratios and what fees they would charge. Accreditation was brought it. There were a whole lot of terms and conditions that increased costs above even their existing level. </PARA>
<PARA> The licensing of nursing homes was removed from the field of State governments because of the open-ended funding, and joint Federal-State licensing teams were formed which allocated beds on a population ration basis. Naturally they had a very slow turnover and could not pick where new beds or extensions to homes were required, and dislocations started to appear. Hostels started to appear as a means of providing cheaper care, respite care appeared, independent living units appeared, home help appeared. In the days before the Government stepped in the flow of patients was naturally from their own homes, where most of them were looked after, to an independent living unit or a hostel if it was available, to a nursing home and then to a hospital. Of course, once the Government stepped in with open-ended funding all the people wanted to go to nursing homes and hospitals because that is where they got the greatest rebate for their medical insurance. So there was a glut at that end. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole thrust of this legislation is to reverse the patient flow to take them out of the high cost end of hospitals and nursing homes and encourage them, using the financial incentive, back into the hostels, the independent living units and their own homes. A vast range of community home care is envisaged to help this flow of patients back to their own homes. Of course, that is the right direction, but that is where they all were in the first place, before the Government tried to assist nursing home patients. Honourable senators have mentioned in this debate that the problem has been the government subsidy. Of course, government subsidy means government control. As I have explained, dislocations occur where we get the low cost patient in the high cost bed and where we do not have the development of the industry that we should have. We have heard mentioned in the debate this afternoon that young people who have been disabled have not been looked after, that old, mentally deranged people do not have facilities available to them; but that is all because those parts of the industry were not allowed to develop as a result of the types of nursing homes that developed under the open-ended funding. Had the industry been left alone I am sure that by now those areas would have been adequately catered for. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the government controls were imposed, the dislocations occurred, costs went up, and restrictions were imposed. Right at this moment many nursing homes are in need of extensions and many areas could do with more nursing homes, particularly in my own area in south-east Queensland. On the Gold Coast where I live there is a need for extensions and additions to nursing homes. Of course, with the Government committee deciding now many beds will go where, it is all taking too long and often it is not being decided. This Bill, in particular, will put restrictions on the numbers of nursing home beds that will be allowed in the future simply because the Government is subsidising them. I know of nursing homes that would be quite prepared to put on any extension that is necessary, and put patients in there and not receive a subsidy for them but they cannot do that because once a nursing home bed is recognised and registered it attracts a subsidy and it has to have the subsidy. So the Government refuses these nursing homes extensions or additions, and it even refuses to allow new nursing homes. One of the easiest ways out of the problem would be for the Government to allow nursing homes to make additions or extensions and allow new nursing homes that do not attract a subsidy at all, in order to get us back to where we were. Local needs change. Quite often they change rapidly, particularly in a State such as Queensland, which is decentralised and has new towns appearing in mining areas, for example. They need the facility of nursing home care so that younger people can have their parents or grandparents with them when they go to isolated areas. By the time the Minister for Community Services (Senator Grimes) gets around to making a decree the need will probably be over, or it will be very desperate. </PARA>
<PARA> With any luck this legislation will mean a reduction in real terms in the government subsidy to nursing homes. In other words, there will be a bigger gap between the fee charged and the subsidy the Government pays. It may sound a little callous and harsh, but every step we retreat from the government subsidy is a step in the right direction and it will be better for all of us. It is just a pity that the Government does not reduce personal income tax by the amount of money it will save with this Bill. All the talk we have heard about tax reductions under this Government has been only rhetoric. Taxes are higher and money is being taken away from the people, so it will be more difficult for them to manage. Nevertheless, this is still a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> It is cruel to decrease services and increase taxes. If the Government would reduce personal income tax so that people could better afford private care that would take an enormous load off the Government. I liken this step to the Government removing the subsidy to private hospitals. Some $140m a year has just been removed from the private hospitals. I actually see that as a good step. I think the Government was probably trying to drive patients out of the private hospitals and have them all go to public hospitals, but because the private hospitals are now not subject to receiving the Government subsidy it will lead to a freer and better type of private hospital care and I think we will see an upsurge in private hospital care in Australia that is freed from the thraldom of government. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two main purposes of the Bill. The first one is the grants for capital works-grants up to the full amount of the capital cost of buildings for aged or disabled persons, so long as the grants are used exclusively to finance disabled groups. The second purpose I have been talking about is the new growth control of nursing home beds. As has been mentioned, we want to move some amendments to the Bill. These amendments were discussed by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and I understand that they have been discussed with the Minister. With any luck he will be amenable to those amendments, particularly as there is obviously no provision for a review of a departmental secretary's decision on whether a nursing home facility is necessary for a disadvantaged group. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I want to leave with the Minister-I would like to have it answered if possible-is that thought be given to allowing the construction of new beds which do not attract a subsidy from the Government. I think that would be a major step that could help to relieve a lot of the problems of the nursing home industry in Australia today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall not speak at great length on the Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Bill, which is before the Senate, because the Opposition is supporting it. Other senators have spoken to this Bill, but I wish to refer to some aspects as they affect the Australian Capital Territory. I have spoken previously about some of these matters. I have told the Senate that there are over 240 citizens in the Australian Capital Territory who have been classified as being in need of nursing home beds but who are on a waiting list and are not able to obtain them. It is necessary to remember that this is the case while we talk about other forms of care. The home and community care program enables people to remain in their own homes for a longer time. For many that is desirable, it is what they want, and undoubtedly it is the cheapest way of caring for a person. Of course, there are some who eventually get to the stage where they are not able to care for themselves. In some instances, to leave them alone and merely give attention periodically leaves them in a totally isolated situation. They are merely existing in their own homes without really being able to enjoy life at all or get any assistance towards rehabilitation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also recognise that the concept of developing more hostels meets some of the need. In fact, I think a lot of people would welcome the opportunity to live in a hostel environment where they have the opportunity to mix with others and enjoy the life that can be obtained from having more people around them. That still does not address the fact that there are people who require nursing home care eventually, and they are not all the frail aged. Earlier in the debate we heard about those younger people who for various reasons fall into the category of needing the quite intensive care that comes with nursing home care. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the Nursing Homes and Hostels Review report which was prepared by the Department of Community Services and which was tabled in, I think, April this year. It refers in a couple of places to the Territory. In one part, in reference to numbers of people, there is the statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The rate of increase will be fairly stable in all States, while the two Territories-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory-</PARA>
<PARA>will experience a more rapid increase in the numbers of the aged. </PARA>
<PARA>That would lead me to conclude that the present number of 240 people who are waiting for nursing home beds in the Australian Capital Territory will grow if this report is correct. The report also gives details of the overall placements and bed provision. There we see that presently, on the basis of number of beds per thousand people over the age of 70, the rate in the Australian Capital Territory is much lower than in other States and Territories-57.9 per cent for nursing homes and 33.2 per cent for hostels. </PARA>
<PARA> I endorse the comments made by Senator Sheil that the present system, whereby the granting of a licence for nursing home beds must attract a subsidy, needs to be reviewed and that nexus needs to be broken so that there can be a place for private nursing home beds which do not attract a subsidy. There may not be call for a great many of them, but I think there would be call for some which would be occupied and which would take the pressure away from the number of beds which presently attract a subsidy. I think that needs to be looked into. I also question whether the present cost, alleged to be about $20,000 per nursing home bed on an annual basis, is realistic or whether savings could be made in that area. While there are subsidies the cost is likely to be higher than it ought to be. </PARA>
<PARA> The report on which I have referred also indicates that, on present indications, by the year 1996 the Australian Capital Territory will need an additional 848 nursing home beds. Under the proposal that the Minister for Community Services (Senator Grimes) announced recently, the Australian Capital Territory will get an additional 180 hostel beds but only 20 nursing home beds between now and 1989. I think that is fairly dismal news for the families who are worried and concerned about the welfare of the frail aged to whom I have referred as being presently in need of nursing home accommodation but who cannot get it. In addition to the 240 who are waiting, I would say that 40 or more in our hospitals need nursing home beds. They do not really need hospital accommodation, but they are not able to obtain the nursing home beds that they need. When the situation becomes desperate in Canberra, as it is at present, it is necessary to look to New South Wales. Some of the elderly people from this Territory have been taken to Eden, Pambula, Sydney and beyond. This is almost inhuman in terms of the stress under which it puts the aged person and the stress for the families who have to make arrangements to send elderly relatives so far away from them. It is difficult for them to visit. It is certainly unsettling for an elderly person to have to adjust to being removed from his or her family in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> I could spend the rest of the afternoon recounting stories, which I have heard in my electorate office, of people who suddenly need nursing home beds but who are not able to get them. It can happen quite suddenly. An elderly person who has managed to live by himself or herself for a considerable time, with support from family or perhaps from Meals on Wheels and the other services which are provided, may have an accident or fall-it particularly happens to elderly women who may break bones-and may no longer be able to live in that way and may require a nursing home bed. In Canberra, even a hostel bed is hard to come by. I have the figures for the beds that are available. There are 126 at Jindalee Nursing Home; 128 at Allambee Nursing Home; beds in the hospitals are being used as nursing home beds; there are 126 private nursing home beds and 335 hostel beds. On the evidence that we have as to the needs of this community, they are well short of the numbers that are required. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have beds available for people to convalesce. We do not have beds available for respite care. If older people who need to convalesce are sent home and are living by themselves, it frequently means that they will be back in hospital before too long because they are not able to cope. It is a vicious circle of having a shortage of hospital beds in Canberra so that people cannot be kept in them for as long as they require and not having enough nursing home beds either. One way or another, as a community we have an obligation to look after our elderly and those who are sick and cannot fully care for themselves. I suggest that at present we are not doing it properly. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem from this report of the Department of Community Services that, in addition to the 200 extra beds that the Minister has announced, we will need another 648 in the seven-year period to 1996. I do not think I would be unreasonable if I expressed some pessimism about whether they will be available, but I say that they must be available. In the Australian Capital Territory we have in hospital beds and nursing home beds people who have come here from other places because their families are here. I believe there is a distortion in the figures because of that. It is my view that we are not adequately providing at present for people who need this sort of care in this community. I welcome the move that is made in this legislation. As I said, the Opposition is supporting it. I take the opportunity to refer specifically to the problems that exist in my electorate, and I hope they will be addressed before too long. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer also to the scrutiny of Bills report which has been referred to. I hope the Minister will deal with the matters that have been raised within that report because I think they are important issues as to the discretion conferred on the secretary. In relation to a number of sections the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills refers to the lack of parliamentary scrutiny. The Committee reported to the Senate that it recognises that it is the view of the Administrative Review Council that decisions which involve apportioning of finite resources are not appropriate for review on the merits, but it also goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless the Committee draws clauses 19 and 32 to the attention of Senators in that they may be considered to make rights, liberties and/or obligations unduly dependent upon non-reviewable administrative decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>I think these observations of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee ought to be dealt with by the Government, and I hope the Minister will do this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their thoughtful contributions to this debate on the Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Bill 1986. This area of nursing homes, hostels, accommodation and care for the aged generally is not an easy one. It is one with which governments in this country have been grappling since, I suppose, the Second World War. It is an interesting situation in that so many people have so many firm views on the subject and so many people have views on the subject which are just not right. I will refer, not in any critical way, to what the last two speakers said. Both Senator Sheil and Senator Reid referred to the possibility that nursing homes could be built without subsidy and that maybe this would be a solution to the problem. There is nothing--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Reid" NAMEID="VI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator Reid</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We did not say it was a solution. It may help, in part, by providing some beds, not nursing homes. You are misinterpreting what we said.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, but the honourable senator has misheard what I said. I said that she and Senator Sheil suggested that part of the problem may be solved by providing nursing home beds without subsidy. Senator Sheil, at least, and, I thought, Senator Reid asked: Why is that not possible? My response to that is: It is perfectly possible. There is nothing in the world to stop anyone building a nursing home and filling it with people without Commonwealth subsidy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Reid" NAMEID="VI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator Reid</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have to be licensed, and that attracts a subsidy.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The licensing authorities are the State governments. In the Australian Capital Territory certainly it involves the Federal Government. Senator Sheil is quite wrong. There is nothing to stop people doing that. There is nothing that the Commonwealth would want to do to stop people doing that. If people want to build nursing homes without subsidy, they can. If they want to run them without subsidy, they can. The licensing authorities, I am sure, in many of the States would be only too happy for them to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, we have in this country a problem, which Senator Reid, I think, touched on, of a very high percentage of nursing home beds for the elderly population. We have a maldistribution of nursing home beds, I am the first to admit, which we have been trying to correct. In the past nursing homes in, say, the big conurbations of Sydney and Melbourne tended to be built in the eastern suburbs where there were appropriate old homes and mansions, but the people tended to be in the western suburbs where there were not the mansions et cetera which could be converted into nursing homes. Only in recent times has there been a better distribution of nursing home beds. Also, under the legislation previously in place, people tended to build nursing homes rather than hostels because of the increased amounts of subsidy they could get for nursing homes and people tended to believe that the only alternative to staying in one's home, when elderly, was to go into a nursing home. In this country people tended to believe that nursing homes were the only alternative form of accommodation. As the Nursing Homes and Hostels Review pointed out, and as various organisations in the area have pointed out for many years, to concentrate on building the most expensive and the most dependent form of care accommodation for the aged and not to concentrate on the provision of services or on the provision of hostels or less dependent accommodation led to the distortion we have. </PARA>
<PARA> All governments with good faith and all parties involved in government or potentially in government in this country have been taking a conscientious approach to this very real difficulty. Senator Peter Baume, Senator Walters, Senator Powell and Senator Bjelke-Petersen-I think every speaker-made the very valid point, which I agree with, that there is a need for more home and community services if we are to provide less of this more dependent form of accommodation. We certainly agree with that. We have an agreed plan, as is known, I think, with the State governments to develop more home and community care services. In the last Budget we announced further home and community care funding totalling $94m over four years to further increase growth in home and community care services. We have had very good examples in some isolated situations where this can be extremely effective. I know of one city in Victoria where nine years ago there was a 40-bed nursing home with a waiting list of 150. For reasons which obviously involved people thinking way ahead of their time, instead of succumbing to the pressure to build more nursing home beds that community built a hostel, provided more independent-type accommodation, and, what is more important, provided community-based home and community care services. Now, nine years later, that community has a 40-bed nursing home, as it had before, and a waiting list of nil. The temptation in those days was to double or even treble the size of the nursing home to overcome an apparent lack of nursing home beds in that area. In fact, the problem was solved in a much more socially and economically acceptable way by providing that mix of services which resulted in the nursing home of 40 beds nine years ago being a perfectly satisfactory level of nursing home beds in that town. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week I was in Scone in New South Wales, a very enlightened and small community which, over the last few years, has provided independent-type units scattered throughout the town, a nursing home and a hostel and which now has facilities worth something like $4m of which that relatively small town provided $2m-worth. That town has a very satisfactory care of the aged program and is doing it in an economical way and in a way of which the town is very proud and of which anyone in the community would be very proud. All these things are possible. They would not be possible if we proceeded down the track we were proceeding down in the past whereby the number of nursing home beds was increasing rapidly, the cost per bed to the taxpayer was rising at something like twice the rate of average weekly earnings and we were facing in the long run a situation in which the community would have great difficulty supporting this relatively unsatisfactory form of care. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell noted that the Bill provides for two elements, improved planning and improved hostel growth and said that, with these two elements of the Government's announced five-point residential care reform strategy, we also have to address the other three elements-expanded assessment, greater flexibility in the provision of accommodation and further HACC expansion. I have said that we agree with the further expansion of home and community care. We agree also with the need for better assessment. In fact, in the last Budget we provided an increase from $4m to anticipated expenditure of $13m in 1988-89 for geriatric assessment. This assessment does not mean just a gate-keeping role to keep people out of this dependent nursing home accommodation. What it means is assessing people's needs so that they have a better idea of the choices they have in their retirement and the choices available to them in the community to ensure that they get the care which is appropriate to their needs and which maintains their independence and their dignity as individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> If people's view is that the only choice they have is to stay at home or to go into an expensive, dependent-making nursing home, that is what they will think of. If they are afraid that some day they may need to go into a nursing home and that the best thing for them to do is to put their names on a waiting list for fear that when they get sick five or 10 years down the track they will need to go into a nursing home, we get a distorted picture of nursing home waiting lists. That is what happens now. When we send out geriatric assessment teams and they are working satisfactorily and talking to people who are on nursing home waiting lists, the very first thing that happens is that those nursing home waiting lists go down. We find on them people who should not be on them. We find people on them who do not know that there are alternatives for them in the future. We are meeting now with State governments, with consumers and with provider professional and union bodies to help to plan the expansion of the geriatric assessment program. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also acting on several fronts to develop greater flexibility in the type of accommodation in which care can be provided, again to get away from this obsession with nursing homes. We have discussions with State housing authorities, who in some States are providing group housing and making houses available to organisations which are looking at innovative forms of accommodation for the aged. We have funded the Abbeyfield organisation-in fact, I opened the first Abbeyfield house in Victoria recently-which is encouraging the promotion of small scale community models, in this case in two houses specially modified for the individuals involved. We are providing information and assisting service providers to look at concepts such as hostels without walls and at providing services in small community groups so that people can stay in their own homes or in independent units and retain that independence they want. </PARA>
<PARA> We are trying to expand the range of special services to meet the needs of special groups. There was a meeting today with the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled to develop plans for special services for the aged with special disabilities-the blind and the deaf. We have proposals to improve services to the ethnic aged, following the release of the ethnic aged working party report which I received today. We had meetings in all States with the ethnic community councils to improve the services to the ethnic aged, a problem which is becoming increasingly apparent to all of us as the percentage of ethnic people, people born outside Australia, in the over 65 age group increases in this country. We expect a threefold increase in funding this year to provide special dementia care in hostels, taking it to a level of about $1.5m, because as this population ages the biggest percentage increase in the aged will be in those over 80. It is in that group that we get the higher percentages of people with dementia or afflictions which cause them to need the special nursing care that we will have to provide. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to ensure that the bed provision is adequate. Several honourable senators raised the issue of needs based planning. Senator Powell, I think, expressed concern that nursing home bed numbers would be reduced or that nursing home bed provision would not be adequate. I must make this point in response to a point that was made by Senator Peter Baume in his speech in the second reading debate: There will be no reduction in nursing home beds. In fact, we will need more nursing home beds between now and the year 2010. What we do need, though, is a curb on the future growth of nursing homes so that the ratio of nursing home beds to the aged population will fall. But this will be offset by an increase in the ratio of hostel beds to the aged people in our community. Better assessment-by which I mean, necessarily, a better knowledge by elderly people and their relatives of the choices-will mean that pressure will be taken off nursing homes by avoiding inappropriate admissions to nursing homes, a problem which has been known and which has been mentioned in every report that has been put down inside and outside this Parliament in the last 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA> This problem of people inappropriately in nursing homes because there is nowhere else for them is a problem which has bedevilled us. Also, as Senator Reid mentioned, there is the problem of people being inappropriately in acute care hospital beds because no one else has a place for them. These people cause a blockage for the entry of elderly people into nursing homes. We have a consultancy on needs based planning which is nearing completion and which will guide future planning arrangements. The advisory committees which will be appointed will ensure proper sensitivity to consumer and other local needs in the planning process. The existing planning process tends to be a reactive one, but we need to take into account the very factors that Senator Reid talked about, such as the fact that in the Australian Capital Territory people tend to come into the area from outside to retire and be with relatives and later look for nursing homes. We want to take this into account. Unlike the existing nursing home legislation, this Bill will provide flexibility to meet actual and identifiable needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bjelke-Petersen made the very valid point that there is no point in our providing more hostels and providing them with adequate funding if they are going to become de facto nursing homes as the residents become more and more dependent. I agree entirely with that very real concern of Senator Bjelke-Petersen's. Hostels should not become de facto nursing homes with all the trappings of institutionalisation such as acute medical care, thereby becoming the pseudo hospitals that so many nursing homes become. Hostels are able to provide a better lifestyle for people and it is in the interests of the aged to enter them rather than nursing homes when they can no longer stay at home, because they can maintain independence and a much freer and more natural and sensible lifestyle. It may be that in the future we have to look at providing extra funding, even more than we do now, for those people who become a bit frail in nursing homes, because I think the concept of people gradually moving from one place to the other as they become more and more frail is not necessarily a good one. But the fact of the matter is that only about 7 per cent of the people in our community ever end up in a nursing home or a hostel. Most people do not go near them. There is not this transition of the whole mass of the population from home to hostel to nursing homes. There never was, there is not now and there will not be in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that some hostels will have to change their functions now. We know that there will be, compared to now, some increased dependency of people in hostels, and we recognise this by increasing the personal care subsidies in the Bill and in fact indexing payments of this type. We need to provide services to those people in hostels to ensure that they are not dumped there, ending up in the situation about which Senator Bjelke-Petersen expressed concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell welcomed the widening of options for the aged. At the same time she cautioned against reduction in expenditure on aged services. In the Budget the Government announced the strategy of redistributing the resources for care of the aged people away from nursing homes to hostel and community care and committed itself to an extra expenditure of roughly $24m in 1986-87, $80m in 1987-88 and $150m in 1989 on these initiatives. In addition, there are increases in the funding provided for ongoing services. The residential care appropriations in 1986-87 are to total something like $1.2 billion, which is an increase of about $86m or $90m, I think, on last year's expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> This is, as I said, a complex and difficult area. It is one we are grappling with. It is one which I believe this legislation will enable us to grapple with much better than we could in the past. There are many myths surrounding the provision of aged people's accommodation in this country. Among them is the myth that people who go to nursing homes should go in there, stay there, die there and never come out. Hence people tend to burn their bridges. There should be a rehabilitative function in nursing homes. People do go into nursing homes and, with a bit of care and attention, improve. They have the capacity to come out and they should come out. Some poignant literature has been written on this matter in recent times. There are those who believe that we should return to the far gone days in this country when people stayed with their relatives all their lives. In fact, surveys have shown, and the paper `The Greying of Australia' has demonstrated, that there never was a time in this country's history when a majority of people in fact stayed at home with their children and their relatives. Most people did in fact lead and live independent lives and will do so in the future-even with the aging of the population and more people reaching those ages. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Reid mentioned, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills had some concerns with aspects of the legislation. I, in fact, have written to the Chairman of that Committee, Senator Tate, answering, I believe, some of those concerns. Most of those concerns are taken up by Senator Peter Baume in his amendments, particularly the concerns about non- reviewable decisions and the lack of parliamentary scrutiny, which were raised by Senator Reid. I think probably those matters are best dealt with at the Committee stage, particularly when we deal with the matters raised by Senator Peter Baume in his amendments. I have been trying to speak to Senator Peter Baume since the second reading debate began today. He intimated to me that we certainly would be able to come to a compromise on some of his amendments. I am certainly happy to do that. With that in mind, I have in fact produced some Government amendments which are alternatives to the Opposition amendments which have been circulated and I will circulate them. Again they are the best dealt with in Committee, when I hope we can sort them out. I think the compromise amendments are reasonable and will be acceptable to the Opposition, as Opposition members will see in debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank honourable senators for their contributions and co-operation. This is an important area. These legislative changes are crucial to the sensible development of care for the aged in our community and I hope they will be welcomed by the majority of the community. I know that some people have done pretty well out of the existing system and are uneasy about changes. The simple fact is that it has been recognised for some years by governments of both political parties, by operators of nursing homes, and by organisations who represent the aged, that it is impossible for this community to go on in the way it has in the past. We have carefully considered the recommendations of the committees that have looked at this problem for the last decade. We have considered the representations that have been made to us by parliamentarians and by those involved in the industry and we believe that we have come up with legislation that will not be perfect, as no legislation ever is, but at least sets down the rules of the game. It is up to those of us who are playing the game at government level and industry level to ensure that the game advances and that we reach the sorts of goals we are looking for. I urge honourable senators to support the legislation. I understand from a note passed to me by the Opposition Whip that Senator Peter Baume is unavoidably delayed. Therefore, I suggest that after the second reading vote, it may be sensible to adjourn the debate until he is available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate was adjourned, I was part of the way through my speech on these Appropriation Bills. Perhaps I should turn my attention to the question of taxation, which has been the meat of this parliamentary session, and no doubt will continue to be. The great debate is about tax, who should pay it and at what rates. Again and again, it is proposed by the Opposition that in some way people will pay more tax at their income level than they did previously. Although it has already been said, notably by Senator Maguire in his many excellent speeches in this chamber, it is worth repeating that since this Government came into office there has been a downward trend in the rates at which tax is levied on people earning income in this community. The first was in November 1984, when those on lower incomes had their rates of income tax reduced from 30 per cent to 25 per cent. By way of the further tax cuts, that will be reduced by one per cent to 24 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next lot of tax cuts will come into operation on 1 December this year, and again at the risk of being repetitious I point out that it is important to realise what will happen then. The maximum tax rate anybody will pay, no matter what he earns, will be 49c, whereas when this Government came into power the maximum rate was 60c, and that looked like continuing. In addition, there will be an increase in the threshold of the amount of money people can earn before they have to pay tax. That will happen from 1 December 1986, when the tax free threshold will be lifted from its present level of $4,595 to $4,890, and from 1 July 1987, when it will be lifted to $5,100. There has been a rearrangement of the tax scales so that everybody who pays income tax will now have to pay at a lower percentage rate than was the situation before this Government came into office. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxes have been imposed which were not imposed before. The classic is one that has common currency overseas, and that is the capital gains tax. That was applied to assets acquired after midnight on 19 September 1985. At the time it was imposed it was said that disaster would follow, and that is still being said. Well, if that disaster has happened or is about to happen, I point out that the Australian sharemarket does not seem to understand that. As was pointed out in the Sydney Morning Herald on 5 November 1986-I think Senator Maguire has already dealt with this in his address-`Market hits 42nd record this year'. The following passage appears in the body of the article under that headline:</PARA>
<PARA> The market's breathless 86 per cent bull run over the past 18 months has some pundits such as EquitiLink executive directors Laurence Freedman and Brian Sherman saying the market is in an unstoppable phase. </PARA>

Predictions of disaster have continued, but it has not happened. I simply use the capital gains tax as an illustration of what I am saying. The capital gains tax was imposed over a year ago on assets acquired after 19 September 1985, and Senator Messner predicted-it was his honest belief-that disaster would follow. However, that disaster seems to have had a short life span because at the moment the market is going at an all time high.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Messner puts forward his explanation, but I am saying that the figures and the article to which I drew attention show that people still have great confidence in the market-so much so that they are buying scrip at record levels. Senator Messner says that there is another explanation for that, but if he examines the evidence of what has occurred, he will see that what I have said is correct. If Senator Messner's predictions were right, the price should have fallen. Let us take the abolition of the entertainment deduction. Again that was predicted to bring disaster and that has not happened. Somebody has to pay tax, and this point is worth repeating. In order to carry on a civilised society in which people, hopefully, get some sort of return from the society in which they live and to which they contribute, a government needs taxes. This argument is really not about whether tax should be imposed, but who should pay that tax. I quoted some figures earlier in the day which showed that many of our top companies are not paying their share of taxation. When Opposition members make protests about the tax burden being too great, whom are they defending? Are they defending the family man? Are they talking about the man who has a wife at home and two, three, four or five children? Are we talking about saving him from the incidence of taxation or are we talking about saving big companies? If one looks at the article in the Sydney Morning Herald of Wednesday, 29 October, to which I referred earlier, one sees that John Elliott's Elders-IXL paid 10.35 per cent by way of income tax in the period mentioned in the article, which was the last financial year. John Spalvins's David Jones paid 10.75 per cent and Alan Bond's Bond Corporation paid 13.95 per cent. When people talk about the heavy incidence of taxation, who do they think is affected by it? Certainly, the person who goes out into the work force, earns his money and brings it home to keep his wife and family-and much was made about this sort of person earlier in the day-is paying tax to enable the big companies to pay the sorts of rates of tax that I have just mentioned here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is right and proper that the tax burden be redistributed so that people who can properly afford to pay the tax do so. It is in that context that the much-debated fringe benefits tax has been brought in. There has been a great controversy, tumult and shouting about the fringe benefits tax. But those who have made all the fuss have never been able to detract from that fundamental point of principle that those who earn big incomes, partly in cash and partly in terms of free houses, free cars, free school fees and what have you, should be made to contribute some part of that benefit towards those who do not have such benefits and have to pay income tax at a much higher level than they otherwise would if everybody paid his tax. If everybody paid his tax, the sorts of problems that we have now would not be with us. </PARA>
<PARA> One answer that is put to that argument is that we must encourage enterprise. I wish to a say a few words about that. Of course enterprise must be encouraged, but it must be encouraged correctly. Again and again Opposition members seem to be saying that the people who pay the level of tax that this Government will soon reduce should not only continue to pay it, but should also take a cut in their incomes in order to make the country more competitive. If we analyse the competitiveness of this country simply in terms of wage levels, we will not get out of our present difficulties. The problems we have with the sorts of goods that we produce are not simply created by the level of our wages. That is not so in any particular case. We must make an analysis-and this has been done by our redoubted leader, Senator Button, over the years-to ascertain sensibly how our industries have been developing and whether they have been developing with the necessary initiative, drive and attention to technology. If they have not, some encouragement should be give to them and some demands made upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> In my closing few minutes I wish to say something about industrial relations policy. If this country is to go forward and develop as it should, if this country is to get out of its present economic problems and the social problems that may flow from them, it must do so on a co-operative basis and all sections-those who manage, those who work and those who provide capital for the industries which give us an income-should co-operate. Behind the accord, whether it be mark 1, mark 2 or the proposed mark 3, that concept reigns. This is the one way forward. That co-operation and ability to work together will see us through the present situation. Co-operation will not come if the Opposition makes continual attacks on the unions, on the Australian Council of Trade Unions and upon those organisations and instruments which represent the vast majority of workers in this country. The recipe that has been put forward in the Opposition's industrial policy-I believe that certain aspects of it were launched yesterday-is a recipe for conflict, disaster and a lowering of the incomes that we can earn. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Appropriation Bills and as these Bills authorise the Government's finances for the current year, it gives us an opportunity to review briefly the Government's Budget strategy and to look at it in an overall context. The first point that must be made about the Government's Budget strategy is that there is no real strategy at all. This Budget represents an attempt to kowtow to international money markets. It is based on the fact that we must screw the economy down as the only way to solve our balance of payments problem. This is a point of view that the Australian Democrats absolutely reject. There are other approaches, there are imaginative ways of solving our balance of payments problem, which is the essential problem in our community and this has not been addressed in this Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tragedy from Australia's point of view is that there has emerged a consensus between the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party of Australia. The policies of both those parties on how the economy should be managed are identical. We now have two parties in this country-the `Liborals' and the Democrats. The Democrats stand alone as a small party putting forward an alternative method of managing the economy and we are doing it against the two major parties which have combined. Time and time again we have seen during the Budget debates that the Government's Budget Bills have been passed with the support of the Liberal and National parties. The Democrats have moved constructive amendments and these have been voted down by the Liborals, by the coalition of the two major parties. Thus, the alternative is not really being put to the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take this opportunity to point out that there is an alternative. It is critical that this alternative be discussed in the community and at least acted on in some important areas. There is no fundamental strategy. The first thing that we could have seen in this Budget was a long term indicative plan over a period of three or five years that would have allowed us to move the economy in a new direction. No such long term indicative plan has come forward. The plan should have stated: `We will have growth of 2 1/2 or 3 per cent. If that growth pattern is to emerge, we have to tackle the export problem. This means that we have to have a rapid development of our manufacturing industries and to buy less from overseas'. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential problem is that we are spending money that we do not have. Nothing has really been done to stop the haemorrhaging of Australia's hard-earned foreign exchange. What can we do about that? There are various approaches. The first thing is that there seems to be around in the community an attitude that Australia must borrow money overseas and that, if it does not do that, it cannot continue to function. This is an attitude that does not have very much substance when we look at the facts. The fact is that 90 per cent of the capital that has gone into developing Australia over the last 30 years is Australian. Unfortunately, that 90 per cent Australian capital has gone into developing our infrastructure, into building roads and building houses, and the 10 per cent foreign money has been directed at taking over our wealth-producing industries, our manufacturing industries, our farming and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> If we had a long term indicative plan, it would be possible over a period of five years for Australia to develop its resources without the hang-up that we must continue to borrow money. The fact is that we cannot afford to borrow money anyway. That has been the policy in the last 30 years and we are now in the position that we cannot meet the interest payments on the money that we have borrowed. If we cannot meet the interest payments on the money that we have borrowed, why do we keep borrowing? A family has to face such facts sooner or later. This country has to face the fact that our credit is running out. If our credit is running out, we have to turn around and look at our internal resources. That means that we have to spend less and earn more. We have to get a long term plan that brings those two fundamental approaches into some real economic strategy. Until we do that, I am afraid that Australia runs the risk of becoming bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has given lip-service to various ad hoc approaches. For instance, it has said that we will advertise and try to get Australians to buy more Australian produced goods. But the fact is that no legislation has been introduced to bring in a buy Australian Act that would require people in this country, and particularly governments, where possible, to buy Australian made goods. There has been no attempt to slow down the takeover of Australia's manufacturing industries. The Government's attitude is that it does not matter who owns the industries any more; it does not matter whether they are Australian owned or foreign owned. The teeth of our Foreign Investment Review Board have been taken away. It would appear that it is now only a very small step before the Foreign Investment Review Board is disbanded altogether by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It does matter who owns our industries. It does matter whether they are foreign owned or Australian owned. The fact is that about 50 per cent of our industries are now owned by overseas interests; the other 50 per cent are owned by about one per cent of the Australian population. Why does it matter that there is not a greater degree of Australian owned industry? It is for the very simple reason that it is a demonstrable fact that Australian owned industries export more; they are more export oriented; they are not inhibited by export franchises that apply to most of our overseas owned industries. Our foreign owned motor car companies are told to where they can export. They cannot look at the world as a potential market. It is also a demonstrable fact that overseas owned companies do not invest in research in this country. They like to do the research at their home bases. It can easily be shown that Australian owned industries have a much better record on research than foreign owned industries. For those two very important reasons we should be concerned about the degree of overseas ownership of our industries. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that we have to look to our manufacturing industries to earn foreign exchange and to solve the problem of our balance of payments. Unfortunately, very little in a concrete way has been put forward as a plan to develop rapidly our manufacturing sector. The fact is that Australia is really still a Third World economy. We still rely on exports of our wool, coal, wheat, meat and minerals. Unfortunately, these products have a very low value added. With the exception of wool, they are trying to compete on a glutted world market, often with subsidised products from our competitors. The high value added manufacturing industries should be exporting. In comparison with other Western countries, Australia has a very poor record. Only about 15 per cent of our exports presently are manufactured goods while in other Western countries the percentage is much higher and more like 80 per cent. If we are not to be a Third World country but are to be in the league of industrialised countries, we have to do something about that pretty urgently. We have to do something about it now. </PARA>
<PARA> This year our shortfall, our foreign debt, will probably be over $16 billion. It is a very critical shortfall. To continue on this course will only mortgage our future to pay for our current expenses. This strategy will send us broke in double quick time if it is continued. Our foreign debt is currently at $80 billion and is tipped to rise to over $100 billion by the end of next year, so the day of reckoning is not very far away. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Hawke Government we have seen more deregulation and more kowtowing to foreign markets than we have ever seen before in Australia's history. There will be no future if we continue to follow the path of financial deregulation. We must manage the economy. We cannot sit back and let market forces run it for us. That is a disastrous policy which has led us into this critical position right now. </PARA>
<PARA> So what do we do about getting our manufacturing industries more competitive? What do we do to make our industries export oriented and to make them look at the whole world as their potential market? I said that we need a long term indicative plan. We need co-operation between government and industry, the unions and the work force, along the Japanese model. For instance, the Japanese Government takes responsibility for collecting data on potential markets all around the world and then calls the industries together and discusses those potential markets and what can be done to capture a realistic percentage of them. There is co-operation between industries and the Government. When the plan is sorted out and they have a realistic assessment of what of the potential world market the local industries can hope to capture, the Government sits down and co-operatively discusses with those industries whether they have to increase their productive capacity, if so to what degree and so on. The industries go away knowing that there is a plan and that they should spend money to develop their resources to meet that plan. For instance, they know that their Government will encourage development to a certain percentage in the automotive industry, the shipbuilding industry, the steel industry, the computer industry, the machine tool industry or whatever; there is that co-operation. We could do that but so far there has been very little progress, although the Government has at times paid some lip-service to a more co-operative approach to our manufacturing and export oriented industries. If we had this co-operative approach, the Government could be more selective in what sort of help it could give to industries which would be most effective, and what sorts of industries could be helped. It would be a rifle shot approach rather than the shotgun approach which tries to spread assistance widely through industries, many of which would not have export potential anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> If our industries are to be competitive, we must get co-operation between unions and between managements. There has been virtually no attempt to develop this approach in this Budget or generally by the Government. There is no doubt that the success of Japanese industry has been due simply to its ability to harness the efforts, brain power and co-operation of the entire work force in the interests of making Japanese industries as efficient as possible. In the Toyota company last year, for instance, there were no fewer than 1.9 million suggestions from the workers of that company. There were about 38 suggestions per worker per year. Of those suggestions, 90 per cent were acted on by management. A company structure that allows the whole work force to be involved in that way, as it has been in the Toyota organisation, will win every time. It is not an approach that one can introduce overnight; it takes many years to get the confidence and trust of the people in the work force that one is genuinely interested in hearing their ideas and trying to work out better ways. But it can be done. A start must be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Had this Government wished, it could have taken steps to encourage this to happen very quickly. There is before the Senate now an Employee Participation Bill of mine which is still awaiting debate and which lays down five criteria which, if adopted by companies, would make them eligible for government incentives. These are criteria such as the small group activity to which I have just alluded. The Bill also sets out criteria such as more employee share ownership or profit sharing techniques that allow the success of an enterprise to be shared with the whole work force. It sets out cellular organisational structures or profit centres around small groups of people, so that people can relate to each other and understand what is going on and are not just a part of an enormous hierarchy in which they are working away but do not realise where they are going. </PARA>
<PARA> These initiatives are vitally important if we are to get our industries as efficient as the Japanese industries and as our competitor industries in other Western countries. Unfortunately, although there has been some talk by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Willis, and his Department about industrial democracy and employee participation, virtually no action has occurred. This matter has been going on for a long time. Why can the Government not allow a Bill which is already before the Senate to be debated, and amended if necessary, get the legislation into place, and then let the broad range of industries right across Australia strive to meet the criteria of greater employee involvement and get things moving? It would not cost the Government much money. It is estimated that the cost would be less than $50m a year-a very small price to pay for getting our industries to a state in which they are able to compete and to export. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment is a critical problem in Australia. It is a great tragedy but one which could be solved overnight if the Government wanted to do that. If we cannot offer everyone in Australia who wants to work employment for eight hours a day, surely what we should be doing is sharing the available work. There are many people, women in particular, who would be very happy to be able to work, say, three or four hours a day, rather than to work eight hours a day or not work at all. There are many people who are reaching retirement age who would like to work less than an eight-hour day. Why can we not share the available work amongst all those who wish to work?</PARA>
<PARA> It means, of course, that we must negotiate with the unions and get an hourly rate, I suggest, rather than penalty rates and other work practices that prohibit our getting to a stage at which we can reasonably share the available work. But this can be done. If we had a system of enabling companies to negotiate with the unions on a whole range of issues for their particular company, it could be done. I am sure that it will never happen and that we will never solve our work practices problem unless we do it on a company-by-company basis. We will not do it centrally through the conciliation and arbitration system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my intention to introduce next week a Collective Agreements Bill, which would set up a legislative framework which would allow this direct negotiation on a broad range of issues on a company-by-company basis without cutting across the centralised wage fixing system. It would allow companies, if they so wished, voluntarily to engage in direct negotiations with the unions on a broad range of issues that affect the companies. The essential points about this Bill are that it lays down that the negotiations must be on an above-award basis-one cannot negotiate awards downwards, as I understand the Liberal Party will attempt to do if it ever gets into power-and that the trade union movement cannot be bypassed, so the negotiations must be undertaken with the trade union movement. With these two provisos, it is then possible to have collective agreements which allow broad negotiation over a whole range of issues. That is critically important. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also before this Parliament a youth employment Bill, which again sets out to share the available work so that the unemployed youth of this country can work at least on a permanent part time basis and get work experience without getting involved in some of the Mickey Mouse schemes that are around today, under which it is said: `Here is four weeks work. You may work for that long and then at the end of four weeks you are unemployed again, on the scrap-heap'. That is disastrous for young people, but it is what is going on. Why can we not give unemployed youth a permanent part time work role in our society so that they become part of the work force, get the work experience and can apply for full time work in the sure knowledge that they are at least employed on a permanent part time basis?</PARA>
<PARA> The other important problem is that of investment in our productive industries. That is not happening. Dr Mazouk, a visiting professor at Macquarie University, has put out a paper and will shortly be putting out a book on his research into the disparity between what he calls financial investment and productive investment. He has traced the trends in financial investment as opposed to productive investment over the last 30 years. It is found that it trends something like this: Back in the 1960s about 50 per cent of investment in this country went into productive areas, such as building industries, investing in machines and so forth, and 50 per cent went into financial investment such as putting money into the stock exchange and so forth. Right now, however, the overwhelming investment is going into financial investment and very little of it is going into productive investment. Why is that so? It is because there is a great incentive to invest in financial areas and a very great disincentive to invest in productive resources. </PARA>
<PARA> One has only to see what is going on in the stock exchange to appreciate the exact extent of the problem. Enormous amounts of money have been invested this year and in previous years-for instance, $5.5 billion in defending and attempting to take over the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd alone. There has been no additional productive capacity to BHP with that $5.5 billion investment, and not one additional job was created in spite of that enormous investment. Something like $500m was borrowed from the Bank of New South Wales by the Bond Corporation to takeover Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd. Did that increase the efficiency of Castlemaine Tooheys? I suggest not. I suggest that that money was used simply in an attempt to get a Western Australian beer into the eastern markets. </PARA>
<PARA> People are pursuing paper profits because that is the easiest way to make money. There is a tax incentive. If a company borrows money and uses that borrowed money to buy shares in another company, two things happen. First of all, the company can write off the interest on the money it has borrowed through all sorts of other activities it is engaged in. It does not have to write off that interest bill against the profits from the shares it buys; it can write it off against profits in every one of its other activities. Then, of course, the dividends from the shares it has bought are tax free in the hands of the company. So, in effect, there is double dipping. The company gets a deduction from the borrowings and it gets the dividends tax free. Contrast that with a company that decides to expand its productive capacity by buying a machine. What happens there? The interest on the money borrowed to buy the machine is tax deductible but the profits that that machine earns are taxable. So immediately the company that is trying to expand its productive resources is at a disadvantage compared to the company that expands through takeovers. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been pointed out by me and others time and time again. The Government has refused to act. I would have thought that the problem should be plain to the Government; it is certainly plain to most Australians when they sit back and see the enormous profits that have been made by the Bond Corporation, Elders-IXL Ltd and the Holmes a Court companies, when they see the enormous profits that have been made purely in share trading, in speculating on the stock market. The tragedy of the matter is that if the stock market should collapse all that money would be wasted. At least if it were invested in machinery, in productive capacity, that machinery and productivity capacity would still exist if the stock market collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> So we are treading a fine line. We are running an economy that is headed for bankruptcy, without doubt, because we are continuing to borrow money. We are continuing to spend money we do not have, and this current Budget makes no attempt to change that direction. Unfortunately members of the Liberal Party are not shouting from the rooftops that there has to be a change of direction. They are simply saying we should let market forces run the economy. The Australian Labor Party says the same thing. It amazes me that some members of the Labor Party have not been able to see the great similarity between this market forces philosophy and the laissez-faire survival of the fittest philosophy that was so prevalent in the early part of the nineteenth century. It is an identical philosophy. It says, simply, that governments do not have to worry, the market can run the country and the government does not have to do anything about it. That is another way of saying we will let the survival of the fittest prevail. It took the French Revolution, the storming of the Bastille, to change that laissez-faire attitude of the nineteenth century. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know how we can change the philosophy that the Liberal and Labor parties are espousing today. It is a critical problem for this country. There has to emerge somewhere concern by the Australian people as to what is going on. They must demand a change of direction. An alternative approach to economic management in this country must be debated. I cannot understand why at least some branches around the country of the once great Labor Party somewhere are not coming out and saying: `Look, why don't we debate within the Labor Party itself an alternative approach?'. Why are members of the Labor Party sitting back asking what they can do, suggesting that this is the only approach they can take, that they have to let market forces run, that they have to borrow money overseas. We have to stop borrowing money overseas. We cannot do that overnight, but we must plan to start doing it. We have to do something to reduce the flow of imports by some means or other. We could impose a luxury tax. In fact, the Australian Democrats in their alternative Budget suggested just that. We could put a tax on luxury imports such as the orange juice being imported from Brazil while our own growers are letting their oranges drop to the ground because they cannot afford to pick them. If we put, say, a six per cent tax on about one-fifth of our imports, we would raise something like $1.5 billion, which would go a long way towards reducing the Government's deficit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the adjournment on a matter which is of concern to me and I am sure is of concern to many Australians. The situation is that we have a Treasurer who is neglecting the proper operation of his Department, who is ceasing to be responsible to this Parliament, who is ceasing to answer his correspondence, and who in many ways is spending his time on other pursuits. I do not know quite what those other pursuits are, but they might be winding clocks, filling out travelling allowance forms or renovating his terrace in Sydney. Whatever it is, it is quite clear that he is not attending to the proper business of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw attention to the fact that throughout the year Mr Keating has refused to answer questions from both the Opposition and the media on tax matters and matters relating to his portfolio. The Treasurer brushed aside Opposition questions in the other place and told members that they should put such questions on notice. However, Mr John Hodges, a Liberal member for Queensland, has had questions on notice unanswered by the Treasurer for over a year. In addition, the Treasurer has not even acknowledged, let alone answered, 11 letters I have written to him over a period of five months on behalf of constituents. The subjects on which I have written to him on behalf of constituents have included the introduction of a sales tax on flavoured milk and fruit juices. I have sent him letters on 18 July, 8 August, 8 September and 13 October. I also wrote to him on 10 July on the classification of an invalid spouse under the Income Tax Assessment Act. I wrote to him on 7 July, 29 July, 1 September and 17 October in regard to exemption from taxation for a sporting organisation, in this case a pony club. On 14 August and 23 September I wrote to the Treasurer in relation to the effect of the fringe benefits tax on a non-profit making educational institution. I also wrote to him on 2 October concerning the National Trust and its problems with the fringe benefits tax. The Treasurer has seen fit to acknowledge none of those letters, which, I emphasise, were written on behalf of constituents. He has not even tried to answer them. When we take into account that he has also had a policy of never replying to Senator Michael Tate in his capacity as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills-he has not sent one letter in response to that Committee's concerns-we have to wonder what he regards as being the due operation of his portfolio. He is responsible to this Parliament yet he seems to regard it with a total arrogance. When members of the Parliament are performing their proper duties as members of parliament they cannot get correspondence answered by the Treasurer at all, they cannot get questions taken seriously in the Parliament and they have not had questions on notice answered for more than a year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Special Premiers' Conference on Drugs (held in Canberra on 2 April 1985) agreed in principle that legislation be introduced in each jurisdiction to enable for forfeiture and confiscation of assets of convicted drug dealers and noted that the question would be further considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG).</PARA>
<PARA> In October 1985 at the request of SCAG, the Commonwealth prepared and circulated to the States a preliminary draft model Bill providing for the imposition of a pecuniary penalty (representing the benefits an offender has derived from serious criminal conduct) as well as the forfeiture of property used in or obtained as a result of the commission of an offence.</PARA>
<PARA> In November 1985 New South Wales enacted legislation along the lines of the Commonwealth Model Bill. South Australia has also enacted legislation and other States have indicated that they are about to follow.</PARA>
<PARA> The States have continued to be interested in the development of the model legislation as it was agreed that there should be provisions for the reciprocal enforcement of forfeiture and pre-trial restraining orders in other jurisdictions. Without such provisions State legislation would be ineffective where an offender's forfeitable assets are located in another jurisdiction. A reciprocal enforcement scheme was finally agreed to by SCAG on 25 September 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> On 26 September 1986 the Commonwealth Government announced that it would be introducing comprehensive legislation to attack the proceeds of crime. This legislation will provide for tougher forfeiture provisions than were contemplated in other jurisdictions where persons had been convicted of drug trafficking, organised fraud and money laundering. In these cases all the offender's assets will be liable to automatic forfeiture at the expiration of 6 months after conviction, subject to the offender establishing that they were not acquired as a result of criminal activity.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The matter is currently being monitored by the Ministerial Council of Drug Strategy who have responsibility for the follow-up action on the matters agreed to at the Special Premiers' Conference on Drugs, and, as has been indicated, the matter has been discussed in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) On 26 September 1986 the Government announced that it will be introducing a comprehensive legislative package to attack the proceeds of crime. The legislation approved by the Government would:</PARA>
<PARA> * permit, after conviction, the forfeiture of property used in, or obtained as a result of the commission of an indictable offence against the law of the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA> * require for more serious offences the automatic forfeiture of the offenders assets 6 months after conviction (subject to the offender establishing that they were legitimately acquired);</PARA>
<PARA> * permit, prior to conviction the tracing and freezing of property that may be subject to forfeiture;</PARA>
<PARA> * create new offences of ``money laundering'' (the process by which profits of crimes are disguised in order to make them appear legitimate);</PARA>
<PARA> * require keeping of certain financial records by financial institutions and permit subject to safeguards, access to such records; and</PARA>
<PARA> * provide for proper identification of all persons and corporations opening bank accounts.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government also indicated that it was favourably disposed to the introduction of legislation requiring financial institutions to report currency transactions above a specified amount. This may be required for the effective enforcement of these new measures.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has agreed to examine the practicalities of introducing such a scheme. The Attorney-General, the Special Minister of State and the Treasurer, will be reporting back to the Government on this matter by November 1986-after further consultation, including talks with financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that most States and the Commonwealth already have some form of forfeiture legislation in relation to assets derived from the commission of serious drug offences. New South Wales and South Australia have also recently enacted legislation providing for the forfeiture of assets derived from criminal conduct in general.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) This matter has been the subject of consideration not only by the Commonwealth Government but also by the Australian Police Ministers Council and subsequently the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG). As SCAG agreed in principle that uniform legislation on this subject should be introduced in each jurisdiction the proposals have required full consultation with the States and the Northern Territory. The new Commonwealth legislation will go much further than the State legislation and the complex nature of the issues raised by the proposal required lengthy and detailed consideration (including consideration of the US Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organisations Statute, as well as similar legislation in other countries).</PARA>

The honourable senator also sought an explanation of the apparent disparity between the number of persons receiving unemployment benefit and the number seeking employment. I undertook to direct the question to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations who has provided the following response:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Between April 1983 and April 1986 employment (seasonally adjusted) in Australia increased by 669,400 according to the Labour Force Survey. This figure comprises net growth of 460,600 in full-time employment and 208,800 in part-time employment. Some 69 percent of the employment growth was therefore full-time.</PARA>
<PARA> The latest figures available on unemployment benefit (UB) recipients are for the week ending 29 August 1986 when there were 573,735 persons receiving UB. This compared with 595,600 persons unemployed and actively seeking employment as estimated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), for the month of August 1986. Neither of these figures are seasonally adjusted.</PARA>
<PARA> There are significant and fundamental differences between figures on unemployment, which are derived by the ABS from a population survey, and those on UB which are an administrative series. For example, persons in part-time or casual employment may retain eligibility for some UB payment under current testing provisions. Such persons would be classified by the ABS as employed, provided they worked one hour or more in the survey week. On the other hand, some unemployed persons are ineligible for UB for such reasons as spouse income, age or attendance at full-time education.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The nuclear policy mission conducted in February-March 1985 comprised two SES officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and one officer from the Department of Trade.</PARA>
<PARA> The two Foreign Affairs officers visited Japan, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Ireland and the Federal Republic of Germany. One officer also visited France, Italy and Greece.</PARA>
<PARA> The mission was authorised at this time so as to sensitise member States of the European Community as well as the European Commission to Australian interests in issues involving the NPT and the forthcoming third NPT Review Conference, and in their decision-making relating to the proposed enlargement of the European Community to include Spain (a non-NPT member) and Portugal (a NPT member). The timing of the Mission was determined by the timing of EC enlargement set for 1 January 1986 and of the third NPT Review Conference (27 August-21 September 1985). Inclusion of Tokyo on the itinerary facilitated consultations on NPT-related matters with the Japanese. It also provided an opportunity for bilateral consultations under the Australia/Japan safeguards agreement. In the case of the visits to the Netherlands and Italy, the mission was a response to outstanding requests for consultations among officials on issues concerning the NPT.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) and (c) Mr D. A. Townsend, the then Assistant Secretary Nuclear Policy Branch, Department of Foreign Affairs. Mr G. A. Brennan, Legal Adviser, Department of Foreign Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Mr Townsend has been a Foreign Affairs officer since 1964 and has served in a number of posts. At the time of the nuclear policy mission he had been in charge of branches dealing with nuclear policy and safeguards matters for approximately six years.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Brennan has been the Department's Legal Adviser since 1980. He was Assistant Legal Adviser from 1978 to 1980. He has since 1978 been associated with the negotiation and implementation of Australia's nuclear safeguards agreements and also with the provision of legal advice in respect of Australia's non-proliferation policies and associated international legal obligations.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There have been no other visits abroad by officers of the Department with the specific purpose of pursuing the matters referred to under (1) above. Australian delegations did participate in the three meetings of the Preparatory Committee for the Third NPT Review Conference and at the Conference itself. I presented a full report on the Conference to the Parliament last year. I would point out also that for many years successive Australian Governments have pursued both bilaterally and multilaterally Australia's interest in preventing the further proliferation of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. This Government has done so with particular vigour.</PARA>

Sadleir, the then First Assistant Secretary, Executive, Policy Planning and Defence Division, Department of Foreign Affairs (an SES officer with extensive service in Canberra and overseas, including Japan, the United States and the Soviet Union, and whose responsibilities in his position as Division Head included supervision of the Policy Planning Unit).</PARA>
<PARA> Mr R. E. Little, the then Head of the Policy Planning Unit, Department of Foreign Affairs (a Foreign Affairs Officer Class 4, equivalent to a CAC 11. Mr Little is a senior officer with previous posting experience in Japan, Laos, Bangladesh, Ireland, China and Jamaica.)</PARA>
<PARA> Dr R. W. Rigby, then a staff member of the Policy Planning Unit, Department of Foreign Affairs (a Foreign Affairs Officer Class 2, equivalent to a CAC 7. Dr Rigby previously served in Japan and China). Both Mr Little and Dr Rigby are Japanese speakers.</PARA>
<PARA> Also taking part in the talks in Tokyo were the then Australian Ambassador to Japan, Sir Neil Currie; the Minister at the Australian Embassy, Mr C. R. Jones; and the Counsellor at the Australian Embassy, Mr C. G. S. Willis.</PARA>
<PARA> The Japanese delegation at the talks was led by the Director-General of the Information Analysis, Research and Planning Bureau in the Japanese Ministry of Fo-reign Affairs. Also taking part on the Japanese side were staff members of this Bureau and of other Bureaux in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of these talks, the ninth in a series, was to have a wide-ranging exchange of views with senior Japanese officials on political and economic questions of common interest. The main topics addressed at the talks included East-West relations, the South Pacific, China, South-East Asia, Pacific economic cooperation, the Bonn Economic Summit, the Indian Ocean, and the global multilateral system. The talks contributed usefully to our understanding of Japanese views on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA> Meetings also were held with the National Institute for Research Advancement; the Nomura Research Institute; and the Japanese Institute of International Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Sadleir travelled directly between Australia and Japan, while Mr Little and Dr Rigby on the return journey visited Jakarta for two days of talks with Indonesian counterparts, from 31 March to 2 April. They saw the Director-General of the Policy Research and Development Agency in the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They also saw a senior member of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.

<PARA> (1) The Government has endorsed development by the Department of Aviation of an Airways Plan designed to increase efficiency and productivity within the Airways System while maintaining or improving levels of air safety and continuing to provide adequate air traffic services. A key element of this plan is the consolidation of air traffic services into fewer, larger centres where staff resources may be used more efficiently.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Sub-item 82a (1) in the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemption and Classifications) Act exempts from sales tax piping or tubing of a kind used exclusively, or primarily and principally, in the construction or repair of, and wrought into, or attached to, so as to form part of, buildings, fixtures, structures or other works. The Commissioner of Taxation has informed me that a review of the operation of the sub-item was recently conducted for the purpose of issuing guidelines on the extent to which piping and tubing are exempt from sales tax under the sub-item.</PARA>
<PARA> On the completion of the review, advice on the sales tax classification of piping and tubing products was issued to all sales taxpayers who were either known to be in the business of marketing piping or tubing products or could be identified as likely to be engaged in that business. As some taxpayers have been treating products as exempt from sales tax which, following the review, were considered to be taxable, liability to tax was made effective from a future date in order to give them time to adjust their accounting systems and prices. The date fixed was 19 May 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> As sales tax is a wholesale tax, liability for sales tax generally falls on manufacturers and wholesalers and not on retailers. Accordingly, it was not necessary to notify retailers of the rulings except where they had a sales tax liability, i.e. manufacturing retailers and retailers making wholesale sales. Retailers who were identified as affected by the rulings were notified by the Taxation Office.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 February 1986 (Hansard, page 169) Senator Siddons asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning Australia's foreign debt. As part of my answer I undertook to ask the Treasurer whether consideration had been given to controlling and regulating the inflow and outflow of capital. The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Prior to floating the Australian dollar in December 1984, as part of the exchange rate system, there was an extensive array of exchange controls directed primarily towards controlling capital flows. These controls were almost completely removed concurrently with the Government's decision to float the Australian dollar. That decision both reflected, and was a response to, the increasing integration of the Australian and international capital markets.</PARA>
<PARA> Re-introduction of exchange controls would be inconsistent with the Government's deregulatory initiatives in the financial sector and would have significant costs, both administratively for authorities and business, and in terms of inefficiencies in the operation of international capital flows.</PARA>
<PARA> The pre-float experience of capital controls pointed up the limitations of exchange controls in controlling large undesirable capital movements. Moreover capital controls were part of the apparatus whereby the former Government maintained an overvalued exchange rate which has had such detrimental effects on Australian industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 March 1986 (Hansard, page 1233) Senator Siddons asked the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, a question without notice concerning technical aspects of company takeovers. Senator Button undertook to seek advice from the Treasurer, who has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issues raised by Senator Siddons have now been addressed in depth in Treasury Economic Paper No. 12 entitled ``Some Economic Implications of Takeovers''. The main points flowing from that analysis are presented below.</PARA>
<PARA> The basic purpose of section 46 is to ensure that dividends paid out of income on which company tax may already have been paid once are not subject to further taxation as they pass through the corporate chain before being taxed again (under the classical system) in the hands of the individual shareholder.</PARA>
<PARA> High Court decisions between 1931 and 1953 have resulted in a situation where virtually no interest deductions need be subtracted from dividends in calculating the section 46 rebate unless they exclusively relate to the earning of dividends. Because some legal uncertainty may still exist on that point, arrangements such as those alluded to by Senator Siddons appear to have been used by some companies in acquiring shares in other companies in order to avoid the risk of interest expenses having to be deducted from the share dividends received in calculating the section 46 rebate on those dividends.</PARA>
<PARA> The question whether the section 46 rebate should be calculated on the basis of gross dividends received or net dividends after the deduction of associated interest expenses has been raised in connection with corporate takeover issues. The view expressed in Treasury Economic Paper No. 12 is that neither the history of sections 46 and 50, nor an in-principal analysis of how they ought to operate, compels the conclusion that they should work along the lines suggested in the question.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) Detailed specifications of the various types of nuclear reactors are not held by my Department. However, I note that each reactor type has different inherent characteristics, and hence requires different design features and safety systems to ensure safe operation under all foreseeable conditions. A containment structure is only one of the engineered safety systems which may be relevant to a particular reactor. Thus a realistic comparison of the overall safety levels of different reactor types would require a detailed study of many complex issues, and cannot be based on a consideration of containment provisions alone.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised me that some assessments have issued which do not include an amount of credit equal to the amount due to the taxpayer. There are a number of reasons for this, some to do with payer and payee error and omission, others arising from administrative oversight.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation advised that a range of additional measures are being introduced to streamline the processing of returns with prescribed payment credit. These measures should also significantly reduce the number of disputes about the amount of prescribed payment credit allowed in assessments.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Commissioner advised that the credit which has been allowed in the taxpayer's assessment is taken into account when calculating provisional tax.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Commissioner has advised that assessments are due and payable on the date specified in the notice of assessment or on the 30th day after service of the notice on the taxpayer, whichever is the later. Thus, normally, if an assessment issues more that 30 days before the end of June, that assessment will be due for payment before the end of the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Commissioner acknowledges that some assessments have issued more than 4 months after the returns were lodged. These returns represent the most difficult ``mismatch'' cases.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Taxation Office is empowered to proceed with legal action to recover outstanding tax whether a dispute exists or not. Additional tax on amounts unpaid accrues at the rate of 20% per annum from the date on which the tax became due and payable. The Commissioner assures me that where a discrepancy as to the amount of prescribed payment credit is resolved in the taxpayer's favour, the taxpayer is not required to bear any penalty in relation to the amount involved in the discrepancy. Where an assessment is the subject of a genuine dispute, an extension of time for payment of portion of the amount of tax in dispute is generally allowed.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Yes. However, the Commissioner is authorised to remit the additional tax, or part of the additional tax, in limited circumstances. The additional tax is not allowable as a deduction against assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) A taxpayer who successfully objects or appeals against an assessment is entitled to interest on any resultant refund of tax overpaid. No interest is payable on refunds resulting from original assessments. The current interest rate is 14.026%, and any amount of interest paid or applied under the relevant provisions is itself assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) No. The Commissioner has assured me that the estimates in respect of tax collections and outstanding tax liabilities represent an accurate and realistic estimate of the collections and liabilities for the year ended 30 June 1986.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 September 1986 (Hansard, page 701) Senator Cook asked me, as Minister representing the Special Minister of State, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that an examination of the compulsory returns from political parties since the 1984 Federal election does not disclose any donations from Mr Ric New or his Midland Brick Co. Pty Ltd to the Western Australian Branch of the Liberal Party of Australia, would the Minister check to see that those returns have been properly filed and donations properly disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA>The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 was amended in 1984 to require all political parties to disclose after an election all donations of $1000 or more received since the last election, apart from those which were made on the condition that they be used for a purpose other than a purpose related to an election, and which were so used.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the 1984 election the Australian Electoral Commission had proposed to audit a sample of parties' financial records in order to establish how well parties had understood, and fulfilled, their obligations under the new funding and disclosure provisions. The Opposition parties, however, challenged the legality of the proposed audit.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed audit was subsequently abandoned by the Electoral Commission in the light of legal advice it received that there is no power under the Electoral Act to require parties to produce records in order to establish whether the provisions requiring disclosure of donations have been complied with.</PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of that power I am unable to advise whether or not donations have been received by the Western Australian Branch of the Liberal Party which should have been disclosed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Western Australian Mines Department confirms that there has been no uranium exploration or mining on the Cundeelee Reserve, although the company has identified a uranium deposit approximately 40 kilometres north of the Reserve. PNC has not sought permission to enter the Reserve at any stage.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Aboriginal Development Commission, after full consultation and with the agreement of the community, purchased the Coonana pastoral lease for the Upurl Upurlila Ngurratja Community in 1983 because the Cundeelee area had proven incapable of sustaining a water supply for the community.</PARA>
<PARA> Since then, all members of the community of approximately 360 people have elected to move to Coonana. All the movements have been completely voluntary, and occurred progressively as small groups made their own decision.</PARA>
<PARA> It is hoped that an adequate water supply can be progressively developed at Coonana which has better capabilities for surface catchments.</PARA>
<PARA> The chemical quality of water at both Cundeelee and Coonana is excellent, and the bacteriological quality is slightly better at Coonana owing to the community not camping in the catchment area. Both sites are bacteriologically treated, although Cundeelee has been unoccupied since January 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Commonwealth has no authority in respect of the granting of mining leases in Western Australia, such granting being the responsibility of the State Government. However, there has been no change to the Federal Government's policy, which permits exports of uranium from only the Ranger, Nabarlek, and Olympic Dam projects. The PNC operation is at the exploration stage and it is unlikely to proceed to the development stage in circumstances where it is unable to obtain export permits.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) and (6) PNC operations are authorised by the Western Australian Government and information on exploration activities should be obtained from Western Australia. There have been no shipments of uranium from PNC's Officer Basin (Mulga Rock) prospect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 20 August 1986 (Hansard, page 133-135) Senator Chaney asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice, concerning the estimate of the number of unemployment benefit recipients in 1986-87. The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The estimate of the number of unemployment benefit recipients in 1986-87 is based on forecasts of the number of unemployed persons and of the ratio of recipients to unemployed. The number of unemployed persons, in turn, depends upon the rate of growth of employment and the rate of growth of the labour force.</PARA>
<PARA> Employment grew very strongly in 1985-86 (3.9 per cent) and a slow-down to about 1.75 per cent is expected in 1986-87. Much of the forecast growth in the average level of employment for 1986-87 is accounted for by the strong increase in employment through the course of 1985-86. Employment growth is expected to be modest through the remainder of 1986-87.</PARA>
<PARA> The labour force participation rate (and, therefore, the labour force) grew strongly through 1985-86 and is currently at a high level. It is expected that the participation rate will level out and perhaps decline a little through 1986-87 due, in part, to the weakening in labour demand. This would slow the rate of growth of the labour force.</PARA>
<PARA> The above considerations imply some increase in the unemployment rate in 1986-87 from its average level of 7.9 per cent in 1985-86.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a long-term rising trend in the number of unemployment benefit recipients as a proportion of the number of unemployed persons. In 1985-86, the ratio was 95.5 per cent, compared with 94.6 per cent in 1984-85 and 78.9 per cent in 1981-82. A further increase in this ratio was assumed for 1986-87, before allowance for the improvements in unemployment benefit administration announced in the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> On the foregoing basis, the number of unemployment benefit recipients was estimated to rise from 559,000 in 1985-86 to 605,000 in 1986-87. The administrative improvements announced in the Budget are estimated to reduce this number to 595,000, which is the basis of the Budget estimate of unemployment benefit outlays.</PARA>

<PARA> The Government does not fund the African National Congress (ANC) and the South West African Peoples Organisation (SWAPO) via the Commonwealth Secretariat.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government position regarding the representation of the ANC and SWAPO in Australia was stated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 26 October 1983. No government funding is made available to either organisation in respect of the information offices they have established.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does, however, provide funding for a limited range of humanitarian programs for southern Africa and in some instances the southern African nationalist movements are eligible for assistance under these programs. These programs are:</PARA>
<PARA> provision of undergraduate scholarships in Australia for black South African and Namibian refugees. This program is managed by the Commonwealth Secretariat in London and is open to student nominations from the nationalist movements (ANC/SWAPO/ and Pan Africanist Congress);</PARA>
<PARA> humanitarian assistance through multilateral channel to various United Nations Funds for Namibian and southern African refugees, including education ($320,000 in 1985/86);</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 12 June 1986:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Will the Minister for Communications in the light of material contained in an article by Anthony McAdam in The Bulletin of 10 June 1986, instigate an investigation into the decision of Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) management to have Mr Mark Aarons produce the radio series titled ``Nazis in Australia'' and to hire Mr John Loftus as his co-researcher; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Will the Minister investigate why, given the highly controversial nature of the series, no reputable historian of World War II appears to have been involved either in the programs or as a consultant.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Did the Corporation or management of the ABC responsible for ABC programs take any steps to ensure that the programs would be fair-minded and intellectually defensible; if so, what steps; and if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Is the Minister concerned about the program's smear by insinuation of thousands of Australian citizens in several ethnic communities who share the universal Australian loathing of Nazism and, if so, will he ensure that disciplinary action is taken against the officers of the ABC concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Do these programs violate the ABC's own explicit guidelines referring to balanced and fair-minded coverage of controversial issues; if so, will the Minister ensure that the ABC will, in the near future, broadcast a prominently featured and genuinely open discussion of the issues raised by the Aarons-Loftus series to which those ethnic communities smeared by insinuation in the programs can nominate their own spokesmen.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) How much did the ABC spend on research and travel in the preparation of the radio series.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) How much was Mr Loftus paid for his contribution to the series.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) How much did the ABC spend on the lavish pre-broadcast press advertisements.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Was Mr Laurie Aarons, the former national secretary of the Communist Party of Australia, in any way engaged in researching the series; if so, in what capacity and what was he paid for his services.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2085" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has pointed out that this question relates to a programming matter and it is inappropriate for him to comment. Nevertheless he sought the advice of the ABC about questions (2) to (9) which is included in the following response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. The ABC as an independent statutory authority is able to make its own programming decisions and I do not consider it appropriate to interfere in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) `Background Briefing-Nazis in Australia' did use a reputable historian of World War II. Professor Raoul Hilberg was interviewed in the series, and his information also was used in preparation for the programs. The producers, needless to say, read widely in preparation for the programs and a bibliography of the histories used in research would include many eminent, authoritative and internationally recognised historians.</PARA>
<PARA> Professor Hilberg is recognised as one of the international experts on the Jewish Holocaust, and has testified in cases involving war criminals living in America. U.S. courts have described him as ``eminently qualified'' to give such expert testimony.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes, the Corporation did take such steps as it does with all its programs. The story is an important one. Mark Aarons is a senior journalist and producer with the ABC. The series was carefully researched and documented. Other senior people worked with and assisted Mr Aarons in his research and production, and each program was listened to by lawyers and editorial management before it went to air.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The programs did not smear any large groups by insinuation. The programs dealt only with the activities of certain groups who collaborated with the Nazi Government. At no time was anything said which concerned or implicated all the members of any European Community. The programs did not imply that those groups who collaborated with the Nazi authorities were supported by significant numbers of any regional population. The programs documented and investigated the history of some individuals and suggested a further investigation would reveal others who may have escaped the international judicial processes that were taking place after World War II.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The programs did not violate the ABC's guidelines on the coverage of controversial issues. They comprised journalistic investigation, using original material, which formed part of the process of community discussion and debate on a very important issue. The ABC has documentation and evidence for the issues raised in its programs.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) There are two major components of the research involved in the preparation of the programs. One component comprised ongoing research, which falls within the normal salary and operational budgets allocated to the Talks Unit. The other major component was an overseas program gathering assignment, which is standard practice within the ABC for researching a story with such a significant overseas focus. Mark Aarons undertook a trip to Washington, London and Zagreb in June/July 1985. In addition to the standard staff travelling allowance, the costs involved were $3000 in airfares, and research costs of approximately $1500, covering search fees, photocopies of archival material and other necessary costs associated with an investigative project.</PARA>
<PARA> During this trip Mark Aarons secured much of the material which was central to the accuracy of the program.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Mr Loftus was paid a fee which covered a return airfare Boston/Sydney, two internal airfares in the United States for the purpose of assisting Mark Aarons in research in that country, and a fee based on standard rates for research, scripting, and his on-air contributions to the programs. As is usual practice within the ABC, the fee is regarded as a confidential agreement between Mr Loftus and the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The ABC arranged for a series of press advertisements at a level considered appropriate for a major national radio feature series. Because of the importance to the community of the issues covered in the programs, the ABC considered that publicity warranted a high priority.</PARA>
<PARA> The total cost of press advertising was $23,460.15, comprising $4,102.76 in production costs, and $19,357.39 for the advertising space.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Mr Laurie Aarons (Mr Mark Aarons father) was not engaged in researching the series.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question based on advice from the Australian Telecommunications Commission:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Both ISD and STD Call Charge Record (CCR) are available to Telecom customers.</PARA>
<PARA> ISD/CCR is currently available to approximately 3.3 million customers and will ultimately be provided to all customers as a standard service. On the other hand, STD/CCR is provided as an optional service and is available, within exchange capacity limitations, in all capital cities and the regional centres of Geelong and Mornington (Vic) and the Gold Coast (Qld). Further expansion in country areas is planned from 1987-88.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Because of the very large volume of STD calls, the provision of STD/CCR involves considerable additional capital investment by Telecom in major exchange equipment modifications and the provision of extensive data processing facilities. For this reason, Telecom applies a once only fee of $20 for connection to the service and an annual service fee of $24. Telecom also charges 10 cents usage fee per itemised STD call.</PARA>
<PARA> However, as ISD call volumes are much lower, ISD/CCR can be provided at much less expense to Telecom and no charges apply for connection to the service. The only applicable charge is $1.20 each time an itemised statement of calls is requested.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Telecom's metering system does not allow for the provision of an itemised statement of local calls.</PARA>
<PARA> However, there are several `in-house' facilities which Telecom uses to continuously monitor the performance of the metering system to ensure its accuracy.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The provision of local call CCR would require a major restructure of the telephone metering system as well as the provision of extensive data processing facilities. Telecom is not able to commit the very high level of capital investment required to provide this service.</PARA>

<PARA> (5) Australia was ranked 12th in the list of defence exporting countries in table 8.1 of the 1978 yearbook Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and 10th in the 1980 yearbook. As with any statistics of this kind, there are data and definitional problems. Further, the SIPRI statistics, particularly at the lower end of the ranking, are sensitive to the use of SIPRI trend indicators and the tables are intended to be representative of arms trade patterns rather than absolute levels of exports. These reservations notwithstanding, a small group of countries dominate arms exports (with the first five ranked countries accounting for over 90 per cent of total exports), and in these years, Australia accounted for only 0.2 of 1 per cent and 0.7 of 1 per cent of world arms exports.

<PARA> (1) Yes; however, the monitoring is done at Unit level. The statistics are not collated centrally because the manpower and computing resources which would allow central collation and comparison are not available. The comparative injury records requested cannot, therefore, be provided.</PARA>

<PARA> I refer to the refusal of mine workers at Broken Hill to comply with an interim award handed down by Justice Fisher. Is the Government aware of the effect this industrial dispute will have not only on Broken Hill but also on Broken Hill Associated Smelters which employs some 1,480 workers in Port Pirie and which, of course, is reliant on ore from Broken Hill? What action will the Government take to ensure compliance with the award noting that it has condemned businessmen for advocating breaches of the law in recent days and that the Government subscribes to our highly centralised industrial relations system and the strict application of our rigid award system?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been monitoring the ongoing industrial situation at Broken Hill and is aware of the implications which any prolonged stoppage could have for the communities of Broken Hill and Port Pirie.</PARA>
<PARA> It was the Government's concern over this matter which led to the meetings the Minister for Resources and Energy and myself had with unions and employers, on 30 May and 2 June this year respectively, to be briefed on developments. The Commonwealth has been involved in other meetings with the parties.</PARA>
<PARA> On 21 July the parties to the dispute agreed to an interim settlement which resulted in a return to work at Broken Hill on 22 July. The outstanding safety and other issues relevant to the dispute have been the subject of an investigation by a Technical Committee chiefly representative of the New South Wales Department of Industrial Relations which, I understand, presented its findings to the parties on 22 September. The parties have since been studying the report and having discussions on its findings and I understand that recourse is available to the New South Wales Industrial Commission should aspects be incapable of resolution.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the interim award handed down by Justice Fisher of the State Industrial Commission which the honourable senator has raised, I am advised that this award was rescinded by a Full Bench of that Commission on 25 July following the signing of a new agreement between the parties on 21 July. It should be emphasised that this dispute has principally been a matter for the New South Wales Government and the State Industrial Commission although the Commonwealth Government has remained available to assist in any appropriate way.</PARA>
