<PARA> The Petition of the undersigned shows: That we urge you to oppose the Australian Bill of Rights Bill because:</PARA>
<PARA> We get no legally enforceable rights under the Bill</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not guarantee vital rights such as the right not to belong to a trade union, the right to own private property and not be deprived of it without just compensation and the right of choice between Government and non-Government schools.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes.

<PARA> 2. Recognize that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection, storage and research has been publicly funded.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognise that any system giving `property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.</PARA>

<PARA> (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Australian Government was advised by the United States Administration early this morning of immediately impending military action against Libya. President Reagan has since confirmed that the United States has taken military action against targets which it regards as supporting terrorism. The Australian Government has counselled restraint by both the United States and Libya in the course of the developing tensions between them. It deeply regrets that this conflict has taken place and urges both sides to suspend hostilities and engage in genuine efforts to bring about the peaceful resolution of their differences. This will mean that the United States terminate its military engagements against Libya. It also means that as an absolute essential Colonel Gaddafi terminate his Government's indiscriminate export of terrorist activity against civilians and civilian targets, especially United States civilians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The United States has said that its action was motivated not only by evidence of Libyan involvement in and direction of past terrorist activities but also by indications of Libyan planning being well advanced for further operations against American citizens in a number of countries. The United States' military action was explained to us, not in terms of revenge or reprisals, but in terms of demonstrating that terrorism will incur a significant cost. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts that there is a substantial body of evidence of Libyan involvement in and direction of international terrorism. The Foreign Minister (Mr Hayden) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) have been privy to apparently compelling evidence of a direct line of command between Libya and the Berlin nightclub bombing. It is a matter of serious concern that following the Gulf of Sidra episode-where Libya attacked American forces exercising in international waters and the United States retaliated-Libya's policy of extreme hostility against the United States has continued. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in response to a request from President Reagan in January, took a number of economic measures against Libya and reduced Libya's official representation in Australia as part of collective international measures to demonstrate to Libya that its behaviour in support of international terrorism is totally unacceptable to the international community. The Government has expressed a desire to work with Western and other Governments for a concerted approach to dealing with international terrorism. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Hayden) is pursuing this matter with Western and other Governments and will be reporting back to Cabinet on measures to promote a sustained long-term effort to defeat the threat of international terrorism. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is profoundly concerned that the situation has reached the point where Libyan actions have driven the United States to regard it as essential that it take military action. Australia works persistently for a peaceful world. We are opposed to the use of violent means to resolve differences between nations and in particular to the resort of terrorism. Terrorism recognises no rules and respects no moral standards. The victims are almost always innocent victims. Australians have already been victims of this sort of activity, and that is another reason why we are implacably opposed to this sort of behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me sum up the Government's position. We wish to see restraint and an early end to hostilities. We hope that the conflict will not widen and escalate. We are fully conscious of the intractable and bitter conflicts of the Middle East, and the need for them to be resolved if the Middle East is to cease to be a source of violence and terrorism, not only in that region but throughout the world. We look for such a resolution. But an essential requirement for ending the fundamental confrontation between Libya and the United States must be that Libya completely and convincingly disavows recourse to terrorism. I move:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Australian Democrats)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Australian Democrats gave as much consideration as we could this morning to the news, delivered at about a quarter past ten on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio, that the United States Government had authorised an attack on certain targets in Libya. I must say that we are far from persuaded as to the wisdom of the action by the United States at this stage, after conceding that we condemn in total terms the proven acts of terrorism by Libya which have been documented over the years. It was indicated in the statement from President Reagan and repeated in the statement read to the Senate by Senator Button that the United States of America has taken action against targets which it regards as supporting terrorism. That statement is unique in its vagueness. All of us who know cities such as Tripoli, Benghazi and Jakarta, or whatever, know that surrounding those kinds of cities in the developing countries are enormous collections of human beings who form themselves into societies such as shanty towns and it is virtually impossible, with the sophistication of present day weapons, to hit a so-called `military target' without killing or wounding thousands of innocent human beings, including children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If this is the case in this instance-we do not know-it worries the Australian Democrats and it worries me that six hours after the so-called attack we are still so short on the following facts: Which targets were hit? By whom? With what? With what methodology? Were the aircraft based in the United Kingdom? Were they refuelled in mid-air? Was the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation informed? Were all nations of NATO informed? Did the United States live up to its obligations of informing its allies in NATO of this attack, because this sort of attack immediately puts into the perspective of the nation attacked, namely Libya, those kinds of nations as targets? Was Greece informed? Were the Turks informed? Was West Germany informed? To what extent were other allies of the United States informed, such as Australia? With an almost self-declared maniac like Gaddafi, who is the leader of the nation that has been attacked, it would not be beyond his mental insanity to attack any friend of the United States. We are a self-confessed friend of the United States. I would have thought that, as much as we deplore and abhor the kinds of mongrel activities of Gaddafi and his colleagues, we, as members of the Australian Parliament, have a fundamental obligation to care about the safety and protection of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not persuaded that Gaddafi does not have access to nuclear weapons from Pakistan. I would think that that would be likely. I would be worried because all authoritative sources indicate that Australia is a nuclear target of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and there is a closeness-I put it no more than that-between Libya and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has made noises about not allowing a situation such as a United States siege or attack on Libya to continue. I would believe-I put it no higher than that-that the safety of Australians could be involved in some way or other in this attack of the United States Government on Libya and on installations in Libya. </PARA>
<PARA> What are Libya's options, given that it is led by a dictator who is a madman-the mad dog of the Middle East, as aptly and accurately described by President Reagan? We have the United States, which has a population of over 230 million people and has the most sophisticated armoury in the world, attacking, in a military sense, a nation of something like three million people. What are the options open to a nation such as that? What are the options open to an insane mind like Gaddafi's? He will simply strike out not by attacking a giant-a Goliath-like the United States, but in the sneaky, mongrel-like way which he has done in the past. Whatever the merits or the demerits of a nation attacking another nation, I would have thought that this kind of attack makes it virtually incumbent upon the nation that has been attacked to strike back in the only way it knows possible-that is, not by military means. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders, with the sophistication and the advice that President Reagan and his advisers have, whether this retaliation-this lesson that had to be taught to Libya-might have been better done in a similar way, that is, by the American intelligence organisations, or whatever, rather than on a nation to nation basis. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I put it no higher than that because of the seriousness of the situation. It has been documented and it has been admitted that an attack by a nation was authorised by its Chief Executive, President Reagan, on another nation. If I might answer Senator Baume's interjection, with your indulgence, Mr President, Israel has shown with magnificent sophistication the way to handle that sort of problem. It has not necessarily always been handled on a nation to nation basis. I cite its action at Entebbe as one of the most brilliant acts by which it accomplished an end without involving the whole world in that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In any event, because the Democrats believe that Australia is a nuclear target in the global war struggle and because of the closeness that Libya has with the Soviet Union, without trying to overdramatise the situation, we have the view that it might not be the wisest course for the Prime Minister of this country to adopt to leave Australia at 3 o'clock this afternoon and to be out of the country at a time of such international crisis. More than that, there is the question that within 24 hours the Prime Minister of Australia, whether he likes it or not, will be publicly identified globally with the President of the United States in this situation. We wonder about the wisdom of that. </PARA>
<PARA> We know, from conversations we had with Cabinet Ministers at the time of the MX missile crisis, of the difficulty the Cabinet faces in discussing matters of such international and national importance while the Prime Minister is out of the country. If the situation deteriorates in the next 24 to 48 hours, without over-dramatising the situation, we suggest again that the best place for the Prime Minister of this country might well be in Australia and not 14,000 or 15,000 miles away. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-There can be no justification for the military action taken by the United States of America against Libya. Equally, there can be no justification for acts of terrorism which emanate from Libya. But to try to demonstrate by a show of force that the world will not put up with terrorism through the use of terrorism on a massive scale is counter-productive, to put it mildly. The American action was a stupid act which will only cause more violence. One cannot hope to solve the terrorist problems in the world through the use of counter-terrorist activities. The world is facing a very destabilising situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Chipp that it is a great shame that the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will be leaving Australia this afternoon to visit the United States of America on a day which I believe is a very sad day in the world's history. Despite Government protestations, his actions will be seen as support for the actions of the United States. No matter what is said by the Government, the very fact that the Prime Minister is going to the United States and will be seen with the President of the United States will be tantamount to Australian support for American action. I think it is a great shame that he is going there. I think he should delay his departure until we see whether this situation will escalate, as it well might, which would be a great tragedy for us all. </PARA>
<PARA> I will ask something a little unusual, Mr Presi- dent, in that I have drafted letters to both the Acting United States Ambassador, Mr Teare, and the Secretary of the Libyan People's Bureau in Canberra which I hope that senators from all sides of the chamber and members of the House of Representatives will sign, in order to express our concern and to ask that such acts of violence and intimidation in the Mediterranean cease. If the Senate wishes, I could read the wording of one of the letters-they are very similar-to be sent to the Libyan People's Bureau and to the United States Embassy. It is my hope that many senators in this chamber will consider that such an evenhanded approach is worthy of the adding of their signatures. We must take action as individuals as well as a nation in the face of such counterproductive and violent acts. We cannot solve terrorism by the use of terrorism. </PARA>

In the course of Cabinet's consideration of the submissions from the industry and from himself to modify the tax, were estimates from either his Department or the Treasury placed before it? If they were, and in light of the release of the industry survey, will the Minister make public the Government's own projections about loss of sales and jobs flowing from the tax?

There are a number of things which are difficult to identify, such as what the precise effects will be, because they depend so much on decisions of individual fleet managers and individual motorists. They depend considerably on what are described as behavioural effects and a whole range of things of that kind. In my view there has never been a great degree of certainty about the projections put forward by any side about the consequences of the tax. Added to that there are a wide range of other factors which impact on the motor vehicle industry or are likely to do so in 1986. Senator Chaney mentioned some of these in the urgency motion the other day. They include unleaded petrol, the decision relating to sales tax and no doubt a response by dealers and purchasers to bring forward demand into 1986 in order to avoid these effects. All those sorts of things are common knowledge. I am asked whether the Government will publish estimates which were given to us by my Department earlier in the year. I wish to consider that question. I think I probably will be able to do that but I am not sure that this is the appropriate time to intrude those figures into the discussion which is still taking place.

There is no information that any member made any prior application for a visa to visit Australia. The group had no documentation for entry, but all were granted two months temporary entry permits to allow time to consider another stay-except for the Captain, who is exempt from that requirement under the Migration Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The vessel appeared at Albany on 22 January, where it was seized by the Australian Federal Police under the provisions of the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966, acting on advice from Interpol that the vessel had been stolen in Israel. The Captain, Dr Hempel, and the sailing master, Mr Etheredge, were apprehended to face extradition charges and were subsequently released on surety. The property of the vessel was seized and held by Customs pending legal proceedings to determine their ownership. Applications for further temporary entry permits were made on 31 January 1986 and were refused on 14 March on the basis that the group were not bona fide visitors. The parties were directed to depart from Australia within 14 days. As Senator McKiernan said, the group subsequently applied for refugee status, despite the fact that earlier advice had been that they did not want to stay permanently. The claims were found to be manifestly unfounded in terms of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the related protocol.</PARA>

Why would such a person be a guest of the Australian taxpayer?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dr Jayewardene and Mr Carrascalao have been invited to Australia as part of the Department of Foreign Affairs regular program of visits by senior persons from other countries of interest to Australia. Under this program persons are invited in their own right and not necessarily in any official capacity. One of the purposes of the special overseas visitors program is to provide an opportunity for exposure to Australian perspectives on matters of common interest and concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian concerns about human rights issues in Sri Lanka and East Timor have been placed clearly on the record and are well known to Sri Lankan and Indonesian authorities. Dr Jayewardene has played a prominent role in the Sri Lankan Government's handling of the communal problem. He has led the government delegation to negotiations on the communal question and led the Sri Lankan delegation to the recently concluded session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva. His visit to Australia has, therefore, provided a valuable opportunity to Australia once again to register its concerns about the communal situation and to urge the Sri Lankan Government to pursue a policy of moderation in the handling of the problem. This opportunity has been taken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department in their discussions with Dr Jayewardene.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Carrascalao is a civilian Timorese who has been Governor of East Timor since September 1982. During his time as Governor the general situation in the province has improved and economic development has proceeded. The understanding of the Australian Government is that the human rights situation in the province continues to improve. The Australian Government's primary concern has been and remains to do all it can to help the people of East Timor. Since 1975 we have made contributions of around $90m to projects in the province conducted by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations Children's Fund and Governor Carrascalao has been helpful in relation to these projects since becoming Governor. Whilst here he will have discussions with the Government on the situation in East Timor.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to recent publicity about the cost of the Commonwealth compensation scheme. It ought to be noted, however, that escalation in the cost of compensation schemes is not confined to the public sector, let alone to the Commonwealth scheme. There is at least one other area where quite alarming cost escalations have taken place in recent years, and that is in the invalidity benefits-retirement sub-section of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, a matter about which I hope to be making a statement in the Senate before the end of the week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that a major cause of the escalation in both cases I have mentioned is the propensity of courts and tribunals to overturn long standing applications of the law, thereby causing large increases in outlays, an outcome for which, of course, the courts have no commensurate responsibility. In one particular area alone such actions by courts have increased expenditures by about $400m a year. An administrator of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme or a Commonwealth Government compensation commissioner, after a history of losing in appeal tribunals or court cases that should never have been lost, naturally adopts a more permissive application of the law. Indeed, the point has been reached where in the compensation areas something less than 2 per cent of the claims which are submitted are disallowed. That has a double-barrel effect and encourages more people to apply. It increases to almost 100 per cent the success rate of those who do apply. As I said before, a good deal of that arises from the fact that in Australia we have courts and tribunals which have and use de facto power over outlays but have no commensurate responsibility-indeed they have no responsibility at all. They have, moreover, an alarming record of capricious and ill-informed judgments.</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of what to do about that, I would like to establish a precedent under which such decisions were promptly overturned in the Parliament. For that reason the Government has introduced a Bill in the House of Representatives following the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on the Bewley case. That concerned the issue by the Commissioner of benefit classification certificates, which were issued if there was a pre-existing medical condition, and the effect of which was that, if premature retirement on invalidity grounds was later caused because of that pre-existing medical condition or defect, a lower rate of invalid pension may be paid; but only-I stress only-if retirement was caused by that identified and noted pre-existing medical condition. Up until the AAT decision of last year, a section of the regulation had always been interpreted to mean that, if there were any chance of the identified pre-existing medical defect causing a premature retirement, then a BCC would be issued. But with the intrusion of the AAT into this matter, the AAT ruled that there had to be a better than 50/50 chance that a person would be invalided by that identified medical condition. In other words, the AAT effectively ruled that benefit classification certificates were a thing of the past. The cost in present values of the additional pension that would have to be paid as a result of that decision to those who retired in 1984-85 alone amounts to about $35m. So it is not an insignificant amount of money. The Government has introduced that legislation to overturn the decision of the AAT and establish the precedent that I would like to see established, that is, when capricious and ill-informed decisions which have large expenditure consequences are made by courts and tribunals, they are promptly overturned in the Parliament, just as the High Court of Australia should have been overturned in its taxation decisions throughout the 1970s. For that measure which the Government has taken, the Opposition is threatening to vote against that legislation and thereby perpetuate the rort about which they profess to be concerned. It has revealed the Waste Watch stunt for the exercise in humbug and hypocrisy that it is.</PARA>

I am aware of its latest claim, which supposedly is an exposure of some scandal alleged to have taken place in workers compensation payments to Commonwealth Government employees caused by poor attention to safety and employee rip-offs. As far as the Australian National Railways Commission is concerned, the Minister has been advised that the figures cited are correct. However, I would not want the Senate to draw from that the conclusion that the statements made by the Waste Watch Committee have any foundation. They do not indicate that any employees are engaged in any so-called workers compensation rorts or that the Australian National is not committed to improving safety for employees and for the public generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All that the figures indicate is that by the nature of their occupation Australian National employees, who are mainly engaged in duties on the track in very dusty conditions, handling trains in shunting areas or using heavy machinery in engineering workshops, obviously are more at risk from injury than are, say, clerks or tellers in other government instrumentalities, such as the Commonwealth Bank. These conditions cause a high incidence of minor eye injuries and loss of hearing claims common to anybody who works in such industrial environments. Australian National has a better workers compensation track record than most other public instrumentalities which offer a better comparison than the clerical work force of Commonwealth departments and authorities. Therefore, in response to the question asked of me by Senator Elstob, the Government says, and the evidence is there to prove it, that the claim that the Australian National and its employees are abusing the workers compensation system is without substance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen details of the proposal of the Minister for Health that we should have a measles free Australia by the Bicentenary in 1988. I think that Senator Crowley would agree that this is a terribly important matter. There has been tendency in the past in this country to believe that measles is a minor disease with no serious complications, whereas, as she knows and as Senator Peter Baume and those of us who are medical practitioners know, and as others know, it is in fact a very serious disease, because the short term complications of measles, particularly respiratory infections, present a very severe threat to life. The long term complications, particularly the neurological complications, cause great difficulties. Therefore, governments of all persuasions in this country have encouraged people to have vaccination against measles, and I believe we have succeeded to a certain extent, except as Senator Crowley has implied, there is a tendency for people, once the incidence decreases considerably, to forget about this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The world has been successful so far in wiping out smallpox. We should be successful in our community in wiping out measles, but we can only do this by continuous immunisation.

I think that the program announced by my colleague Dr Blewett, and by the State governments, will result in us being successful in this regard, but we will be successful only if we can change the community attitude. I think there is sufficient evidence that the community attitude is changing and that we will be successful in having universal immunisation, and that being so, I look forward to 1988 indeed being a measles free year, but also all the decades after that being the same.</PARA>

<PARA> I do recognise that school principals and school counsellors are conscious of the need to inform students of this eligibility, but from my own experiences in travelling around the countryside and speaking to students and teachers in schools and to parents, I believe that there is still room for more take-up of this benefit if information is more readily available. For this reason my Department, in co-operation with John Dawkins's Office of Youth Affairs, is planning further information campaigns to encourage further inquiries about this level of assistance. It is now considerable. We have increased the secondary allowance several times. It is now $35 a week at the full rate and further increases are planned, which will bring it to the same level as the youth dole within a couple of years, which is a most desirable development, as I am sure all honourable senators will agree. But at $35 a week it is now a substantial amount of assistance to a student from a poorer family, or to the parent in the case where it is payable to the parent. I hope all honourable senators will be aware of this increased rate and, in their contacts with students and teachers, point out that it is available.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to the part of Senator Zakharov's question as to the eligibility for this benefit of students living in the Territories, the secondary allowance scheme applies to Christmas Island, but not to Cocos (Keeling) Islands nor to Norfolk Island. The reason for this policy is that the locals of the two islands concerned-that is, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Norfolk Island-are not Australian citizens and not taxpayers. Both of those conditions are met on Christmas Island.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that in general the answer to the question has to be no. I take up particularly Mr Noakes's point that while employers may be making cash outlays superannuation will be paid for by all Australians. In a sense, that is true, but it is a grossly inadequate interpretation of the facts, because the underlying rationale of the superannuation case is that at least a portion of the increased output accruing through higher productivity would be taken in the form of superannuation but in lieu of a claim for higher wages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important, particularly from the employers' perspective, that if the figure, be it 2 per cent or 3 per cent, were the same for either a payment to a superannuation fund or an increase in wages, the superannuation fund payment is, by a significant margin-something like 16 per cent I believe-a cheaper alternative for the employer than a wages claim of the same amount, because there are on-costs for wages, rises which do not apply to superannuation. It also should be noted that superannuation, as it exists now, is very much the preserve of the well off, a fact which, it would appear, does not worry Mr Noakes and his present employers very much.</PARA>
<PARA> The tax expenditures on superannuation, principally through the exemption of income earned within funds from company or personal taxation, cost more than $3 billion a year. It is growing and it is primarily assisting high income earning males. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that 73 per cent of those earning $520 a week and over-that is, more than $27,000 a year-have superannuation, compared with only 23 per cent of those earning less that $320 a week, or about $16,000 a year and that only 40 per cent of the total work force is involved in superannuation funds. As the figures show, the benefits are very heavily skewed at present in favour of people in the upper salary levels.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad Senator Haines has asked me a question about dolphins. It is a change from all of those questions she asks about economic growth, interest rates, wages, inflation and so on. In response, I am advised by the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Kerin, that the figure of 3,000 was based on research carried out some years ago when 30 or 40 vessels were operating. Since there are now only 16, it is reasonable to assume that the figure is very much less than that. The Taiwanese gill net fishermen are catching tuna, shark and so on, as Senator Haines said, and have been doing so since 1974.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, regarding objections by the Australian industry per se, there have been none, although some individuals have expressed personal opposition. The Minister has indicated quite clearly in parliament and elsewhere to fishing principals that he will be seeking to stop the accidental netting of dolphins.

Finally, all Commonwealth fisheries management, including foreign fishing arrangements, is based on the concept of sustainable yield and stock conservation, and the gill net fishery is no exception to that broad objective or goal.</PARA>

I also refer the Minister to Press statements in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Daily Telegraph this morning which indicate that the Government has completely rejected the provision of university facilities in this area, in which more and more citizens are recognising the need for better education facilities. Has the Government rejected the notion of university facilities for the residents of the western and south-western suburbs of Sydney? What is the Government's response to the Tertiary Education Commission's report?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the question from Senator Richardson on, firstly, the Tertiary Education Commission's response to advocacy for a university in the western suburbs and, secondly, the response of our Government. Of course, the two things are not identical. I welcome the question because there has been quite a lot of misrepresentation in the media as to the issues involved-as to CTEC's advice and as to our Government's position. There has been no closing of the door on the concept of a university for the western suburbs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was pleased to see that the CTEC advice included a proposal for the development of university level studies in the western suburbs, preferably by means of a university college of one of the existing leading universities in New South Wales. Although there will be very careful examination of both the Parry committee's report, which was a report to the State Government of New South Wales, and CTEC's advice to use, by our Government in consultation with the State Government, I can indicate at this stage that it is certainly the intention of our Government to improve higher education opportunities in the western suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly true that the western suburbs have been disadvantaged in terms of educational facilities, mainly because of poor planning decisions taken by previous New South Wales Governments-I hasten to add that I do not include the Wran Government. Anyone who knows New South Wales will agree that the siting of Macquarie University was not sensible in view of the growth areas out in the west. Macquarie University should have been sited in the west, but we cannot wipe out history or change what is. We are operating at a time when there are enormous demands on the higher education budget-legitimate demands coming from many parts of Australia where there is inadequate access to higher education, both colleges of advanced education and universities.</PARA>
<PARA> We are conscious that in the past the western suburbs have been neglected and that they do need more opportunities for higher education. Indeed it has been the policy of our Government, acting on very strong advice from the Tertiary Education Commission, to develop the two CAEs currently operating in the western suburbs-that is, the Hawkesbury Agricultural College and the Nepean CAE. Hawkesbury Agricultural College is a college of great prestige in New South Wales but until recently it has been narrow in the range of training that it offers. We are working with Hawkesbury to increase the range of courses, to bring in business and technology courses and things of that kind. Nepean CAE, which is one of the newest CAEs in NSW, is also receiving developmental and expansion funds from us. Those two developments will continue, but at the same time we must address the legitimate demands by the communities in the western suburbs of Sydney for some access to university level courses in that area. Of course, students from the western suburbs can and do find places in Sydney University, in the University of New South Wales and, indeed, in Macquarie University, but there is no doubt that they are at a geographical disadvantage in doing so and that they would benefit from facilities in the western suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time I am sure that Senator Richardson is aware that there is a primary problem in the west in that participation rates in upper secondary years are very poor. They are the poorest in the State and among the poorest in the nation. At a time when we are planning for the provision of university level courses in the west, we must also seriously address the problem of low participation rates. If we were able to provide university level facilities in the west, but did nothing about participation rates in the outer western suburbs, those new places would not be taken substantially by students in the western suburbs, they would be taken by students from more advantaged parts of Sydney in terms of secondary education. Thus we have a complex range of issues to address. I believe that we will address them constructively with the co-operation of the New South Wales Government. Just last evening I had a constructive meeting with the New South Wales Minister for Education, Rodney Cavalier, and the chancellors and vice-chancellors of the three universities--</PARA>

We are open to discussion and negotiation with New South Wales and we will seriously consider CTEC's advice, which is basically very constructive advice although it goes in a different direction from the Parry committee's recommendations.

The Centre was established in response to an expressed need within the Arab and Moslem community in Melbourne for such a facility, and the departure of the Libyan-based Director does not remove that need. The remaining staff of the Centre are Australian citizens. The Government will not therefore be pursuing the question of closure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Reid asked a question concerning waiting times for nursing home accommodation in the Australian Capital Territory, as well as some problems associated with the privately owned Morling Lodge Nursing Home. The Minister has advised me that he is aware of waiting times for nursing home accommodation in the Australian Capital Territory and has provided the following response:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government recently announced approval for 60 additional nursing home beds in Canberra which is expected to have a significant effect on waiting times. The industrial dispute at the Morling Lodge Nursing Home is regrettable and obviously does nothing to assist the plight of those people requiring nursing home care. Morling Lodge is a private nursing home operated by the Baptist Homes Trust and neither the Government nor the Australian Capital Territory Health Authority are a party to the award covering private nursing home employees.</PARA>
<PARA>If Senator Reid is not satisfied with the response from the Minister for Territories, I suggest that she may require that a question be placed with the Minister responsible for industrial affairs in respect of the later aspect of the question. The Minister for Territories is not able to comment because it is a private matter between another authority and the unions concerned.</PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The delay in the enactment of the Veterans' Entitlements Bill and the Veterans' Entitlements (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill has necessitated the making of amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill. Consequential amendments are now required, in particular, in relation to the date of application of particular provisions of the new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Veterans' Entitlements (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill is still before the Parliament, it is only possible to alter that Bill, in conformity with the Governor-General's message, to deal with the date of its commencement. It has been necessary, therefore, to introduce this separate Bill to deal with other required amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 3 of the Bill gives effect to the Government's undertaking that the dependants of incapacitated Veterans who, prior to 6 June 1985, were receiving a pension in respect of that incapacity, would have the option of commuting their fortnightly payments to a once-only lump sum representing three years' instalments. The Bill gives a period of 6 months from the commencement date to make an election to commute. This amendment maintains the six month period of election. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 will make a new provision in respect of the application of the Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions to decisions assessing the rate of pension payable to a Veteran made after the commencement of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Under clause 5, the Repatriation Commission will be bound to use the Guide in all assessment cases determined after 1 November 1986. However, it may be used before that date if sufficient information is available to enable its use. The Commission will be required to state in its decision that the Guide was used in a particular case. Where the Guide has been applied by the Repatriation Commission, the Veterans' Review Board and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal must apply the Guide when conducting a review of an assessment determination. Under clause 7 similar amendments will be made to the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill will extend the time for lodging an application for review to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, in respect of a Veterans' Review Board entitlement decision, to three months after the commencement of the Veterans' Entitlements (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill. This provision will give effect to a Government undertaking to provide for appeals, under the VEB, against decisions made since 6 June 1985 on the amended standard of proof. The provision is necessary because, in many cases, the three month appeal period under the Repatriation Act will have expired. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's undertaking on provision of rights of review also related to applications for review of decisions from the first level of the repatriation determining system, that is, from the Repatriation Commission to the Veterans' Review Board. However, no legislative action is required as, at the date of commencement, there will in all cases be an unexpired portion of the twelve months' period already prescribed for the lodgment of applications for review to the Veterans' Review Board. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also make further amendments to the Public Service Act 1922 and the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 consequential on the amendment of the Veterans' Entitlements Bill to enable Defence Force personnel to be deemed to have been allotted for service by instrument in writing issued by the Minister for Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also makes amendments to the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940 to parallel those the Government will be moving to the Veterans Entitlements Bill arising from the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 October 1985 (Hansard, pages 774 to 775), Senator Michael Baume asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, the following question without notice concerning seminars:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where will the line be drawn in deciding which functions involving meals are deductible and which are not?</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The question of drawing the line between business lunches and seminar meals is addressed in the legislation enacted to give effect to the new entertainment expense rules. For this purpose the legislation ensures that the cost of meals forming part of a seminar can qualify for deduction only in relation to ``eligible seminars''.</PARA>
<PARA> To qualify as an eligible seminar for these purposes the seminar must have a duration of at least 4 hours, excluding any time spent over meals and recreation breaks. A seminar that takes place solely over the course of a meal (for example, a luncheon address) would not qualify as an eligible seminar.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 October 1985 (Hansard, page 900), Senator Reid asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How many new staff will be put on the Compliance area of the Australian Taxation Office to check whether expenses claimed under other categories are in fact for entertainment? In light of the difficulties admitted by the Minister in answer to Senator Michael Baume yesterday and his answer to Senator Messner today, will there be a Taxation Office official at seminars and conventions to see literally what people eat and drink and under what circumstances they do so?</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that the Australian Taxation Office's internal examination of tax returns together with standard auditing practices will be structured to detect claims made for deduction of entertainment expenses however described.</PARA>
<PARA> Because money spent on business entertainment up to 19 September 1985 can continue to be claimed as a deduction in 1985-86 tax returns, the Commissioner has also advised that staff resources will be set aside to ensure that such expenses were incurred before 20 September 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> A specific additional staff allocation for the Australian Taxation Office has been proposed following enactment of the entertainment expense legislation. The question of staff resources necessary to ensure the appropriate implementation of tax reform measures generally is currently under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of drawing the line between business lunches and seminar meals, the honourable senator should refer to my answer to the question raised by Senator Michael Baume on 8 October 1985.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the purpose of identifying statutory authorities within my portfolio the definition of a statutory authority used by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations has been applied.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Two</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (i) The Superannuation Fund Investment Trust (SFIT) (ii) The Australian Government Retirement Benefits Office (AGRBO)</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There are no specific appeal provisions in the Superannuation Act 1976 in so far as the Act relates to SFIT. Nevertheless, SFIT is subject to general administrative law such as the Ombudsman Act, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, etc. as well as the normal legal processes through the courts.</PARA>
<PARA> Regarding AGRBO, however, in addition to remedies at common law, the following avenues of appeal are available to persons aggrieved by an action of the Commissioner for Superannuation:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Superannuation Act provides that a person who is affected by, and dissatisfied with, a reviewable decision may, within 30 days after first becoming aware of the decision (or within such further period as the Commissioner allows) by notice in writing containing reasons, request the Commissioner to reconsider the decision;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Superannuation Act also provides that applications may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) for review of reviewable decisions that may have been confirmed or varied on reconsideration by the Commissioner;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act provides that an appeal to the Federal Court can be made on a question of law arising out of an AAT decision;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (AD(JR) Act) entitles a person aggrieved by an administrative decision taken under the Superannuation Act 1976 to seek an order for review of the decision in the Federal Court on grounds specified in the AD(JR) Act; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the Commissioner for Superannuation is an ``agency'' for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act (FOI) and all requests for documents and amendment to personal records are considered by him or his delegate under the provisions of the FOI Act. Applications may also be made to the AAT for review of decisions taken by the commissioner or his delegate under the FOI Act and an appeal to the Federal Court can be made on a question of law arising out of an FOI AAT decision.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Attorney-General's Department has advised that, unless an authority is statutorily protected, it is liable for the torts of its servants committed in the course of their duty. Where employees, acting in the course of their duty are incompetent and, as a consequence, loss is suffered by a member of the public, it will commonly be found that the act or omission which was seen as incompetent was also tortious. In the absence of a denial of liability the negligent giving of erroneous advice is tortious where the advice is given by a person having a duty of care to one who suffers foreseeable damage as a result of reasonably relying on that advice. Many other forms of incompetence would also be tortious, but each case would need to be considered on its own facts. Neither of the Authorities listed in answer to part (2) of this question is statutorily protected against general liability in tort.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, pursuant to Section 29 of the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust is a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal and ``may sue and be sued'' in its corporate name.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) There are no such cases concerning SFIT. AGRBO has at present 27 requests for review by the AAT on hand. The average length of time between the receipt of a case by the AAT and its hearing by the AAT for cases heard over the past six months has been approximately 29 weeks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) One.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Commissioner for Employees' Compensation.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The function of the Commissioner under the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 is to determine matters and questions arising under the Act. Where a determination by the Commissioner is made under the Act, an application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the determination by or on behalf of a party to the determination. No other person may make such an application, and there are no appeal mechanisms available to the general public to lodge a complaint against the Commissioner. The Commonwealth Ombudsman may also investigate complaints concerning the administration of the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) None. However, the Governor-General may terminate the appointment of the Commissioner for inefficiency, misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity. The officers of the Australian Public Service employed in the Office of the Commissioner are officers of the Department of Social Security and are subject to normal disciplinary procedures under the Public Service Act and Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Attorney-General's Department has advised that, unless an authority is statutorily protected, it is liable for the torts of its servants committed in the course of their duty. Where employees, acting in the course of their duty are incompetent and, as a consequence, loss is suffered by a member of the public, it will commonly be found that the act or omission which was seen as incompetent was also tortious. For example, incompetent driving would probably be tortious. In the absence of a denial of liability the negligent giving of erroneous advice is tortious where the advice is given by a person having a duty of care to one who suffers foreseeable damage as a result of reasonably relying on that advice. Many other forms of incompetence would also be tortious, but each case would need to be considered on its own facts. The Commissioner for Employees' Compensation is not statutorily protected against general liability in tort.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) As at 31 December 1985, 147 applications for review of a determination of the Commissioner were before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Tribunal lists all applications for review of the Commissioner's determination for hearing within 28 weeks of the date of application. In practice, however, a matter is often settled by agreement between the parties involved before the date of hearing. In some cases hearings are delayed as a result of difficulties in securing appointments with medical specialists and other expert witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Commissioner for Employees' Compensation can be sued.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Do consultations take place between the appropriate Officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Qantas, concerning the depiction of international boundaries of the flight guide maps published by Qantas in its ``Inflight'' magazine; if so, do the boundaries of Israel currently portrayed by Qantas on its maps represent the policy of the Australian Government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I assume the honourable senator is referring to the March/April 1986 edition of the Qantas magazine Airways. The depiction of Israel on the map in the edition is so small that it is not possible to determine with any accuracy where its boundaries are drawn. The map identifies Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Although there is no legend to the map, Jerusalem is marked in a way which could be taken as indicating that it is the capital of Israel.</PARA>
<PARA> Consultations do not take place between officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Qantas concerning the depiction of international boundaries or other features on Qantas flight guide maps. I am advised that Qantas' magazine Airways is produced under contract to a private publisher.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The boundaries of Israel recognised under Australian Government policy do not include Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or the territories occupied by Israel in 1967. The Australian Government does not recognise the law passed by the Israeli Knesset in July 1980 which declared Jerusalem, including East Jerusalem, to be the undivided capital of Israel. Nor does it recognise the annexation of the Golan Heights in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> I would also note that the map contains a number of other inaccuracies. In respect of Africa the map identifies the so-called `independent homelands' of Bophuthatswana, Venda, Transkei and Kwazulu, as separate States. Neither Australia nor any other member of the international community accords recognition to the so-called homelands as independent States. The map also needs to reflect the fact that Upper Volta is now called Burkino Faso. I will arrange to have these matters and other minor inaccuracies drawn to the attention of Qantas.</PARA>
