<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Upon evidence from within Australia and overseas, the introduction of Plant Variety Rights legislation would not be in Australia's best interests because:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Plant genetic resources should remain a public resource;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Australia's public plant breeding programmes could be undermined;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Such legislation may lead to a reduction in the genetic diversity of commercial varieties;</PARA>
<PARA> 4. There is reason to fear that choices of seed and other plant propagation materials may be restricted due to the controls placed on their use;</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Plant Varietal Rights legislation could lead to higher costs for the grower, the consumer, the plant-breeder and the tax-payer;</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Plant Variety Rights will lead to a further increase in foreign control of Australia's plant genetic resources;</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Parliament ensure that it recognises the widespread public opposition to PVR and promote alternative means of royalty collection for plant breeders.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In leading for the Opposition I indicate that the Opposition will support the Bounty (Books) Bill 1986, although in the Committee stage of the consideration of the Bill we propose to advance two amendments. It is probably true to say that books have always received some sort of government subsidy or protection, some form of positive encouragement by way of financial incentive. The first book printed in English by Caxton in 1477 was printed only with assistance in the form of patronage of Margaret of Burgundy. The provision of financial assistance for books has been continued ever since. Support of book production by way of bounty was first notified to the Parliament in May 1969 when the then Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr McEwen, made a ministerial statement indicating that the Government was intending to introduce a system of paying bounty to Australian book manufacturers, pending what was the first inquiry into book production by the then Tariff Board. On that occasion Mr McEwen said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This decision was taken because increasing numbers of books are being printed for Australian publishers in overseas countries. The loss of business to Australian printers has caused serious damage to the domestic book printing and binding industry. Employment has fallen significantly and the Government is convinced on the evidence that this trend will continue unless immediate action is taken. </PARA>
<PARA>In September 1969 the then Minister for the Interior, Mr Nixon, introduced the first Book Bounty Bill. The amount of bounty paid on books is fairly significant. The table that appears in the latest annual report of the Industries Assistance Commission shows that book bounty is one of the four or five largest bounties paid under all the bounty and subsidy payments made in Australia. I seek leave to incorporate the table in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. A number of the individual payments under the book bounty legislation are significant. For instance, the firm of McPherson's, which is located largely in the electorate of my colleague in the other place, Mr Julian Beale, receives an annual bounty payment in excess of $3m. Griffin Press in South Australia receives a bounty payment in excess of $1.5m. The major publishers of law books and journals receive quite substantial amounts. The figures tabled last week in the annual returns under the book bounty legislation show for instance that Butterworths Pty Ltd received some $160,000, CCH Australia Ltd some $551,000, and the Methuen law book company some $154,000. So substantial payments are made by way of subsidy to publishers of law books and law journals and no doubt make a significant contribution to keeping costs within reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The subject of book bounty and book production in Australia was referred to the Industries Assistance Commission some time ago. On 20 December 1985 the IAC issued its report No. 377. The Commission said in describing the way in which the bounty operates:</PARA>
<PARA> In general, all categories of books are bountiable, except periodicals, advertising, Australian directories guides and timetables, books of less than 49 printed pages (with the exception of casebound books, and of text books and children's picture books of 16 pages or more), and books of which less than 1,000 copies are printed. Bounty, where payable, is currently at the rate of 25 per cent of the price (net of bounty) paid or payable to the book manufacturer by the publisher. </PARA>
<PARA>The IAC after conducting this quite exhaustive inquiry into the industry made the following recommendations:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission considers that the bounty rate should be reduced to 20 per cent from 1 January 1987. The corresponding rate for paper supplied free of charge by publishers to printers would be sixteen and two-thirds per cent. Bounty eligibility should be extended to Australian directories, guides, street directories, road guides and the like under reference, excluding telephone directories and classified buyers guides. Customs duties on those books to which bounty eligibility is extended should be set at minimum levels.</PARA>
<PARA> Customs duties on other books currently dutiable at protective rates should be set at 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall come back subsequently to that recommendation about the Customs duty on imported books. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in a Press statement issued on 20 August 1986 indicated the preliminary acceptance of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendations. Senator Button said that the new scheme would operate from 1 January 1987 until 30 June 1989. The Press statement stated:</PARA>
<PARA> While accepting most of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendations on book production, the Government had decided to reduce the Industries Assistance Commission recommended bounty rate in line with its budget decision to reduce bounties generally and thus reduce expenditure outlays. The new rates should be sufficient to ensure continued local book production following some improvements in local competitiveness as a result of the devaluation of the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new scheme, eligible books would be paid a bounty of 16 per cent of the printer's net selling price (the selling price less the bounty) from 1 January 1987. Where publishers supplied paper free to printers for production of bountiable books the bounty rate under the new scheme would be 13.8 per cent of the publisher's material cost. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government decided to go even further than the Industries Assistance Commission had recommended in terms of the reduction of the bounty from 25 per cent, beyond the 20 per cent recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission to 16 per cent, and make a similar reduction where publishers were operating on paper which had been supplied free to them. The Budget decision announcing a 20 per cent across the board cut in bounty protection then placed the printing industry in the position of facing a potential double whammy, as it has been described, or in other words a reduction of bounty in line with Industries Assistance Commission recommendations plus a reduction of bounty in line with the Government's across the board decision to reduce the general rate of bounty assistance being provided. </PARA>
<PARA> It was perfectly true that the industry looked at the prospect of having a very large reduction, a sudden reduction, to take effect from January 1987, and was certainly very concerned that its economic position would be substantially jeopardised by that two-stage reduction. It made representations to the Government and to the Opposition and made its position known publicly. On 20 November 1986, in response to its complaints, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce put out a further Press release which indicated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government had decided to defer a reduction in the rate of book bounty . . . The reduction was announced on 20 August 1986 following the Government's consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission Report on Book Production.</PARA>
<PARA> The deferral has been on the basis that a further cut in the book bounty, on top of the 20 per cent cut in bounties generally, which was announced in the Budget, would cause adjustment problems for the industry . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In reaching its decision the Government noted the industry view that a deferral of the cut would bring significant benefits in the form of more printing of books in Australia and additional exports. The cost of deferring the reduction would be about $1.6m in 1986-87. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a decision which the Opposition very much welcomes. It is a correct decision and it is now reflected in the legislation. We believe, on that basis, that the legislation is worthy of our support. However, there are now a number of matters dealing with the administration of the bounty and a number of other issues which arise from the second reading speech of the Minister for Community Services (Senator Grimes) on which I seek some further information from the Minister when he is in a position to reply when concluding the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's second reading speech draws attention to the fact that the Australian Government is not a signatory to the Florence agreement which precludes the imposition of tariffs on books containing educational, scientific or cultural material. The Florence agreement-more properly known as the Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials-which was open for signature at Lake Success, New York, on 22 November 1950 and which was subsequently amended by the Nairobi Protocol which was attached to the convention provides generally that there ought to be the freest flow of books and publications of educational, scientific and cultural material. Article 1 of the convention provides:</PARA>
<PARA>The contracting States undertake not to apply customs duties or other charges on, or in connection with, the importation of: (a) books, publications and documents, listed in Annex A to this Agreement . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to deal specifically with internal taxes that may be levied, such as sales tax, value added taxes and so on, but generally it attempts to establish a regime where there is a minimum amount of financial penalty on imported books. A question was asked of the Minister for Science (Mr Barry Jones) in the House of Representatives on 14 May 1985 by Mr Peacock. Mr Jones said:</PARA>
<PARA> I said that I thought it was unthinkable that a tax on books would be imposed in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless I am concerned about whether the Australian Government has given consideration to becoming a contracting party to the Florence agreement. If it has, what stage have any discussions or considerations reached? If it has not, is there any particular reason why it has decided not to become a signatory to the Florence agreement?</PARA>
<PARA> The second point that arises is that I do not believe that the Government has really clearly addressed the question of whether the Industries Assistance Commission was entirely correct in deciding to recommend the extension of the bounty to the production of various guides and directories. Certainly, this has been a vexatious problem by way of definition of what constitutes a guide or directory. There was a very significant case involving a publication by the National Trust in which the application of the bounty or the eligibility for bounty turned upon the question of whether the publication should be classified as a guide, a directory or a book within the traditional meaning of the term `book' which was laid down by a High Court decision in Ambascol Press v. the Director of Posts and Telegraphs (NSW). Therefore, I am anxious to ask the Minister whether the extension to guides and directories is being undertaken in the Act simply because it is too difficult to determine on every occasion what constitutes a guide or directory; or whether this is part of a larger government decision to extend the eligibility across a far greater range of publications. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, can the Minister explain why the Government has decided that it will deny the bounty to books published by the Australian Government Publishing Service and books required to be published or printed by State or Territory government printers after 1 January 1987? Although the reason given is that Government publications are usually printed in Australia, and therefore not subject to competition from overseas printers, will this, in fact, lead to a substantial increase in the cost to the public of government publications? In its amendments to the Freedom of Information Act, the Government has already indicated that it is quite unconcerned about making information more costly to members of the public. It increased the charges under the Freedom of Information Act and I have seen a report today showing that the number of inquiries under the Act has fallen substantially in the last year because of the Government's active discouragement of people making use of FOI. I am very concerned about whether the exclusion of government directories and publications from the book bounty legislation will lead to a substantial increase in the cost of these publications and the cost of information to the public, and whether the Government is deliberately setting out on that course.</PARA>
<PARA> I am also anxious to ask why the Government has not accepted the IAC report to reduce duties on imported books. The Minister, in his second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided that import duties on books currently dutiable at a general rate of 25 per cent will remain unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA>The Industries Assistance Commission recommended that the rate come down from 25 per cent to 20 per cent. I am anxious to know why the Government has not picked up that IAC recommendation. It is a matter of very considerable importance because one of the negative effects of the devaluation of the Australian dollar has been to increase substantially the cost of books imported into Australia. This has had a devastating effect upon the Australian library system. As a member of the Parliamentary Library Committee I know that we have had evidence presented to us by the Parliamentary Librarian of the enormous impact that will be made on the Library's capacity to purchase books and journals from the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe. As a member of Estimates Committee D, I heard at length from the Librarian of the National Library of Australia about the enormous impact this is having on that library and others in terms of the cost to them of having to face the consequences of the devaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very negative impact upon the process of technology transfer into Australia. Most technology transfer into Australia occurs by way of the purchase of books and journal material. The enormous increase which is taking place in the cost of imported books and journals, which will have a long term negative impact upon our capacity to make the best of technology transfer arrangements, could, in part, have been offset if the Government had decided to accept the IAC recommendation and reduce the duty on imported books from 25 per cent to 20 per cent. I want to know why it is that that was not undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point is that I express a degree of dissatisfaction with the way in which the book bounty is administered by the Department. On 24 March 1986 I obtained from the Australian Customs Service a review of the appeals against decisions to withhold the book bounty. If one looks through those details one sees that in the Butterworths case the Administrative Appeals Tribunal overruled the Customs Service decision and indicated that a work comprising more than one volume may be eligible for bounty. In the Australian National University case a substantial question arose because there had been different printing forms and different binding arrangements. On a run of 1,000 books where 507 copies were hard bound and 493 were bound in soft cover, the Department tried to deny the bounty because the 1,000 books were not bound the same way. The AAT set aside that decision. It also set aside a significant decision involving Pap Printers and Publishers Pty Ltd which went through to the Federal Court. A case involving the National Trust of Australia (New South Wales) went through to the Federal Court where the AAT's decision against the Department was upheld. In a recent case involving an applicant by the name of Hawkins which came before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Tribunal said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the fact that bounty was paid in respect of the books tendered in evidence-</PARA>
<PARA>when in fact they may not have been eligible books-</PARA>
<PARA>reveals an inconsistency in the administration of the Act which causes us considerable concern. </PARA>
<PARA>Elsewhere, the AAT said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Department-Mr Holloway, who represented the respondent-acknowledged that the Act had been administered inconsistently . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am concerned that there is a considerable amount of evidence about the quite inconsistent administration of this Act by the Department. I believe that this needs substantial attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I raise in terms of seeking information is that the book bounty legislation provides that a bounty will not be paid upon certain types of books which might be classified as pornographic. In October 1979 I raised this matter at some length in the Senate, indicating the extent to which the bounty was then being paid upon pornographic publications. Amendments to the Act were introduced following pressure by the honourable member for Berowra, Dr Harry Edwards, and me on the then coalition Government. Changes were made so that a book could be classified in such a way that, if it had been sought to be imported, it would have fallen foul of the then regulation 4a of the Customs Prohibited Import Regulations and the Attorney-General's Department could have been asked by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce whether in its opinion a book was classified as prohibited. If that had been the case, the bounty would not have been paid on the book. I asked the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce on 25 February 1985 the number of books that had been denied bounty under the then section 8 of the old Act in terms of the classification of books. The Minister provided me with some information. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a copy of the question and the answer provided by the Minister on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>(Question No. 34)</PARA>

<PARA> Senator Puplick asked the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 25 February 1985:</PARA>

<PARA> (3) On how many occasions did the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce make use of the provisions of sub-section 8 (5) of the Act to seek external advice on the determination of applications referred to in (1) above; and to which bodies did the Minister refer such matters for advice. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) How many applications for a review of the Minister's decisions not to grant payment on the grounds set out in Section 8 (other than sub-section 8 (2)) were made in each of the last five years, and how many of such appeals (if any) were upheld. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) Is bounty under the Act payable on items which may offend certain provisions of State legislation but which do not in any way offend any provisions of Commonwealth or Territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) For the purposes of sub-section 8 (1) of the Act does ``a law of a Territory'' apply to all the laws of the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. This reveals that we are talking only about 19 applications which have been knocked back on the ground that the book was prohibited. The regime which is now transferred into paragraph 5 (1) (s) of the new legislation continues this process but I am anxious to know from the Department how many books in the last year or so have been denied the bounty on the ground that they were prohibited within the meaning of the Act. I note that 53 items were referred to during the previous period to which I have just referred. However, only one had been put to the Attorney-General's Department for external advice. I am anxious to know whether bounty continues to be paid on books which one sees in the shops which appear to me generally to fall into the category of pornographic publications. I do not seek to make any pronouncement on pornography or to deny that in certain cases there may be therapeutic benefits from such material; my only concern is whether public revenues are being used to support publication of these books through the operation of the book bounty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have raised six specific questions: The Florence agreement; the extension to guides and directories; the exclusion of government publications; the failure to reduce import duties; the administrative difficulties and inconsistencies within the Department; and the regime in place in relation to prohibited books. Support for this legislation is forthcoming from the Opposition. I indicated at the outset that, to my knowledge, books have always been subject to a degree of government support. Senator Grimes, who shares with me an interest in the activities of that great and lamented Plantagenet king, Richard III, will undoubtedly be aware that even in his time there was considerable support for the book and publishing industry. When Richard's parliament enacted a tariff against all imports he amended the legislation in his own hand to provide that there would be no custom duties on those `bringing into this realm or selling by retail or otherwise any manner of books, written or imprinted' and that there was to be no interference with `the inhabiting within the realm of writers or illustrators, binders or printers of such books'. Continuing that fine tradition established by that very fine monarch, the Opposition is happy to support the book bounty legislation. We will move a couple of minor amendments at the Committee stage. Otherwise, I commend the legislation to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, as you will be aware from the second reading speech of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) on the Bounty (Books) Bill 1986, the Government has decided to retain the bounty assistance to Australian book production for the next three years until 30 June 1989. Although the bounty has been reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent of the net selling price, the Government has decided to defer the reduction in bounty rates until the report of the Industries Assistance Commission inquiry into the pulp, paper, paper products and printing industries is delivered in February next year. I congratulate the Government on this move. It allows for better planning than the alternative of having at least four assistance scenarios in less than 12 months, and it is in line with the other well developed industry plans that the Government has already announced for other sectors of manufacturing industry. The other plans include, of course, the steel industry plan, the car industry plan and the heavy engineering package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian book publishing industry is made up of 30 large producers and 80 small producers. Currently they produce only about 40 per cent of locally published works, and account for only $90m out of a possible $225m worth of books published in Australia. The book sector accounts for about 10 per cent of the manufacturing work force in this sector of the manufacturing industry, but the value added component of the industry is a relatively high 12 per cent. Australians have one of the highest literacy rates in the world and this country is one of the highest per capita buyers of books in the world. The room for expansion is enormous. The effects of the devaluation were expected to lift the locally produced figure to $125m in 1987. In 1987 the book industry is looking for increased production in the order of $50m to $60m which, of course, would create another 400 jobs in the book production industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Let there be no doubt that this decision by the Government is a progressive decision. The delay in implementing the cuts in the rate of the bounty will allow those involved in the industry-both the unions and the employers-to investigate the possibility of developing a book industry plan. The Government needs to be congratulated for this, as do the unions and employers, for their willingness to sit down and properly plan this most important industry. Already the participants in the industry have agreed in principle to an outline for such an industry plan. The manufacturers have agreed in principle to reinvest one-third of the moneys received in bounties to improve and modernise plant and equipment. The figures which Senator Puplick cited show the amounts of money that could be reinvested in new plant and machinery in the book publishing and printing field. In return, the unions have agreed to the introduction of new technologies and are prepared to examine working arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that, with reasonable and responsible negotiation on both sides, a book industry plan will be developed that will also incorporate agreements on matters such as industrial democracy and occupational health and safety. As I mentioned previously, the room for expansion within the industry is enormous and with a viable book publishing industry plan we can look forward to expansion of our markets, especially into some markets that have not been developed. Our book printing and binding industry should consider entering the Pacific island states and other countries in this part of the world. I believe the Government has made a correct decision. We will await with interest the further IAC report on the whole industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats, like the Opposition, support the Bounty (Books) Bill 1986. As the Senate is aware, the Australian Democrats opposed the overall 20 per cent cut in bounty rates earlier in the week under the Bounty and Subsidy Legislation Amendment Bill. Therefore, support for this legislation is important in terms of the book industry, which would have suffered what has already been termed a double whammy under that legislation-legislation which, at the time, we said was shortsighted and was a deterrent to industry's ability to be able to plan ahead for investment, and to stability in industry generally. We were unsuccessful in our opposition to that general cut with the Opposition paying lip service to our position but not supporting it with its vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We recognise, as does everybody, I think, in this Parliament, the importance of the book industry to Australia, not just in an industrial sense or in an employment sense, but also in a cultural sense. As a relatively small nation, it is very important that we have a viable printing, publishing and binding industry so that our cultural heritage, our own individuality as a nation, is expressed through the print medium. Were it not for a range of support systems and the support of Government for planning and development in the book industry, that viability would certainly be at risk given the possibility of an influx of material from much larger countries such as the United States of America and the United Kingdom, countries which have well and truly been permeated with other aspects of our culture, particularly through the electronic media-television in particular. It is very important that we sustain this industry in Australia. That view has general support. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other aspects of this Bill which are encouraging. Certain aspects tidy up the existing legislation. An example of that is the inclusion of Australian guides and directories. This brings me to the point I was making about support for the industry being seen in the light of our own national identity. It is important, too, that there is no double eligibility for imports for both tariff and bounty. At the Committee stage we will be moving an amendment which reflects the concern, which we expressed in the previous bounty legislation this week in this place, for the provision to appeal decisions. I do not wish to say any more other than that because we see this legislation redressing what might have been an enormous difficulty to the book industry, given the decision on general cuts in bounties, we support the legislation and will be moving an amendment at the Committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes available to me, I want to make a few comments about the Bounty (Books) Bill 1986. This Bill continues the bounty assistance for Australian book production for the next three years to 30 June 1989. In doing so, it replaces the current bounty legislation which terminates on 31 December 1986. It follows the Government's consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission report of December 1985 on book production, the main recommendation of which was that the bounty on eligible books be reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) said in his second reading speech that the Government has accepted the basic thrust of the recommendations of the IAC, but that it has decided to defer the reduction in bounty rates until it has had time to consider the results of the current IAC inquiry on the pulp, paper and paper products and printing industries. However, the Government has gone ahead with the Budget decision to reduce all bounties by 20 per cent, a decision that was announced in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the remarks that Senator Puplick made on behalf of the Opposition in this debate. I want to add to those remarks-and this is my main reason for speaking-my concern about the way in which the Government has gone about this legislation and about the example it provides of inconsistency and indecisiveness in government policy making, particularly in the area of industry policy at a time when the thing that we most need in Australia is consistency. We need stability and predictability in decision making if we expect Australia to become a more productive, investment conscious, and employing economy, particularly in the manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government announced on 20 August its decision to implement the Industries Assistance Commission reports, it had on the preceding day in the Budget announced the 20 per cent cut in bounties. Back on 20 August, when the Minister made his announcement, from which he is now backing away, he knew that there was no logic in making a decision at that time to have an inquiry into the book bounty in isolation from pulp, paper and printing generally. That was all known at the time. The Minister knew on 20 August that the decision announced then-again from which he is backing away in this legislation-doubled the size of the bounty cut in the space of 4 1/2 months. He knew all those things. He knew that it would cause considerable concern in the industry. Yet the Government went ahead on 20 August and announced that decision in relation to the book printing industry. It is an indictment that the Minister took that decision. I accept the validity of his changing that decision. My point is that the decision should never have been made in the first place on 20 August, for all the reasons that he has now given. I make those remarks because the inconsistency and stupidity of much of the approach of the Government to industry policy are of great concern to this side of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank honourable senators for their support, even for those few nasty remarks just made by Senator Short. I have a few matters to reply to from Senator Puplick's contribution. Senator Puplick asked: `Why did the Government deny the bounty on books published by the Australian Government Publishing Service? Will this increase the cost of government publications?'. As has been said, books published by the AGPS are almost always printed by Australian printers and bounty assistance of course is not required to ensure that they are printed in this country. Whilst under this system there will be some additional cost to the customer department, there will be a corresponding reduction in expenditure on bounty payments by the Government. It is expected that this will balance out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As all honourable senators know, the Florence convention requires signatories to remove duties on books, works of art and audio-visual equipment. The Australian Government respects the spirit of the convention with respect to books, but governments of both political persuasions have considered it undesirable to remove protection on audio-visual equipment. Accordingly, governments have felt unable to sign the convention, although, as the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) has made clear in his second reading speech, the Government certainly supports the spirit of the convention with regard to books. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick suggested that the Australian Customs Service has a poor track record in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal relating to the Bounty (Books) Act. As the honourable senator is aware, that Act is administratively an exceedingly complicated piece of legislation. The list of ineligible books under the Act is extensive and the number of administrative decisions required under the Act is very extensive indeed. In view of the number of decisions, the record of the Australian Customs Service before the AAT is pretty good. The few examples noted by the honourable senator, compared with the total number of decisions potentially reviewable, I think are proof of this fact. He also queried why the Government did not reduce duties on imported books in line with the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendation. Book production is only a small part of the printing industry. The assistance to the whole paper and printing industry is currently being reviewed by the IAC. As paper represents a significant input to the book printing industry, the Government considers it appropriate to defer any duty reduction on books until it can consider the industry as a whole. I hope that answers most of the points raised by Senator Puplick. Again I thank honourable senators for their support for the legislation and the speedy passage provided for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>The principal amendment proposes to correct an anomaly in the legislation by including in the Bill a transitional provision to enable payment of bounty on eligible books being produced under the old bounty but not completed until after 31 December 1986. It is the Government's intention that those books continue to be bountiable, under the new arrangements. Accordingly, amendment (2) proposes to insert into the Bill a provision to enable bounty to be paid on books commencing prior to 1 January-that is, the date of the commencement of the new bounty arrangements-but completed after that date. </PARA>
<PARA> In amendment (1) the opportunity has been taken to remove an apparent unintentional effect of clause 4 (5) of the Bill. The amendment proposes to make it clear that the provision of that sub-clause will not have the effect of reducing publishers' paper costs by 16.7 per cent to take account of profit, thereby doubling the reduction in the amount of the bounty. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment (3) proposes the insertion into the Bill of clause 33 (1) (gd). It provides that a decision of the Comptroller on the date on which a person is to be registered under the Bill is to be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The absence of such a provision was brought to the attention of the Government by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in its most recent Alert Digest.

I do not intend to take much time to go through this matter. This is a standard amendment which has been moved by the Opposition. I proposed to quote what Senator Chaney, the Leader of the Opposition, said in discussing the same amendment moved to the Bounty and Subsidy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1986 on 25 November. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that whilst the Government is acting with the best of intentions of trying to avoid fragmentation of Australian industry, it is in fact simply putting in place more bureaucratic interference with industry of a type which, in the past, has, in the end, simply added to costs and to the inflexibility of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, in talking to the Bounty and Subsidy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1986 on 20 November 1986, Senator Chaney said:</PARA>
<PARA> We think the proper course is for the Government to limit entry by ensuring that the competitive pressures are so great that only those people who will be developing an efficient industry will wish to enter. </PARA>
<PARA>On 25 November 1986, in moving the same amendment to the Subsidy (Cultivation Machines and Equipment) Bill 1986, Senator Chaney said:</PARA>
<PARA> In fact we believe that the best way to achieve the orderly development of the industry is to ensure that the levels of assistance provided are not such as to encourage people to enter this industry unless they believe that they can be competitive. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Opposition has consistently maintained that this attempt by the Government to regulate what it calls the orderly development of a particular industry in Australia is not the correct way to bring about rationality in the development of Australian industry and industry policy. We have therefore moved this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As in the previous bounty legislation, I repeat that the Government is unable to accept this amendment. We remain committed to the continued inclusion of the orderly development provisions in their current form as a necessary facility to ensure that bounty assistance is only available to applicants who have a clear long term commitment to the particular industry concerned. Given the monetary limits that are now universally placed on this type of industries assistance, the Government is of the view that unrestricted access to bounty to those who might have only a marginal commitment to the industry is entirely inappropriate. The discretion does not, as has been suggested in this case and in other cases, exclude new entrants to an industry from receiving bounty, nor does it unfairly entrench existing bounty recipients. Provided new entrants are prepared to undertake the necessary commitment to the industry and meet the registration requirements, they will not be denied registration.</PARA></TALK.START>

At page 163 of the report the Committee said:</PARA>

For the sake of consistency, we move this amendment so that there will be no doubt that the directions which are to be given by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce which require a person to answer questions and produce documents under clause 25 (1), where at the moment any time and place could theoretically be notified to the person concerned, the time and place should be defined in the legislation as reasonable.

<PARA>At its Meeting . . . held on 26-27 August 1982, the Commission considered and approved a draft reply to correspondence from the Proportional Representation Society of Australia which had written to the Commission expressing the view that the Australian method of electing Members to the House of Representatives is inconsistent with Article 25 of the ICCPR. The draft was prepared by legal staff of the Commission and may, therefore, be said to contain a legal opinion on that question. </PARA>
<PARA>It is perfectly clear that although the letter may have been prepared by legal staff of the Commission it was in fact considered and approved by the Commission itself. So this was a decision by the existing Human Rights Commission given at the end of August 1982 and conveyed to Mr Wright, the President of the Proportional Representation Society of Australia, by letter dated 1 September 1982 and signed by Mr Thomson on behalf of the Commission. I have already quoted from that letter and I do not want to waste the time of the Committee today by quoting from it again. I therefore seek leave to have the letter incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Wright,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letters of 29 March and 9 May concerning your Society's view that the Australian method of electing members to the House of Representatives is inconsistent with Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly, you seem to be taking issue with the voting process itself, and you then specify three ways in which you believe the electoral system fails to satisfy Article 25. </PARA>
<PARA> We have examined the working papers of the international committee that worked on this Covenant to try to find the exact intent of specific words and phrases. These working papers are recorded in the travaux of the 1096th and 1097th meetings of the Third Committee of the Sixteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and in some annexes and agenda to these meetings. I have enclosed photocopies for your information. The Article 23 referred to is the present Article 25 of the Covenant. </PARA>
<PARA> From these records, it seems clear that the intention of the United Nations General Assembly was that the final form of the Article should make allowance for different electoral systems in various parts of the world. The provisions of Article 23 (then) should have universal significance and be valid for all countries, regardless of their electoral systems. The choice of electoral systems should be left to individual Governments (see paragraphs 11, 18 and 50, and the Annexes: summary of issues discussed). </PARA>
<PARA> The first way in which you say the electoral system fails to meet the requirements of Article 25 is that while sub-paragraph (a) of Article 25 refers to the right of every citizen to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives, some voters, namely those who do not vote for the winning candidate, do not have freely chosen representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Discussion about the sub-paragraph concerned the significance of the word ``directly'' which was taken to mean ``unhindered in their right to stand for election or nominate others''. There was concern that there be plurality of political parties, as this was one way of guaranteeing that representation be ``direct''; but no concern was expressed that every voter should have a freely chosen representative. </PARA>
<PARA> The question would appear to turn upon the meaning of the phrase ``freely chosen''. Clearly having regard to the nature of an election, this cannot mean that every voter shall be represented by the person of his or her choice. In the Commission's view, that phrase means that the process of choosing a representative shall be unfettered. This is, of course, to a significant extent, secured by the concept of secret ballot as well as by the general electoral process obtaining in Australia. This approach is consistent with the discussion mentioned above concerning the significance of the word ``directly''. </PARA>
<PARA> Your second concern was that the words ``universal and equal suffrage'' in sub-paragraph 25 (b) should be taken to mean that each vote should have equal value, and that under the present system of elections, this is not so. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegate from Great Britain raised the question of this interpretation (Agenda Item 28, Part 1, Annexes, Tenth Session, Document A/2910, Addendum 1 to 6, Observations by Governments). Great Britain's note stated that ``the reference to `equal suffrage' might be taken to mean conditions which ensure that every vote has equal weight; the fulfilment of such a requirement might involve the institution of some form of proportional representation, as well as, in many countries, some rationalisation of the size of constituencies''. Great Britain therefore suggested as an amendment the deletion of the words ``shall be by universal and equal suffrage''. However, at the 1096th Meeting of the Third Committee, at which suggested amendments were discussed, the British delegation said they would no longer maintain their amendment, if it were made clear that the word ``equal'' did not imply that ``each vote should be guaranteed identical weight by means of some kind of proportional representation in the electoral system. . . . Each vote carried equal weight in the sense that there was only one vote per person and it was cast for a member . . . who had exactly the same rights and duties as any other member'' (para. 9). The point was emphasised again by the delegates of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (para. 44) and France (para. 50). Subsequent voting indicates that the Committee accepted and agreed with that interpretation of the word ``equal''. The Commission, in the light of that discussion, takes a similar view on the meaning of that word. </PARA>
<PARA> Your third concern was that the words ``guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors'' should be taken to mean that the will of the people should not merely be recorded but also put into effect, and that while the votes of many people are ineffective, this cannot be so. </PARA>
<PARA> There was considerable discussion of the issues involved in sub-paragraph 25 (b), and it was held that ``genuine periodic elections'', ``universal and equal suffrage'' and ``secret ballot'' were the elements of genuine elections which in turn guaranteed the free expression of the will of the electors. Discussion was lengthy, without ever raising the inference that ``free expression'' necessarily involved the ``putting into effect'' of the will of the people. (Paragraphs 4, 26, 31, 49, 55, 59, 73 and 70 refer.) This would not appear to be an inappropriate construction to be placed on sub-paragraph 25 (b). </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the above, there would not appear to be any inconsistency in terms of your letter between the existing process of voting under electoral legislation in Australia and Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Should you wish, however, to take further with the Commission any of the matters discussed above, we should be glad to hear from you. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The position, of course, becomes quite clear when one reads the letter that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wrote to the Australian Democrats on 12 March 1986. This letter, which has also been referred to in the debate, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Specifically I confirm that the Government will ask the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the new commission-</PARA>
<PARA>to inquire into existing State electoral laws. Should the Commission find that Queensland's electoral distribution contravenes the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and should the Queensland Government not agree to reform that distribution, the Commonwealth will legislate pursuant to its external affairs power. </PARA>
<PARA>When that undertaking was given by the Prime Minister which followed undertakings given by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), and by Senator Evans on behalf of the Attorney-General, they must have known or should have known that the existing Human Rights Commission itself had adopted a quite different interpretation of the meaning of `equal suffrage'. This reveals how absolutely hollow was the undertaking that the Government gave on 12 March. I think the Democrats realise now how hollow it was, and this may be one reason why they wanted to cut short the debate the other night. Not only has the Human Rights Commission formed this view but also, as I said, this view was expressed by leading international lawyers in the authoritative work on the International Covenant, titled The International Bill of Rights, which contains a series of articles on the Covenant and which discusses various aspects of it. I do not propose to take time quoting from this work, but I refer honourable senators, if they are interested, to pages 241 to 245, which I have already referred to, and particularly to page 242. That view is expressed there and it has also been expressed recently by a leading Australian constitutional lawyer, Professor Winterton. </PARA>
<PARA> I have absolutely no doubt that on 12 March of this year the Government would have had either advice or opinion from its own constitutional lawyers on the likelihood that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, unless it was stacked by the Government to get that opinion, would accord with the opinion given by the Human Rights Commission and would accord with the current opinion of international lawyers as to what this provision in the covenant means. This has been a totally hollow exercise by the Government. It is clear from what Senator Evans said in the chamber the other night that the Government is backing away from that position as fast as it can. In any event, whatever is decided in this matter, it will clearly be decided by the High Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a whole series of reasons why the Government is not going to succeed in this endeavour that it has embarked upon, including the reasons which Professor Winterton expressed in the interview on the AM program, which I have referred to, when he said that there are other good reasons why the High Court is most unlikely to find against the State and this would probably be held to be discriminatory legislation directed against the State. Clearly the price that the Government is paying for these undertakings, which were given purely to buy the Democrats' support for the Bill of Rights Bill, is becoming more and more devalued over time. I leave it at that for the moment. I want to raise another matter, but perhaps somebody else wishes to speak on this point.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Australian Democrats moved the gag, after consultation with the Australian Labor Party, several nights ago I sought to refresh myself upon their printed statements of principles of action so that they could keep us all honest. I looked, of course, to a main principle, which was: `We will never support a gag'. I wondered then at the convolution or perversion of morality of a party which, of course, quite naturally is now disintegrating because, as Senator Siddons said, the party is a party of a collection of single issues, most of them conflicting, and indeed living off the peckings of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot think of anything more hypocritical than the gag move. But, reflecting on it, it became abundantly clear because, if there was one thing that was absolutely necessary, it was to try to gag the substance of the material that Senator Durack has just revealed. Here was not just sublime hypocrisy by the Democrats-we are used to that every day of our lives-but a complete exposure of hypocrisy by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his Government. It is now patently clear from the words of the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Gareth Evans), who is in the chamber, that, when the Prime Minister wrote that letter to the Democrats making a bargain with the Democrats so that the Democrats would vote for the Australian Bill of Rights Bill, the Prime Minister knew that what he was saying was substantially untrue. He new that he could not deliver it. He knew that the very body, the Human Rights Commission, had put in writing that it did not believe that it had the power to carry out the very investigation that he was making a bargain to deliver. There cannot be anything more hypocritical than that. It is just one more exposure, along with the exposure today of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), of the abject hypocrisy of people who preach one thing and practise an entirely different code of morality. We also saw it last night when we examined the Estimates of the Department of the Special Minister of State and I exposed the fact that there had been no change at all in the instructions to the Department about the enforcement of the interpretation of `principal place of residence'. It was just a different attitude of mind that had come forward.</PARA>
<PARA> Here we have a situation in which the Government knew, and its advisers knew, that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights contained no head of power to enforce one vote one value. They knew from the working agreements, the travaux, which are all documented behind that Covenant, that country after country said that it would not sign the Covenant if the concept of one vote one value were included. In fact, it was therefore worded so that it was one vote one person and not one vote one value. All that was known. It was known that that head of power could not be used to pursue that. </PARA>
<PARA> But it was worse than that. The Government wanted to take a cheap trick against the Queensland Government, simply because that Government is not of its faith. It almost failed to notice that a Labor Government in the west was also vulnerable in terms of electoral laws. But the main concentration had to be on Queensland because there was an election around. Indeed, a standing committee of this Parliament took evidence in Queensland on this matter. I recall that in public evidence taken in Queensland a question was asked of the General Secretary of the Australian Labor Party about the results of the election before last. The question was: `If there had been the fairest boundaries on earth, one vote one value and no gerrymander, who would have won the last election?'. The General Secretary of the Labor Party replied: `The National Party would have done so'. That rather spoilt the track record of that trail. When one looks at that situation--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much. They are just confirming it. It would have won, of course, because it was a preferential system of voting. Therefore, as in the last election, in respect of which an attempt is being made to suggest that on a 40 per cent vote the National Party won on a minority vote, the truth is that the very thing that Senator Macklin and Senator Robert Ray have just said happened; that is, under a preferential system, by the distribution of preferences, a government was formed on a majority preferred vote. It was not revealed that the zones in Queensland which Labor is criticising were invented by the Labor Party. The boundaries in Western Australia which Labor is criticising were also invented by the Labor Party. The Labor Party deliberately sets up simplistic issues and chases them. This issue surely involves the major hypocrisy of all time-an attempt to get the Australian Bill of Rights Bill through at any cost. The Bill would have delimited or destroyed freedoms, not enlarged them. A bargain was made. The Government promised the Democrats that it would set up an inquiry by the Human Rights Commission. That bargain was to deliver the Democrat vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting that the Minister keeps suggesting that the Opposition stopped the progress of the Bill of Rights Bill through the Parliament. That is palpably untrue. It would have been quite possible for the Government to have gone ahead with the Bill of Rights Bill in the form it was in and, with the Democrat vote, to have forced it through. What stopped the progress of the Bill through the Parliament was the public. The outrage of every section of the public stopped the Bill. Let us not have the Minister talking this nonsense. If he believes that it is the Opposition which has stopped the progress of the Bill of Rights Bill, let him bring it back before the Parliament. He knows that the Demo-crats have promised to support it. He knows that the Government has the numbers. The fact is that the Government is withdrawing the Bill because of the public outrage and the petitions that were constantly put before the Parliament. Virtually every section of the population has said that it is outraged by such a Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that there has been an attempt to hide the situation by the use of the gag. Great hypocrisy has been shown by the Government and the Democrats. Hypocrisy has been shown by the Prime Minister in writing a letter which he and his Government knew was based on absolute falsity. It was a quick trick to get a lousy little vote-although it is getting a lousy littler vote as time goes on and the lemmings flee. `Even fleas have little fleas upon their backs which bite them; those small fleas have smaller fleas and so on, ad infinitum.' We all know the little rhyme. The lousy littler votes move across the chamber. This wonderful little conspiracy, like all the little conspiracies of the Democrats, failed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are, and always have been in this chamber, the limpet fish of the Labor Party. They swim alongside the big fish, feeding off them and making little arrangements for a modus vivendi with the Labor Party. The limpet fish are now springing to the help of their mentor, of their food box, by supporting a gag. I cannot think of more disgraceful behaviour on the part of both the Democrats and the Government. The fact that we had to force the Minister to make an admission that evidence given to the Senate by the Human Rights Commission during an Estimates committee hearing was true is an outrage. The Minister, a lawyer, is here to tell us the facts. The facts ought to have been before the Parliament when the Bill of Rights Bill was originally before it. We ought to have been told that the next clause we were to deal with in debate would not have been enforceable in the way the Government was projecting it because learned lawyers, learned textbooks and the Human Rights Commission had put it in writing.

I remind the Democrats that if they are to have a shred of credibility they must put aside their part in this conspiracy to bring down a gag and stop making arrangements behind the Chair. The Prime Minister is expert at that in regard to the Australian Council of Trade Unions and others. He is very good at deserting his Treasurer. I hope to goodness that he deserts the Treasurer today because if anyone deserves to be deserted the Treasurer does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I rose to make two points. Everybody now knows why the gag was moved. The Democrats have been exposed as abject humbugs. Everybody now knows that when the Prime Minister wrote that letter he did not believe in what he was doing. He was making a simplistic arrangement to get a vote to force the Bill of Rights Bill through. Everybody now knows that it was not the Opposition, even with the solid logic of its arguments, that defeated the Bill of Rights Bill. It is true that the Opposition, by giving leadership in the community, defeated the Bill; but the Bill could have been carried here. However, it is being dragged back from the Senate by the Minister, as he has had to do with other legislation in the past, because he knows that the quality of the Bill was rejected totally by the public. I believe that this is one of the most disgraceful performances I have seen in the Senate. </PARA>

It is a bit harsh to say that members of the Australian Labor Party would like to hide that discussion. It should be highlighted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two factors are involved. The first is the body that does the inquiry into the Queensland, Western Australian, or whatever, case. The second is the head of power. It may be quite competent for the Human Rights Commission to inquire into the matter, but whether ultimately it is the correct head of power for us as a government, or for whatever government is in power, to use is a matter of doubt. Had we got the referendum proposal on advisory opinions up and running, without honourable senators opposite opposing it, we could have gone to the High Court of Australia and stopped all this argument by getting an advisory opinion on the matter. But the honourable senator cannot expect us to anticipate a ruling of the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator may well be right in arguing from the Covenant that there is no power. Until I examine that question in detail I tend to come down on his side and believe that there may not be. But I think that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is entitled to go to the High Court to find out whether the legislation is valid and leave it to the High Court to decide. I point out that if the High Court had had powers of advisory opinion we could have found out these things a lot more profitably in terms of the time spent here and the argument in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted to make those points. We should not try to suppress debate on this issue but there are many opportunities in this chamber other than this debate. There are many opportunities other than this debate to debate whether the external affairs power will in fact apply in this case. The only thing for which I commend Senator Sir John Carrick is for having raised this matter and gained the very generous support of the Australian Democrats, the Australian Labor Party and everyone else to have an open inquiry with witnesses from all around Australia to examine this matter. The Senate will, I hope, be given the benefit of our opinion by May or June of next year. </PARA>

Various referenda were held over the years to undermine and to sack the Senate. I know, for example, that socialist governments want to get rid of the State governments and have regional divisions with the strings all tied to Canberra.

Queensland had a Labor Government for nearly 40 years. As is the wont of Labor governments, that Government abolished the upper House in Queensland. Queensland is a huge State with huge areas of sparsely populated development. The system of electoral weightage is accepted all around the world.

This Bill forms part of a pattern of attack on State governments in Australia by the socialist Federal Government. Socialist government have been doing this over many years. I was pointing to the fact that electoral weightage-it is the zonal system which the Government complains about-merely reflects the same principles applied in the Australian Constitution. The Senate itself exists so that people in the lesser populated States will not be disadvantaged by the more populous States. Tasmania is the complete reversal of what is recommended in the Constitution. It has 12 senators and only five Federal seats. Do the Australian Democrats scream that that is a miscarriage of justice and a rape of human rights? We do not hear them. In fact the Democrats in the Senate-the political tumbleweeds who blow around with every bit of breeze that they hope will be to their advantage-are exploiting an electoral loophole in the Constitution. They are not screaming about a rape of democracy over that. They represent less than 8 per cent of the people, yet they have the balance of power in the Senate. They do not have one seat in the House of Representatives, yet they are given political party status. A party is supposed to have 10 seats in the House of Representatives before it can be declared a political party. The Democrats have none. Successive governments, trying to buy their votes, do not call that a rape of democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, I have no wish to prolong this aspect of the debate but I think it is necessary to set the record straight in respect of the letter from the Human Rights Commission to the Proportional Representation Society of Australia which has been called in aid by Senator Durack and Senator Sir John Carrick, especially this morning. I repeat that it is not the case that the Human Rights Commission has formulated any concluded view on the particular matter that we have been talking about, that is, the proper meaning of the expression `universal and equal suffrage' in Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and whether that means that State voting systems have to be equally weighted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reply to the Proportional Representation Society was in answer to a complaint that the International Covenant required the use of a proportional representation voting system in the Federal Parliament. The extracts from the travaux preparatoires referred to by Mr Thomson reflected a decision or position of the Commission. That is true. The extracts from those preparatory materials dealt with the question of voting systems, not the question, which is logically distinct, about the weight of votes and the way in which boundaries are drawn. I give one illustration of what I mean. Mr Thomson's letter did not address or refer to the very important annotation in the Secretary-General's notes to Article 25 which suggests that the Article requires, in its proper interpretation, some equality of weight in votes. I refer to the quote from 20 February when we were debating the Bill of Rights. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The provision, it was thought, would leave States parties to the Covenant free to regulate their own electoral systems, provided each vote carried equal weight. </PARA>
<PARA>That is something that obviously has to be taken into account in any future exercise in exploring what this vexed and difficult provision means. Again, I have to say for the record that it is the case that statements by one or a few nations in the preparatory materials are certainly helpful in interpreting Article 25 but they are equally clearly not decisive. The United Kingdom's comments have been referred to but, as I understand it, they were made in the context of that country's desire to maintain a first past the post, rather than a preferential, voting system and as such they were directed to the requirements of the voting system rather than the particular question of voting equality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is another relevant consideration that the United Kingdom may have wanted to preserve. I simply make the point that one needs a thorough examination of these sorts of materials to determine not only what nations happened to say at the time but also what their own systems were at the time of making those comments and when and if they were changed after the drafting of the Covenant. This clearly requires much more research than that which the Commission did in responding to the Proportional Representation Society's complaint on a different issue. It requires much more research than could have been done in response to that complaint.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am saying no more than that the argument has not been foreclosed in anything the Commission, through its Secretary, may have communicated. To that extent it is not really fair to say that the Prime Minister was in any way misleading when he responded as he did to the Australian Democrats. None of that is to deny that there are many difficulties in interpreting these provisions. There are many uncertainties as to whether equality of voting systems is required. I do not want yet again to get into that argument today. I suggest that the Government is displaying a great deal of patience, given the desperate timetabling problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all very well for Senator Gareth Evans to try to lead us off this question. I have little comment following the apt description by Senator Durack and Senator Sir John Carrick of the gagging by the Australian Democrats supporting the Australian Labor Party, of a Bill on human rights. I do not think there is any need for me to say anything further about the hypocrisy which that action entailed following their publicly announced decision-part of their policy-that they would never apply the gag. As I say, two honourable senators have already dealt with that situation far better than I can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Gareth Evans says that the letter of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the Australian Democrats promising a deal-if they voted for the legislation he would make sure that the Human Rights Commission takes on the electoral laws in Queensland-was not misleading the Parliament. Is the Minister saying that the Commission had not had any legal opinion at all advising it that it did not have any power at all to follow that course through Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights? Is the Minister suggesting for one minute that the Government had not sought any legal opinion? Is the Minister suggesting that the Human Rights Commission knew that it had no power under Article 25? He keeps telling us that it has never reached a view on that. Is the Minister saying for one minute that he did not know that the Commission was quite well aware that it had no power because legal opinion had been given to it? If that is what the Minister is saying, I would be most surprised. I believe that the Commission was well aware it knew that it had absolutely no power under Article 25 to enter into any inspection of the electoral laws in Queensland. I believe that the Prime Minister, before he wrote his letter, was also well aware that no legal power was available to him. I would like the Minister to answer those questions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was speaking earlier I mentioned a textbook entitled `The International Bill of Rights' and referred to a discussion on page 242. In fact the relevant part is contained on page 240 and the discussion goes from page 238 to page 241. Some useful footnotes should also be referred to. I point out to Senator Evans that I sought in no way to mislead the Committee. I told the Committee that I was referring to a view expressed by the Human Rights Commission in relation to a complaint from the Proportional Representation Society. Of course, it was not dealing with a specific opinion of whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires a system of one vote one value as against one person one vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The meaning of the phrase `equal suffrage' applies equally by analogical argument familiar to lawyers to the argument on the issue of one vote one value. It is equally strong against that interpretation. It is a normal piece of legal reasoning to quote the reasoning on one issue where it is clearly logical and reasonable that it should be applied to another issue. I turn to the textbook and the notes and to the careful material prepared in that letter from the Secretary to the Human Rights Commission. One can see the high relevance of that reasoning to the solution to the question of whether the Covenant requires one vote one value. All reasoning we have indicates that it does not. That is the basis of the argument that the Opposition has been advancing. I wanted to make that point quite clear to Senator Gareth Evans. </PARA>

It seems to me that the very purpose of the national capital is for organisations such as the Commission to be based here. I really cannot think of any sensible explanation as to why it should be shifted. The argument for having a national capital and for having the organisations of the Federal Government based here primarily makes great sense. It has been advanced frequently. The head offices of all sorts of departments and other organisations have been moved to the national capital. Now we are suddenly faced with this quite unconvincing move of the Human Rights Commission to Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What will be located in Canberra in place of the Commission? Will there be an office in Canberra? If so, to what extent will it be staffed? I point out that in the years 1984-85 and 1985-86 the Canberra office handled 1,233 complaints. By comparison, during the same period the Brisbane office and the New South Wales delegates reported respective case loads of 520 and 1,135. Of the complaints handled in Canberra, 10 per cent were from the Northern Territory and Tasmania and 33 per cent were from Australian Capital Territory residents. The remaining 57 per cent and many of the other complaints related directly to national policy. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me important that the Commission should be retained in Canberra because the overwhelming majority of the respondents and the departments involved are in fact based here. I think we are entitled to be told exactly what the cost of this absurd move will really be to taxpayers. I cannot imagine that the Commission can function without an office in Canberra. At the same time it will have to build an additional structure in Sydney. Things will be moved up and down from Canberra. I think it will cost, if the move is done properly, twice as much as at present. I do not think there is any simple way that the move can be explained especially when it is considered that it is a national organisation that should be based here. But what about the Australian Capital Territory employees. I know they have been told they can move to Sydney and they will get other jobs. But the employees of the office here seem to have had scant regard paid to the fact that they are human beings. They thought that they had prospects for a career structure here. They are virtually being told that they are being thrown out of the place. </PARA>

It is proposed to maintain an office of the Human Rights Commission in Canberra. It remains to be seen whether it will be in precisely the same location. Clearly, it will have a staff which is appropriate to the size of the Canberra exercise, rather than the national one. I am not privy to all of the Attorney-General's thinking as to reasons or motivations. All I can do is to repeat what he said, that is, it is desired to move the Commission to a major population centre-where there is more human rights action, if one likes, than is the case in the collectivist paradise in the Australian Capital Territory-and a location where it will be more accessible and visible, perhaps, to the community at large. Beyond that, I have no further information. But it is certainly not anticipated to ride rough-shod over the rights or career prospects of any current employees.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is clear also that the respondents are mainly the departments in Canberra. That is clearly the case. It is absurd to say that the cost of indulging in the luxury of moving the Commission to Sydney is only $1.3m. That is undoubtedly the removal cost. No one would suggest it is likely to be done for a more reasonable figure than that. I am talking about the ongoing cost of constantly shifting information between Canberra and Sydney. There will be information in Canberra that is needed in Sydney. It is a recurrent cost which will occur for as long as the office remains in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What other organisations is this Government planning to take away from the national capital? Which other public servants will be moved out? Has it given any thought to the implications for this city of a decrease in the population? If it continues to take public servants out, and move the national organisations away from Canberra, it will reduce the population and the impact on the private sector and everybody else will be quite severe. We are faced with the rundown in the construction of the new Parliament House over the next couple of years. It is likely that many of the people who are now working there will not be able to obtain employment in the national capital when that job is completed, even if every other project that one could think of went ahead. If as few as 400 of those families move away, the impact will be very severe. One cannot suddenly have on the market in Canberra 400 houses either for sale or rent. At the same time the Government is talking about moving the Human Rights Commission. It may involve only a few people. But I would like to know what else the Government is planning to move, because this city cannot stand this sort of up and down activity. </PARA>

I therefore ask: Will the Minister also-since he invited us to look at the travaux preparatoires, the working discussions and papers of the Covenant-have his officers seek out the relevant papers and the discussions, that is, the discussions relating to voting systems and voting methods, and give the chamber a document which will give us the basic information?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to raise some matters about appointments to the Commission. If I may, I shall raise them in relation to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill as well. Under the amendments that have been passed to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Bill the Commission will comprise a part-time Pre-sident; a Human Rights Commissioner, who is required to be legally qualified; a Race Discri-mination Commissioner; and a Sex Discrimination Commissioner. I take it that, as the Human Rights Commissioner now has to be legally qualified, the President does not have to be legally qualified. I would like confirmation that that is the situation. In those circumstances, I am interested to know what type of person the Government has in mind to appoint as President. Does the Government have some predisposition towards a judge or a retired judge or does it have somebody else in mind from outside the legal sphere altogether?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noted an article in the Australian newspaper on 3 November which stated that the Government intends to appoint a prominent Sydney barrister, Mr Marcus Einfeld, QC, as President of the Human Rights Commission. I should like to know whether that is the case, whether the Government has already approached Mr Einfeld and he has accepted and will be recommended for appointment. If that is not the case, perhaps Senator Gareth Evans, in the absence of a decision having been made, will tell us the type of person the Government is looking for. I am somewhat mystified by the decision of the Government that the Human Rights Commissioner has to be legally qualified. That is defined to mean a person who is or has been a judge of a court of a State or the Commonwealth or who is a barrister or solicitor. I do not imagine the Government will appoint a judge or even a retired judge as a Human Rights Commissioner sitting under a President. In that case, I wonder, firstly, why the Human Rights Commissioner has to be a lawyer. Secondly, has the Government decided to appoint a particular person to that position? Again I refer to the article in the Australian of 3 November which indicated that Mr Brian Burdekin, now Principal Private Secretary to the Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, is to be appointed as Human Rights Commissioner. That would certainly be a nice promotion for Mr Burdekin, particularly with the salary involved. I am mystified as to what qualifications Mr Burdekin could have for such a prestigious job as Human Rights Commissioner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Senator Durack's understanding of the formal situation as to required qualifications is correct. There is no requirement that the Chairman be a lawyer or of legal background, whereas by contrast there is such a requirement for the full time Human Rights Commissioner position so described. Essentially, the reason for the Human Rights Commissioner position having that set of qualifications attached to it is two-fold, as I understand it: Primarily, because as a full time functioning Commissioner that person will be exercising the determining power from time to time as well as the investigative conciliatory power and it is felt that because of the quasi-judicial character, if you like, of that particular jurisdiction it is appropriate--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When a complaint is made under one or other of these categories-race discrimination, sex discrimination or pursuant to the Covenant. I am sorry, it is only under the sex Act at the moment but it will be under the race Act when we get to the next Bill and the provisions are brought into parallel. There is that determining power. We are discussing the difference between the power to make determinations, which are subsequently enforceable through the Federal courts, as compared with the power merely to report. We were talking previously about the jurisdiction of the employment discrimination committee. There is this more formalised power that it has been thought desirable should be exercised by someone with legal qualifications training. I suppose the other side to it is that the Human Rights Commissioner is being given a particular identified functional responsibility with respect to the various covenants, as distinct from the sex and race Acts, including such things, I guess, as the one we have been debating all morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since questions of legal interpretation will arise in the application of those covenants to particular situations it was thought again desirable that such a person have a legal background. The Chairman, by contrast, is the sort of figurehead and capstone of the organisation. We need him to have promotional and administrative oversight skills, I suppose, rather than necessarily legal ones, although it is probable that in practice the most likely candidates for this job would be people with a legal background-a current or former judge or someone with such qualifications.

I repeat that no decision has been taken. By contrast, the statutory position of Sex Discrimination Commissioner remains unchanged and as a result it is reasonable to assume that, unless for personal reasons that Commissioner should want to resign, there will be continuity in that particular office because it is a position created under the Sex Discrimination Act which is not being changed in any relevant respect by this legislation today.</PARA></TALK.START>

I stated earlier that the book authored by Ralph Pettman points out that the Human Rights Commission will pay teachers up to $1,000 so long as they `contract to take part' and report in detail on the ideas, activities and resources which prove most creative in practice. According to Senator Evans, Ralph Pettman must be a good author because he has been awarded an honourable mention by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation and given a prize for the teaching of human rights. I have already pointed out that in this wonderful book Ralph Pettman said that our little five-year-old girls and boys go to school with rather set stereotypes and that in the first four weeks there is a lot of work to be done on them. According to the Human Rights Commission, it is of paramount importance that in the first four weeks we do a lot of work to get rid of those stereotypes that have been created in Australian families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How does one get rid of those stereotypes? There are good ways to do it and there are suggestions to the teachers on how to go about setting up their classrooms. The suggestion made to teachers is that no one should be allowed to play with cars in the play corner unless there are equal numbers of boys and girls and that no one should be allowed to play with paper dolls unless the little girls can persuade one of the boys to play with them, because if the little girls wanted to play with dolls that would only encourage the sex stereotypes that are so disastrous. This is the sort of rubbish which is being put out by the Human Rights Commission and which it is paying the teachers-directly into the teachers' pockets and not to the schools-to teach our little children. In the first four weeks of their school lives there is a lot of work to be done to get rid of their fantasies that the homes they come from-where Mum has probably stayed home to look after them-are ideal situations. A lot of work has to be done to get that out of their little minds, and that indoctrination has to take place in those first four weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told by the Minister that the work of the Commission is highly regarded internationally and that that particular author is very good. I ask the Minister a question. I got this book quite some time ago and I have not been able to get another copy since. It was in a kit of two books and a video. I have asked repeatedly for another copy of that book and I have been refused that copy. I have been told that it is not available. The Parliamentary Library does not even have a kit and, every time I ask for copies, one is brought from the National Library. I want to know why it is unavailable to senators, why the Minister supports this rubbish, and whether he will please amend this legislation so that we can throw out this indoctrination and the bribery that accompanies it and get back to a situation where the Australian people will have a say as to how their children are brought up. </PARA>

The money is to cover the expenses of trialling the program. It is not regarded as remuneration. The program has been accepted by schools authorities including, I might draw to Senator Walters's attention, Catholic education offices. If it is the case that teachers have a little left over after they have incurred the expenses that are associated with this, might I just suggest in a spirit of Christian charity that it is small recompense for the additional work and report writing as to the effectiveness of the program which the people on the receiving end of these grants are required to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

I gather, because it is kindergarten and first grade, that it is done within school hours. I gather that it is, therefore, done within the school curriculum. I ask the Minister: What $1,000 or $500 costs to individual teachers could possibly be associated with the trialling of this sort of thing within the classrooms of our little five- and six-year-olds? If there is any cost, would teachers be able to get it off their tax; would it be a tax deduction?

I did bring it up earlier and they should be aware. On the subject of giving advice to teachers, the book says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Children come to school with some fairly set ideas. A lot of these are sex-role stereo-types. A lot of work has to be done with non-sexist education with the class to begin the Human Rights Integrated Approach. This should be done in the first four weeks of the school year. The particular grade in mind for the units of work in this approach is first grade but most of the ideas could be used with kindergarten . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So let us not quibble about the assertion that it is not for the young. It is for the five- and six-year-olds in kindergarten. The Minister should not try to tell me that this rubbish is not being used on the little girls and boys in their first four weeks of school life. The bureaucrats giving him advice should not tell him that it is not for the young. The book says very specifically that this approach should be directed at children in kindergarten and first year and should apply to the first four weeks of their school life. So let us not quibble or try to get away with the idiotic situation that the Minister will make some inquiries and let me know. He does not have to let me know. It is all there in black and white in the book that I have just been reading to him-the book put out by the Human Rights Commission which teachers are being paid to use. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to follow up in slightly broader terms a couple of points that were made by Senator Walters. I would like to ask the Minister what steps are being taken by the Government to ensure that the biases that we have seen over the last few years in the operation of the Human Rights Commission, particularly in the area of education but going wider than that, will not continue under the new Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I take the area of edu-cation as an example. The existing Commission has in many of its publications intimated its intention to use the education system to indoctrinate Australian children with its values and ideologies. It has made no pretence at hiding this intention; it has been quite explicit. For ex-ample, at page 73 of Occasional Paper No. 9 en-titled `Teaching, Enacting and Sticking Up for Human Rights', the Commission states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Joining in the Commission's political project through its reconstructionist educational work, will be appealing to many teachers; they will welcome the opportunity to engage in conscientisation with their students in the interests of social justice. Others will find such work as far too `political' for their liking; they will regard the curriculum too `radical' and far removed from what they regard as `education' to feel comfortable with. </PARA>
<PARA>That same document states quite proudly:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . its `program makes no pretence at all at being value free'. It has `explicit ideological commitments'. </PARA>
<PARA> Just what those commitments are, what the Commission is directing teachers to do with their students is `to reflect upon the social, political, and economic contradictions in the culture and to take systematic political action against oppressive power blocs'. </PARA>
<PARA>The sorts of values that are expressed there were reiterated in the 1985 publication entitled `Teaching of Human Rights' which, admittedly, now has been pulled out for review. This publication is directed at school children and contains such gems as:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been mass assassination, too, by more covert and direct means. </PARA>
<PARA>The reference there, of course, is to Western democracies. In human rightspeak the publication basically is talking about the capitalist world economy. The publication goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The construction of a capitalist world economy, predicated upon dishonesty and greed, has slaughtered uncounted millions the world over through exploitation and the mis-development of global resources. The US and the other while `free market' democracies have much to answer for in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA>As I think Senator Walters said, teachers were being bribed to use the text with enticements of payment of up to $500 or, in some instances, $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is undeniable the attitudes that are reflected in the documents that I have quoted which come from the Commission are quite contrary and alien to many of the values that would be held by the overwhelming majority of the Australian people. They are essentially Marxist-Leninist views. They are not views that are subscribed to by the Australian people. Over recent years the Human Rights Commission has engaged in action which has led the Australian public to have very grave concern about the direction in which the Commission has been going during its existence. There seems to be no guarantee at all-indeed, perhaps the contrary will be the case-that this will not continue as a result of the new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give a few examples of some of the other things that have happened over recent times which I think show that the Commission has promoted values and ideologies that are out of kilter with those of most Australians. We had the suppression in 1984 of a major report on affirmative action which the Commission itself commissioned. The Gabriel Moens report was suppressed because it came out with views that were contrary to those of the Commission. We had the banning last year of the then shadow Attorney-General, Neil Brown, from all the offices of the Commission without any cause being shown for such an intolerant and arbitrary action. We had the support by the Commission of the right of the feminist group Women Against Rape to disrupt solemn Anzac Day observances by protest marchers. Again, that action was sanctioned by the Human Rights Commission. The Pettman publications-and I was very interested to hear Senator Evans so adulatory of Mr Pettman-indicate that the Commission regards homosexual relations as an alternative lifestyle worthy of the same recognition and protection as traditional marriage and supports the right of homosexuals to bring foreign homosexual lovers into Australia as immigrants. Again, these are values which I do not believe are shared by most Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to hear from the Minister just which direction he thinks the new Commission will take in the years ahead. What action is the Government going to take, if any, to influence the values and attitudes of the new Commission? If it is not proposing to take any action in that sense, how is it going to ensure that the Commission does take account of the values of most Australians?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I can say really is that bias is in the eye of the beholder, by and large. The Commission's basic stance has been one of non-value neutrality, as it has said quite starkly in some of those publications to which Senator Short refers. The Commission is not value neutral about human dignity, it is not value neutral about human equality and it is not value neutral about all those rights which have won the respect of civilised countries through the international covenants and the machinery which the Commission is endeavouring to enforce. It is perhaps the case that in some aspects of some of the Commission's publications points have been made, often for illustrative purposes or comparative purposes or debate stimulation purposes, that perhaps have been expressed in a way that in retrospect was not the wisest or most careful way, and I think that would be acknowledged within the Commission and maybe even by our fabled author himself, in retrospect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our honourably mentioned Mr Pettman. We could no doubt have this argument for a long time. We have had it in the past but really time is making it a bit difficult to stretch it out again today. All I can say for the future is that the Commission is obviously conscious of some of the reaction that some of its publications have drawn. By and large it has been only a few pages of a few publications which have generated this concern, and so far as I am aware the great bulk of the Commission's publications, of which there have been many, have been very well received throughout the educational system and elsewhere. I think it is quite impossible to ascribe any kind of systematic bias to the Commission, other than the one I have described, of the commitment to those values and their promulgation which, of course, may be offensive to some sections of the community, but so be it, because that is what it is established to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So far as the future is concerned, it will depend obviously very much on the calibre, credibility and integrity of the people who are appointed to the key positions and of those who staff the research, writing and information generating positions. I am sure that decisions will be made in that respect that will create a body that deserves the commendation and enthusiastic support not only of this side of politics but of members of the Liberal Party as well, because I keep being told that they support the values that are enshrined, but they just do not like the machinery or the way that some of it is working out. If they do support those values, I suggest it would be helpful if they got behind, not in a carping and destructive way but in a positive way, the work of the Commission and gave it encouragement where they thought encouragement was due. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that the criticisms that have been put forward by this side of politics about the Commission are in any way carping criticisms. They are criticisms or comments that go to the heart of where this country is going in terms of its value systems and the whole mechanism of promoting the ensuring of human rights. We have a system in this country, and we have had it for generations, basically through the common law, but also through the traditions that have been built up over two centuries, which have given us probably the most value free and secure human rights of virtually any country. We now have a situation which, with the existence in particular of the Human Rights Commission, has developed over recent years, and which is causing serious concerns, I think, to quite a few sections of the Australian community. We now have an institution which is going to be given more powers than the Commission to date has had. It will be able to continue to perpetuate its role in value setting in Australian society. Far from being a carping comment, I think it is a quite fundamental comment to make that there surely has to be some assurance that the bias that has come into the operation of the Human Rights Commission over recent years is not going to be perpetuated. If we want good will to be generated towards the new Commission, the last thing that the Government should do is to set up a Commission when the Government can give no assurance to those who are very concerned that the Commission is not going to lead us down a path that is contrary to the views of most Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no question at all that either I or any other senator on this side of the chamber would say for one moment that there is not a need for equal human rights and equal opportunity to be taught in the schools. The teachers normally do that. They normally teach equality of race, colour, religion, creed and gender. What we are talking about is the way the Human Rights Commission has entered this teaching area and has paid teachers to do a job that they normally do, but it is paying them to do it in a far more radical manner. It is paying the teachers to get stuck into and to brainwash the little children as soon as they reach school age, in the first four weeks of their going to kindergarten. That is what we are objecting to. The normal teachers out there in the community, who handle this subject very well, would not have a bar of what the Commission is asking them to do. Because of that, not so long ago the Human Rights Commission had to advertise in the newspapers saying that if teachers took that up, it would pay them. I would be interested to know how many applications the Commission has received. I would like the Minister to get that information for me. How many teachers responded and took up the suggestion?

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENTS (1) AND (2)</PARA>
<PARA> These amendments insert into the Racial Discrimination Act definitions of the terms `Federal Court' and `registered organisation'. These terms are used in the new procedural provisions which are proposed to be inserted into the Racial Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENT (3)</PARA>
<PARA> This amendment inserts four new clauses into the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>NEW CLAUSES 14 TO 16</PARA>
<PARA> The first three of these new clauses are designed to preserve, as far as practicable, the effect of sub-section 24 (2) of the Racial Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA> As mentioned, the major thrust of the amendments to be moved today to this Bill is to replace the procedural provisions in the Racial Discrimination Act with provisions modelled on the procedural provisions in the Sex Discrimination Act. It is not intended to make any alteration to the substantive prohibitions on discrimination which appear in the Racial Discrimination Act. Sub-section 24 (2) of the Racial Discrimination Act creates exceptions to two of the substantive prohibitions in the Act. Because sub-section 24 (2) appears within the text of the procedural provisions and since those procedural provisions are to be deleted and replaced, it is necessary to relocate the exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of the exceptions, presently embodied in paragraph 24 (2) (a), provides that a civil proceeding under the Act may not be instituted in respect of an act in relation to accommodation in a dwelling where that accommodation is shared with the person who did the act or a person on whose behalf the act was done or with a relative of either of those persons. That exception is to be preserved through the insertion of a new sub-section (3) at the end of section 12 in the Racial Discrimination Act. The second exception, presently embodied in paragraph 24 (2) (b) of the Act, creates a similar exception in relation to employment. That exception is to be preserved through the new sub-section 15 (5). </PARA>
<PARA> It is to be noted that sub-section 24 (2), while excepting the doing of certain acts in relation to private dwellings, does not permit a person to advertise an intention to do such an act. This result is to be preserved through the proposed amendment of section 16 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The rationale for this distinction between actions and advertisements is that, while one would not wish to regulate actions that take place in the context of private dwellings, one certainly wants to prevent public advertisements of racist approaches to employment and accommodation. It is one thing to say that what you do in relation to your private dwelling is your own business, but it is quite another thing to allow advertisements which provide that, for example, `No Aboriginals need apply.' Such advertisements are unlawful now, and they should continue to be unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA> The new clause 17 in the Bill inserts a new Part III into the Racial Discrimination Act. The purpose of this change is to replace the present complaint handling procedures in the Racial Discrimination Act with provisions modelled on the complaint handling procedures in the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions have been debated at length, and passed by the Senate in 1983 during the consideration of the then Sex Discrimination Bill, so I do not propose to go into them in any detail. Briefly, they are as follows. </PARA>
<PARA> New sections 21 to 23 provide for the receipt of complaints and their transmission to the Commissioner. New sections 24 to 24e provide for the Commissioner to inquire into complaints. Where necessary, the Commission may seek an interim determination to preserve the status quo between the parties during the inquiry process. This may be necessary where, for example, a complainant in an employment discrimination case is threatened with dismissal. The Commissioner has the power to obtain relevant information and documents and to convene a conference of the parties. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Commissioner is unable to resolve the matter by conciliation, there is provision for the matter to be referred to the Commission. Sections 24f and 25z deal with the powers of the Commission to inquire into matters and, if necessary, make determinations in relation to them. A determination, which cannot for constitutional reasons be binding and conclusive upon the parties, may include the finding that the respondent should compensate the complainant in various ways. If necessary, the Commission or the complainant may institute a proceeding in the Federal Court to enforce a determination (section 25za). </PARA>
<PARA> The replacement of the procedural provisions in the Racial Discrimination Act is necessary because the present provisions have not proved effective. Presently, the Act provides for the Commissioner for Community Relations to inquire into complaints and to attempt to settle them. If complaints cannot be settled, a certificate may be issued which entitles the complainant to institute proceedings in a court. In practice, the institution of legal proceedings in a court, without any prior statement as to their rights under the Racial Discrimination Act, has proved to be beyond the financial and emotional resources of most complainants. In fact, the 11 years of the Act's operation have seen the issue of only 33 certificates, and the commencement of only one court action. The Commissioner for Community Relations, Mr Jeremy Long, appointed by the Coalition Government in 1981, has recently observed that no complainant under the Racial Discrimination Act has ever succeeded in obtaining a remedy before the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Another compelling reason for the changes to the procedural provisions which are proposed is the administrative efficiencies which can be gained through the procedures being identical in the two major Acts for which the Commission has responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENT (4)</PARA>
<PARA> This amendment removes the offence of insulting an officer. It also alters a number of cross-references in the section in line with the new procedural provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of the offence of insulting an officer is consistent with the amendments made by the Opposition, and supported by the Democrats, to the substantive offence provisions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENT (5)</PARA>
<PARA> The essential purpose of the Racial Discrimination Act is to provide an effective remedy for those who are discriminated against on the grounds of their race. The new procedural provisions are designed to provide the basis for that effective remedy. This amendment inserts offence provisions which are designed to complement the new procedural provisions. Taken together, they ensure that those who seek to obstruct or disrupt the work of the Commissioner or the Commission can be effectively prevented from doing so. Each of the provisions is closely modelled on an equivalent provision in the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENT (6)</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this amendment is that the maximum term for which the Race Discrimination Commissioner can be appointed is to be extended from 5 years to 7. The longer maximum period of appointment provides a greater opportunity for the Government to obtain the services of a first class Commissioner who might reasonably expect a reasonable term. Such additional flexibility in the appointment of Commissioners does not, of course, deprive the Government of the opportunity to appoint a Commissioner for a shorter term. </PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENT (7)</PARA>
<PARA> This amendment removes the current legal aid provision from the Racial Discrimination Act. That provision is to be replaced by two provisions which are embodied in the new procedural provisions. These provisions are clauses 25zb and 25zc. </PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENT (8)</PARA>
<PARA> This amendment recasts clause 42 of the Bill to permit the Commission to be constituted by a single member for the purpose of making a determination under the Sex Discrimination Act. The practice of the Human Rights Commission under the Act indicates that three-member panels are often not necessary for less complex matters. The amended provision will enable the President to constitute a determination panel with a single legally qualified member, while at the same time permitting the President to appoint two or more members to a panel in cases that raise major issues or are particularly complex. </PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENT (9)</PARA>
<PARA> This amendment will mean that future appointments to the Office of Sex Discrimination Commissioner may be for a maximum period of 7 years. It is being made for the same reasons of increased flexibility that were behind the increase in the maximum term of appointment for the Race Discrimination Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENTS (10) AND (11)</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 31 of the Bill makes the amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act which are set out in the Schedule to the Bill. The amendments are designed to remove instances of sexist language from the Racial Discrimination Act. The replacement of the procedural provisions in the Act has made some of those changes unnecessary and amendments (10) and (11) remove the relevant entries from the Schedule. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had a lengthy debate on these two Bills, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Bill and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (Transitional Provisions and Consequential (Amendments) Bill, on two occasions. They were first introduced into this chamber towards the end of last year, nearly 12 months ago, and were debated as part of a Bill of Rights package earlier this year. The Opposition strongly resists the allegations that have been made about filibusters. The Government has well and truly been caught out about the allegations it made about a record time, which has now been proven to be quite false and not supported by any of the statistics of the Senate. Nevertheless, there was a very substantial debate then and we have had another very substantial debate this week on the two Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has been most concerned to ensure the fullest debate on this matter. We opposed the second reading of these two Bills when they were put to the Senate earlier this year. We remain implacably opposed to them and, of course, we are opposed to the third reading. We will divide and vote on the third reading. We will do so because we want to emphasise, in the clearest and firmest way available to us as Opposition senators, that we believe that the Government is embarking upon a completely wrong course for the future in re-establishing and souping up, so to speak, the existing Human Rights Commission. The Human Rights Commission was set up by the Fraser Government as an experiment in this field and with the view to giving effect to the obligations we incurred when we ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We put a sunset clause into the legislation, which indicates that we looked at the Commission as an experiment. We believe that it is an experiment that has failed and failed dismally. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we are not obliged under the International Covenant to have a body such as the Human Rights Commission. Under the terms of the Covenant, Australia, or any other signatory or party to that Covenant, is obliged to take effective action to give meaning to its obligations. As we have always known, and as we knew when we ratified the Covenant, overwhelmingly the laws of Australia, both Federal and State, do observe the rules and obligations of the Covenant. Indeed, the rating of Australia in the world for its observance of human rights is right up in the 90-plus percentage. That is really at the top of world ratings. I suppose we are part of the vast minority of countries in the world which observe those basic standards of human rights. Under our legal and political systems, which we inherited from the United Kingdom, they have evolved. We enjoy them under our present legal and political system, and have done in the past, and we will continue to enjoy them if we observe the time-honoured methods of enforcing those standards in our community. They will be enforced only if we have a free society-one in which there is a free and active democratic system, as we undoubtedly have in this country, and an independent and fearless judiciary. Those are the ways in which we can continue to maintain our system and the ways in which we can continue to observe the obligations that we have assumed under this Covenant. </PARA>
<PARA> As we have said, there is clearly a role for conciliation as a method of enforcing a number of these human rights values, such as rules of anti-sex discrimination or anti-racial discrimination. We have legislation on those matters and there are obligations against discrimination in a number of areas. We believe that this legislation has gone far too far by giving the Minister the power to declare categories of discrimination in the future, albeit that, as a result of amendments to this legislation, that will be subject to disallowance by the Parliament. But, as Senator Harradine pointed out so clearly in the debate earlier this week, that is not as effective a method of controlling the Minister as if he had to come to Parliament with amendments to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate only that, despite amendments that may have been made, other amendments that have been made to this legislation in the Committee stage make it even worse from our point of view. We remain extremely suspicious of the Government's intentions as to the composition of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the appointment of staff. As has been pointed out by Senator Reid, the Commission will be moved from Canberra to Sydney. That will cause a large number of resignations from the existing staff and opportunities for this Government to influence the appointment of new staff. It certainly gives the Government the opportunity to appoint virtually its own Commission. A new President and a new Human Rights Commissioner are to be appointed, and a new Race Discrimination Commissioner will be appointed because the Bill abolishes the present Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner has already been appointed by this Government, and that office is the only continuing one. The only office to be continued is the one appointed by the Government. We can rest assured that this Government will appoint people of its own political sympathies to these new positions. Rumours are rife that jobs for the boys are clearly in contemplation. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the passage of this legislation is a totally wrong course for Australia to take. We will continue to oppose it. I reiterate that our policy pledges to repeal this legislation and abolish this Commission, if the Senate passes the legislation, as unfortunately it seems hell-bent on doing because of the support of the Australian Democrats. I reiterate our opposition to it and our clear undertaking that on return to government this will be one of the first of a large number of statutory bodies that will be abolished. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose the States (Works and Housing) Assistance Amendment Bill 1986 but it is highly critical of the economic path we are on. Today I am particularly critical of the architect and operator of the Government's finances. Accordingly, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the end of the motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA> `, but the Senate condemns the Government for pursuing incompetent economic and tax policies which-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) have resulted in a continuing high level of interest rates; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) by the imposition of the iniquitous capital gains tax and the removal of negative gearing provisions, have reduced the incentive for private investors to put funds into the private rental market'. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw attention to the need of the States and the people of Australia for this funding at the moment. The demand for public housing is at an all time high. Between 31 December 1982 and 31 December 1985 the numbers on the waiting lists around Australia for public housing rose by 41.8 per cent, from 109,800 to 155,753. In Victoria the number increased from 15,323 to 29,306, an increase of 91.25 per cent under this Government. In New South Wales the number rose from 47,989 to 66,667, a rise of 38.92 per cent. In Victoria the delay in getting a house is now 24 months. In New South Wales it is 53 months. It is all very well waiting for a house, but one might have to wait a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent building commencement figures indicate that between the March quarter and the June quarter of 1986 the value of residential building commencements fell by 12 per cent and that the value of non-residential commencements fell by 10 per cent. From June 1985 to June 1986 the value of residential commencements declined by 21 per cent and the value of total building commencements declined by 15 per cent. The figures show the fall-off there has been in people's ability to obtain housing. Figures on the affordability factor produced by the Real Estate Institute of Australia indicate that in the 1985 June quarter it took 22.3 per cent of the average Australian worker's income to meet his mortgage instalment. By June 1986 this was up to 26.5 per cent. It is an alarming increase in the proportion of the expendable income of the average family. </PARA>
<PARA> Even worse, of course, is the fact that in Tasmania between June 1985 and June 1986 the monthly loan repayments on the average house went up by 36 per cent while wages went up by 5.8 per cent. Interest rates are between 16.5 and 17.5 per cent for ordinary home owners in Australia. That rate is about 10 per cent higher than that in most other reputable countries. This is what the Government has done to the families of Australia. We can add to this the disincentives to private rental ownership through the negative gearing provisions, capital gains tax and so on. The Government has much to answer for, but the Opposition does not delay the passage of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Cheques Bill and the Bills of Exchange Amendment Bill concurrently. The Opposition supports the purposes of both these Bills. The primary purpose of the Bills of Exchange Amendment Bill is to remove from the Bills of Exchange Act the operation it has on cheques, which will now be dealt with in the new Cheques Act. The Bills of Exchange Amendment Bill is, therefore, consequential upon the passage of the Cheques Bill. The Cheques Bill had a very long gestation period. It originated more than 20 years ago when the Manning Committee reviewed the Bills of Exchange Act and recommended that a new Act be passed dealing comprehensively with cheques. These two Bills were introduced into the House of Representatives on 22 May last year and reached the Senate in August of the same year. Now, at last, they are coming on for debate. For those interested in the Bills, it will be appropriate to refer to the second reading speech made then by the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Evans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, the Opposition agrees with the purposes of these two Bills and will support them. We also agree with the amendments to the Cheques Bill foreshadowed by the Government, which primarily provide protection for the non-bank financial institutions in the handling of cheques and payment orders. The introduction of these amendments justifies the stand taken by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats when the Cheques Bill was introduced last year. Then, the Government urged us to pass the Bill with the promise that it would subsequently look into the problems of the non-bank financial institutions. We obeyed the old rule: When you have them by the ears, their hearts and minds will follow. We refused to pass the Cheques Bill until it was appropriately amended, and the results are before us. I am sure that, if we had done what the Government had wanted and passed the Bill, we would never have seen these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments fully meet the concerns that the Opposition had with the Cheques Bill in its original form. They are necessary because there has been a tremendous change in financial institutions in the 22 years since the Manning Committee reported. There has been a great expansion not only in the number of banks but also, more importantly, in the growth of the non-bank financial institutions, some of which provide many bank-type services. At this point I should declare an interest to the Senate. I am a director of a building society, but I hasten to say that I will gain no financial benefit from the passage of this Bill or any of its amendments. My involvement with building societies has made me aware of the limitations on desirable building society activities caused by the lack of proper legislation for non-bank financial institutions. My position is, perhaps, comparable to that of a lawyer who presses for improvements in the operation of the legal system, perhaps in the area of legal aid as I know Senator Evans has done. In this place we should use the expertise of our members to the advantage of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk about the problems of the present lack of proper legislation for payment services for customers of non-bank financial institutions. They affect credit unions as well as building societies. Building societies are operating in a highly competitive financial market. A building society requires a margin of about 3 per cent between the average cost of its funds and the average return it gets from its loans which are, predominantly, home mortgages. The lending rates on mortgages are set by the various State governments and it is obviously desirable that these be kept as low as practicable while, of course, permitting the building societies to remain financially viable. Their tight financial position comes from the fact that these mortgage rates are lower than the rates which investors can get on their funds from deposits with other banks and other financial institutions. The days when little old ladies left their savings in savings banks at derisory rates of interest are well and truly over. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am corrected by Senator Puplick. If building societies are to attract a substantial proportion of their funds at below the ordinary market rate in today's sophisticated financial climate, they must provide appropriate services to their depositors. Otherwise, there is no way they will attract low interest funds. If they do not, home mortgage rates will go through the roof. In recent years building societies have attempted to attract low interest deposits by providing telephone bill paying services, by the introduction of an industry plastic card called `Cashcard' and the use of an Australia-wide automatic teller machine network. At present there are over one million Cashcards on issue and 450 ATMs installed. Building societies are developing the use of Cashcard to pay bills in large retail businesses such as supermarkets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The trouble is that the costs of these services are all high. The operating cost per transaction is more than $2. Any improved payment mechanism that reduces costs to a building society will reduce overall costs and will directly lead to lower interest rates. The use of cheques is the obvious solution. One option is for a building society or credit union to act as agent for a bank, but this has a number of very unsatisfactory features. The name of the bank must be prominently displayed on the cheque and, as the bank is, in practice, a competitor of the building society or credit union, those institutions are being forced to display publicly the name of a competitor. The bank can then gain details of customers who draw large cheques. It is very expensive and difficult for building societies or credit unions to change banks. In fact, the building society or credit union is locked in to a particular bank and the bank can impose its own credit conditions and indemnities. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the building society or credit union may have significant legal problems. If the building society is issuing cheques as an agent for a bank, the cheques are drawn on the building society's account with the bank. The person drawing the cheque has an account with the building society. The bank, of course, refers to the building society before meeting the payment; but, if the cheque is stopped because of insufficient funds held by the drawer with the building society, the building society may have significant legal problems. It is almost essential, for obvious market reasons, for the building society to put its own name as well as that of the bank on the cheque. The holder of the cheque could sue the building society for the funds, both because of the appearance of the building society's name on the cheque and also because the building society's account with the bank, which has stopped payment of the cheque, would be in funds. This is a very dangerous exposure for a building society or credit union. </PARA>
<PARA> Practically speaking, banks are happy for building societies or credit unions to issue cheques as long as it is done in as difficult, expensive and dangerous a way as possible. That is what happens when a building society or credit union issues cheques as an agent for a bank. I do not criticise this attitude of banks. It is very understandable. They, too, are in a highly competitive environment and, if they are given opportunities to hobble competitors, it would be unreasonable to expect them to resist. Our job as legislators is to see that there is a fair go for all the competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> What should be done, and what is being done by the amendments foreshadowed by Senator Evans, is that non-bank financial institutions should be able to issue payment orders in their own name and on their own responsibility, and similar protection should be given for all parties to these transactions as applies to cheques. Of course, for these payment orders to be useful there would have to be access to the cheque clearing system, which is a private arrangement among the banks and is not covered in this Bill. Banks admit newcomers to the cheque clearing system and very properly impose a joining fee of perhaps $1m. There is no way they would admit a building society or credit union to the cheque clearing system but the problem could be easily overcome-there would be no difficulty about this-by arranging for a bank to act as an agent to clear a building society's or credit union's payment orders through the cheque clearing system. </PARA>
<PARA> It will not be a major problem to change the bank which was clearing the cheques, therefore the building society or credit union would not be locked into a particular bank in the same way as it is now when issuing cheques as an agent for a bank. However, not all building societies or credit unions will wish to, or be suitable to, issue cheques in their own right and for them a continuation of the agency arrangements will be necessary. It will be necessary to protect them from being, as I mentioned before, sued on the instrument. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted the Government has recognised these problems and has now proposed the appropriate amendments to the Bill, for the problems are here and now for building societies and credit unions. They are issuing cheques here and now as agents for banks-they have to if they want to remain competitive-and they are very vulnerable to being sued, so vulnerable it is difficult to get insurance against it. The competition for low interest deposits is here and now and the need for building societies to issue payment orders is urgent if housing loan interest rates are to be contained. These amendments which Senator Evans has foreshadowed have been endorsed by the Australian Payments System Council which comprises building societies, credit unions, all the major banks, the Treasury and the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> I have one final matter. This is extremely technical, specialist and complex legislation and it appears to be very indifferently drafted. The text of the amendments was apparently received by the members of the Australian Payments System Council only a few days before the meeting, which did not, in the opinion of some members of the Council, permit adequate consideration of the details of the drafting. I understand some submissions will be made to the Attorney-General on the details of the drafting and if these are proposed they should be incorporated, provided, of course, that they are merely technical modifications and do not affect the basic thrust of the amendments. This legislation has been hanging around for a long time. I think we should get it through now and if any technical defects emerge perhaps they could be adjusted in the next Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. The Opposition supports the Bill and will support the Committee stage amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the Cheques Bill 1985 as it will be amended by the Government's amendments which have been circulated. When this legislation came before the Senate this year the Democrats and the Opposition made it clear, as Senator Hamer said, that we wished for some substantial amendments to ensure that major non-banking financial institutions in this country, particularly building societies and credit unions which make up the bulk of that area, would have access to the existing cheque clearance system used by the banks or an acceptable alternative clearance system which would protect and safeguard the rights of customers of those institutions. The Government amendments will give some recognition of the non-banking financial institutions part in the cheque payments system and will provide for a new negotiable instrument called a payment order which will basically be identical to a cheque except it will be drawn on a non-banking financial institution rather than on a bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice that Senator Hamer has declared some interest in this issue. I also have an interest as a longstanding member of, and supporter of the founding of, credit unions in Australia. Senator Hamer's comments, by and large, were directed at the building societies. I will add a few similar words with regard to credit unions which have been a major financial institution for many Australians. Many Australians have found that the types of services provided by their local credit unions have been what they require. The credit union to which I belong was the first credit union in Queensland to provide automatic tellers, long before building societies or banks got anywhere near doing so. Credit unions have been at the breaking edge of most of the innovations in offering new financial services to members. In that way they have been able to attract and increase the number of people who wish to do the majority of their financial arrangements with credit unions, outside of those which are almost exclusively within the province of the banks and building societies-the purchase of a home. These people have chosen to do most of their normal financial transactions through their local credit union. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the diversity of these institutions has added competition in the Australian system where there was no effective competition previously. The Government, in terms of its deregulation of the banks, which the Australian Democrats did not support, opened up the system. Before the Bill was introduced, we argued that before proceeding to that deregulation there should have been some reference to our other financial institutions to provide them with a variety of means of competing even more effectively than they have to date with the banks. By these amendments the Government has provided at least some of these opportunities. Credit unions and building societies will no longer be at the mercy of the banks if in fact they wish to provide a comparable facility to cheques to their customers. </PARA>
<PARA> Most credit unions currently provide bank cheques and act as agents, as Senator Hamer has already pointed out. Under the legislation they will be able to operate on their own. I expect some rigorous competition in this area. For example, credit unions, by and large, offer free cheques and a much more comprehensive reporting mechanism than the banks have been willing to provide to date. I believe, with this innovation, the credit unions and the building societies will inject even further strenuous competition for the ordinary citizen's dollar, and that is what we are talking about. These amendments are not directed at the major companies in this country or the various people who deal in the broader spectrum of finance; they are directed specifically at the ordinary citizens who deposit money in an account to be able to write cheques and to try to balance their books and to get smaller loans for things which suit them. We welcome the Government's flexibility in being able to propose these amendments. We believe that this minor but significant movement to break the monopoly of banks will be only to the good of the people of this country. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendments were the subject of a good deal of discussion at the second reading stage. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a plain English explanatory account of what these amendments are all about. Essentially, they enable customers of non-bank financial institutions to issue a new instrument to be called a payment order which will be similar to a cheque, except that it will be drawn on a customer's account, not with a bank, but with a non-bank. That is what they are essentially about. There are many other lesser provisions, but primarily they are directed to that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is moving amendments to the Cheques Bill 1985 to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) enable customers of non-bank financial institutions (non-banks) to issue a new instrument to be called a `payment order' which will be similar to a cheque, except that it will be drawn on a customer's account with a non-bank;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) transfer liability on so called `agency' cheques from non-banks to their customers and to protect non-bank customers who use these `agency' cheques;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) extend protections afforded banks collecting cheques to non-banks performing that function and to impose a duty on non-banks to ensure prompt presentment of cheques lodged with them for collection on behalf of their customers; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) clarify some provisions presently contained in the Cheques Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> For the most part, these amendments implement recommendations of the Australian Payments System Council which was established by the Government to examine the most desirable means by which non-banks could gain access to the payment system. </PARA>
<PARA>(1) Payment orders (cls 96e to Q)</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> These amendments provide for a new negotiable instrument to be called a payment order which would be identical, in all significant respects, to a cheque except that it would be drawn on a non-bank rather than a bank and would bear the words `payment order' across it. </PARA>
<PARA> Non-banks have for some time been anxious, for obvious marketing reasons, to be able to issue their own paper on the same basis that banks issue cheques. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed clauses 96e to Q, together with the Schedule to be inserted, provide for payment orders and regulate their use in the same manner as cheques are currently regulated in the Bill. This would mean that non-bank customers drawing these payment orders would enjoy similar rights and protections as apply to cheques. Likewise, non-banks would be under the same duties and have the same protections as banks using cheques. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted, however, that the amendments do not confer on non-banks issuing payment orders direct access to the cheque clearing system. As with `agency' cheques at present, non-banks would need to negotiate commercial arrangements with banks to clear their orders unless they establish their own clearing house for such orders. </PARA>
<PARA> A definition of `non-bank financial institution' is being inserted in the Bill for the purposes of the `agency' cheque and payment order provisions. `Non-bank financial institution' will be defined to mean a building society or credit union that is a registered corporation within the meaning of the Financial Corporations Act 1974, or any other registered corporation that is prescribed or included in a class of registered corporations, that is prescribed. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of non-bank financial institution has been drafted to ensure that building societies and credit unions are subject to the proposed new provisions of the Bill. It has been those two groups of institutions which, to date, have been pressing, through the Australian Payments System Council, for legislative protections to enhance their access to the domestic payments system. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the definition allows for other institutions, or groups of institutions, wishing at some later stage to gain the benefits of the protections included in the new provisions to be prescribed. Since responsibility for maintaining stability and public confidence in the domestic payments system lies with the Treasurer, it is envisaged that he would play a role in the determination of which institutions should be prescribed and thus which institutions should participate in the payments system. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) Agency cheques (cl 96d)</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendment dealing with `agency' cheques (ie cheques drawn by a non-bank on its own bank and signed by the non-bank customer) is designed to overcome difficulties which currently exist with the use of `agency' cheques:</PARA>
<PARA> From the point of view of non-banks, `agency' cheques suffer from the defect that, as the drawer of such cheques, non-banks may be liable to a payee/holder in the event of dishonour or countermand. </PARA>
<PARA> From the point of view of customers, `agency' cheques are unsatisfactory in that there is effectively no banker/customer relationship established between the bank and the customer or possibly even the NBFI and the customer. Hence some of the protections available to bank customers are not presently applicable in respect of `agency' cheques. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed clause 96d is therefore designed to overcome these defects by ensuring that non-bank customers using `agency' cheques have similar rights as drawers of cheques in relation to their non-bank. As well the liability on `agency' cheques of non-banks as drawers will be transferred to their customers as regards holders or indorsers of those cheques. </PARA>
<PARA>(3) Non-banks collecting cheques (duties and protections) (cls 96a to c)</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Proposed clauses 96a, 96b and 96c deal with the processing of cheques lodged with non-banks by their customers. The clauses will:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) impose on non-banks substantially similar obligations to those which banks have under clause 66 of the Bill to holders of cheques who lodge cheques with banks for collection (96a), and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) provide protection to non-banks when cheques are lodged with them by their customers along the lines of that conferred on banks under clause 95 (96b and c)</PARA>
<PARA> These new provisions reflect the Government's view that it is appropriate for non-banks to enjoy the same protections, and be under the same obligations, as banks when they are performing the same function. </PARA>
<PARA>Summary</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The overall effect of this comprehensive package of amendments would be to place non-banks and their customers, whether using `agency' cheques or payment orders, in a similar position to banks and their customers who use `ordinary' cheques. </PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that the legislation will come into operation by 1 July next year. Amendments to the Commonwealth Bank Accounts Debits Tax Administration Act 1982 will be required to be in place by then to ensure that payment orders are treated in the same manner as cheques for taxation purposes. This legislation is expected to be introduced early next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Science and Industry Research Legislation Amendment Bill 1986, I will try to make a 30-minute speech in about five minutes. So if it should become a little disjointed, it will be because I am trying to put pieces together. Briefly, the legislation represents the Government's response to the report of the Australian Science and Technology Council inquiry entitled `Future Directions for CSIRO', which was delivered to the Government about 12 months ago. It was noticeable that the second reading speech of the Minister for Science (Mr Barry Jones), which consists of about 13 pages, did not really touch on the legislation until after about 9 1/2 pages. Again, I suppose there is nothing unusual about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister stated that the legislation was based on the ASTEC report. I find that fairly hard to agree with, because when I checked on the Government's response to the recommendations and what it had done, I found that, of the 31 recommendations or sub-recommendations, the Government accepted only these three: That the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation be retained as a single statutory authority; that the existing CSIRO Advisory Council and State and Territory committees be discontinued; and that the CSIRO introduce an early separation incentive scheme. It did accept seven recommendations, with qualifications. It rejected seven recommendations outright and there were 14 on which no action was taken. It is tampering with the truth a little to say that the legislation is based on the ASTEC report. It is an important piece of legislation. It shows that the Government has been considering the matter. It shows that it recognises that there are changes necessary in the operation of the CSIRO. I believe it is important that we pass it as speedily as possible so that it can get on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA>Science and Industry Research Amendment Bill</PARA>
<PARA> I am not terribly pleased with the extent of the legislation. I suggest that it will need to be watched and a certain amount of further amendments will be needed once we see what is working and what is not working. It fails to come to grips with two or three of the most important recommendations. There is the question of the accessibility of the CSIRO and its relationship with the Public Service Board. I believe it is terribly important that we should sever this connection as fast as possible. Nearly everybody seems to agree, or seems to have agreed, on this. At this stage ASTEC certainly favours it. I know that the CSIRO and the Opposition favour it. I know that the scientific community in general favours it, and I know that until very recently even the Australian Labor Party favoured it. It was part of its policy from 1982 to 1986. But in 1986 it suddenly changed its policy. I suggest that it should have another look at it, if it wants the CSIRO to become a more vigorous and free operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation fails to do anything about the portability of superannuation of staff. This is a major question. I believe that until we allow people to mix working with the Organisation with working in industry, universities and other academic places, we will not improve the overall status of the academic staff. I urge the Government to proceed to do something about that as quickly as it possibly can. On the question of multi-occupations, I firmly believe that more people in the CSIRO and in universities should have an industry background. I urge that we make all the necessary provisions so that people in industry are able to go to and from the CSIRO, and people in the CSIRO should be able to go to and from industry. I also believe that they should be able to share in the rewards of the discoveries and research in which they engage, wherever that is possible. As far as the committees are concerned, I am advised that it is the intention of the Minister to reorganise committees on a State basis and to have committees for other consultation. Naturally, I would like to see how this works, because I find it difficult at the moment to read in the legislation how this will be done. But I hope that it can be achieved, and we will await the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The reindustrialisation of Australia starts with the CSIRO. We will have to look to it to do more with industry. The organisation is world renowned. There is not another institution in Australia that is as favourably known around the world as the CSIRO. The places in the Organisation that I have visited over the last 12 to 14 months have shown that there are many great and interesting people, as there have been in the past. I wish to acknowledge the work that they have done and the calibre of their work. I pay particular tribute to Dr Boardman, who over the last 12 months has been through a very difficult period while there have been all the uncertainties and who has been able to maintain staff morale at a very high level. While paying tribute, I should also mention Sir Peter Derham and the CSIRO Advisory Council, which as of today, tomorrow or the next few days will not exist any more. We need to remember that the Council, whether it is regarded as having been successful or not, has done what it was required to do. I think it could have done more had it been allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vigor has made various arrangements with the Minister for Science and we have agreed to accept various undertakings which have been given by the Minister rather than move amendments in the Senate at this stage. I regret that more adequate debate was not possible. In normal circumstances there would have been several speakers on the Bill but we do not wish to impede the progress of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Science and Industry Research Legislation Bill 1986 is an important Bill as it concerns the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia's foremost applied research organisation. The Bill implements some of the recommendations of the Australian Science and Technology Council report and as such we support the provisions of the Bill. However, we have raised with the Minister for Science (Mr Barry Jones) several areas in which the Bill fails to implement the ASTEC recommendations. The major one in our view is the failure to cope with the area of intellectual property. ASTEC recommended that the rights to an income from inventions be divided between the inventors and CSIRO and that CSIRO be allowed to retain its earnings from such inventions. Most honourable senators would realise that this recommendation is becoming increasingly important in relation to not only the CSIRO but also our other research institutions, mainly within universities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the CSIRO moves away more and more from pure research, fairly obviously in the area of applied research and the development of inventions, increasingly a number of commercial possibilities will open up. Because of the failure to implement this recommendation this avenue is likely to be denied or at the very least delayed. Scientists will be denied the reward and incentives that go with their innovative effort. More and more overseas, scientists and engineers are being given intellectual property rights through patent ownership or some other mechanism. This provides an incentive for extra effort which may be needed to bring inventions up to scratch for development. It also gives a strong competitive market for people with talent. It is important that Australia's premier research organisation should be able to attract and retain the most inventive people who are available to it. Intellectual property rights obviously must be part of the package. The Australian Democrats intended to move an amendment to the Bill but agreed not to do so because of the urgent need to get the proposed council in place. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the amendment which the Australian Democrats proposed to move to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Page 14, paragraph 25 (a), line 36, leave out the paragraph, insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(a) by omitting sub-section (1) and substituting the following sub-sections:</PARA>
<PARA> `(1) The property in a discovery, invention or improvement of or in any process, apparatus or machine made, after the commencement of section 25 of the Science and Industry Research Legislation Amendment Act 1986, by an officer or officers of the Organisation in the course of the official duties of that officer or those officers shall be held in common by the Organisation and that officer or those officers in such shares as, in accordance with the regulations, reflect the relative contributions of the Organisation and the officer or officers concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> `(1a) Where the Organisation and a partner of the Organisation or a company in the formation of which the Organisation has joined hold, whether jointly or in unequal shares, the property in a discovery, invention or improvement of or in any process, apparatus or machine made, after the commencement of section 25 of the Science and Industry Research Legislation Amendment Act 1986, by an officer or officers of the Organisation in the course of the official duties of that officer or those officers, whether or not in conjunction with an officer or employee of the partner or the company, the property of the Organisation in that discovery, invention or improvement of or in any process, apparatus or machine shall be held in common by the Organisation and that officer or those officers of the Organisation in such shares as, in accordance with the regulations, reflect the relative contributions of the Organisation and the officer or officers concerned.';''. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Minister for Science, Mr Barry Jones, gave Senator Vigor, the Australian Democrats spokesperson in this area, an undertaking that he would ensure that the spirit of the ASTEC recommendations would be implemented by the new Board of the CSIRO after suitable investigations of alternatives. That was part of the discussion in the House of Representatives. Therefore, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a paragraph from the Minister's speech at the third reading stage in which he actually gives the undertaking. I think this would save the time of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The paragraph read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The second is recommendation 23-the ownership of intellectual property rights. This again is a very complex issue and something that is a matter of profound concern not just to CSIRO but to universities and research based companies, both locally and internationally. It is particularly complex in international companies such as International Business Machines and AT and T, which have an enormous concentration on research capability. We need to get it right because, remember, whatever happens at CSIRO will undoubtedly be adopted as a model throughout the Australian community. Australian Democrats senators have suggested proposing an amendment to try to provide for what they thought ought to be changes here and now and put it in the legislation. I think that is slightly premature and I ask them, in the interests of giving the Science and Industry Research Legislation Amendment Bill a speedy passage so that the new Board can be appointed-I would hope that it will be operating perhaps even before the end of this month, because it is very important that we get things moving before the long hiatus of the Christmas break-to hold back such an amendment on my giving an undertaking to ensure that the spirit of recommendation 23 will be implemented by the Board, again preferably after seeking expert advice in this tricky area, and I now give that undertaking. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. One major reform advocated by ASTEC is the removal of the nexus between CSIRO and the Public Service Board which constrains the conditions of employment to fit in with the patterns of the rest of the Public Service. The needs and reward sought by research scientists and engineers are not the same as those sought by the Public Service in general, nor can a research program be mapped out and controlled in the same way as can general Public Service duties. Flexibility in employment and mobility of research people are essential ingredients in a dynamic and innovative research and development team. Close ties with industry are absolutely desirable, as they are with teaching institutions such as universities, colleges of advanced education and private institutions, which more and more are moving into the area of research. For these reasons we see it as absolutely mandatory that this come about to enable CSIRO to reach its optimum potential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have considerable reservations about the proposal to introduce forward planning of research programs with funding tied to these. The nature of research is such that the outcomes are not readily predictable. The most valuable spin-offs from research are often just that-valuable spin-offs which were not even contemplated at the beginning of the research program. If a group is tied in any rigid way to the completion of a program in a fixed time, an investigation of these valuable spin-offs may be inhibited. That does not seem to us to be a useful way of dealing with the whole research thrust. However, we have accepted the Minister's assurances that the strategic plans and annual operating plans will not be coercive but will allow openness and accountability. We retain our misgivings but will monitor this. The Minister has given that undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> In a similar vein, there were discussions with the Minister regarding wastage which may occur through annual budgeting since most research and development programs are of a longer duration. The early termination of a program can effectively throw away all the money that has been invested up to that point. For this reason the Australian Democrats would like to see a move towards triennial or even quintennial rolling budgets for the Organisation. We believe that would guarantee a safer return on the money which is to be invested by the Commonwealth but it would still allow for annual reviews. We feel that that might be the most appropriate way to deal with that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> As on other legislation, we deplore the trend to remove more and more of Parliament's power to intervene, by the use of ministerial powers rather than the regulation which is subject to scrutiny. In our view this does not allow for full accountability. The Parliament is presented time and again merely with a fait accompli. The final point I should like to make concerns the change in name which is inherent in the change from `z' to `s' in the spelling of `Organisation'. There is a long tradition attached to the name. I suppose that some people will be concerned. The Minister has assured us that the current stationery will be used. I am sure that when the new stationery is printed nobody will even notice the change. Whilst the spelling change is mandatory, it is nice that at least the old stationery will be used. Other concerns were raised with the Minister. They are contained in a 1 1/2-page letter from the Minister to Senator Vigor. In view of the time constraints, I seek leave to have the letter incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Vigor</PARA>
<PARA> During our discussions on Sunday, 8 November and yesterday about the Science and Industry Research Legislation Amendment Bill, you provided me with a copy of your six proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest priority now is to secure the speediest possible passage of the legislation so that the new Board can be appointed and begin operating before the Christmas-New Year hiatus. </PARA>
<PARA> Following our original discussions I dealt with your two major difficulties (Nos. 1 and 3 on your list)-intellectual property rights and CSIRO's relationship with the Public Service Board-in the resumed debate on the Bill (House of Representatives, 13 November 1986, p. 2995) which I commend to you. The Minister representing me in the Senate, Senator Button, will no doubt repeat what I told the House and you-that both matters will be examined speedily, and preferably by an arms length inquiry, by the incoming Board and resolved, as necessary, in a statute law revision Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministerial powers of direction (No. 2) have only been exercised twice in the 60 year history of CSIR/CSIRO, and then only once on a major matter, and there is full accountability and reporting to the Parliament. I see no practical need to provide a set of regulations to cover so remote a contingency. </PARA>
<PARA> Requirements for strategic plans (No. 4) reflect the need for greater openness and accountability in the Organisation and should help Divisions and Institutes to plan their operations more effectively. They are not intended to be coercive, but in any case the Organisation cannot retreat to the closet. Proposals for strategic plans actually originated in CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA> Arguments for triennial or quinquennial funding (No. 5) have obvious attractions-and to a large extent CSIRO already uses `rolling funding' internally. Most Ministers would like to find a three or five year pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. I doubt if a Senate amendment would bring it about.</PARA>
<PARA> No. 6 in your list-and I am uncertain if this suggests a higher or low priority-concerns changing the spelling of Organization to Organisation. I will ensure that existing stationery is subject to natural attrition and that this change will not be ruinously expensive to CSIRO or prejudicial to research. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly, it would be self defeating to create a Board structure and fail to give it the opportunity to make a contribution on significant policy issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I would appreciate your forbearance in not proposing formal amendments and accepting my assurances in the spirit they are given. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> As 1986 draws to a close, and as the Parliament prepares to conclude its deliberations for the year, I take this opportunity to review for the Senate the efforts made by the Government and the Australian community to advance the objectives of the International Year of Peace. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a year in which the Australian community has given vigorous and articulate expression to its desire to help build a more peaceful world. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, 1986 has been a year in which Australians have been given greater grounds for hope than for many years that the threat of nuclear war will be significantly diminished. </PARA>
<PARA>East-West Relations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Before dealing with our national contribution to the IYP, let me say something about the international background to Australia's efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> In a speech at the University of New England in September the Prime Minister said that historic opportunities existed for the restoration of stability and realistic understanding between the super-powers. There was the prospect of less suspicion and tension than had been the case for a decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, the renewed intensity of negotiations on nuclear and space arms found dramatic expression at the meeting in Reykjavik between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, there was disappointment in Australia and around the world at the failure in Reykjavik to reach final agreement on the truly breathtaking set of proposals which was discussed there. We should recognise, however, that during 1986 a fundamental transformation has occurred in the nature of the super-power dialogue on security issues. The United States and the Soviet Union have begun to cut through to the very essence of the profound differences that separate them in these negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> Significant in this regard was the successful outcome in Stockholm at the Conference on Confidence and Security Building measures and Disarmament in Europe. This, the first East-West accord in security matters in seven years, indicated a new determination to restore momentum to the process of arms control and disarmament after years of stalemate. </PARA>
<PARA> Significantly, the Stockholm agreement also saw the acceptance for the first time by the Soviet Union and its allies of a system of mandatory on-site inspections to verify compliance with the information-exchange provisions. Greater openness in such matters is essential if real progress is to be made in disarmament and arms control. </PARA>
<PARA> The road ahead will not be easy. But there is no doubt that we are on the right road and I believe there are grounds to be optimistic that the super-powers are determined to stay on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has received regular and detailed briefings from the United States on progress in these matters and the Government has taken full advantage of numerous opportunities to inject our views at the highest levels on both sides on how progress might be further achieved. We will continue to urge progress with all the force we have. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister has frequently said, one cannot exaggerate Australia's role and influence in these matters. But it is our firm conviction that we have the right and responsibility to be heard on issues of peace, arms control and disarmament. And we have been. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding our differences with the United States on some issues of principle such as the Strategic Defence Initiative, the very healthy state of our relationship has enabled us to maintain a close and productive dialogue with Washington. And, while not seeking to ignore the gulf in strategic orientation and ideological perception which separates us from the Soviet Union, we have restored sensible contact with Moscow, without which any Australian arms control and disarmament policy would be meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has written on several occasions to President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev this year, making clear the importance that the Australian Government attaches to continued compliance with the SALT II Treaty. He conveyed our view that the Soviet Union has a case to answer on specific compliance issues, but that Australia was no less concerned at the US announcement in May that future decisions on the structure of its strategic forces would no longer be bound by SALT II limitations. </PARA>
<PARA> We will continue to make our voice heard. </PARA>
<PARA> In a variety of other ways, the Government has been very active in the pursuit of peace and disarmament in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone (SPNFZ) Treaty</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This year marks a historic moment for disarmament in the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Senate passes the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty Bill and related legislation currently before it, Australia will be in a position to ratify the Treaty of Rarotonga. Our ratification will be the eighth, and will bring the Treaty into force. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only does the Treaty represent a major disarmament achievement, it also makes a positive contribution to regional security. </PARA>
<PARA> The countries of the South Pacific Forum have built upon existing international treaties to make a new treaty that will help preserve the South Pacific as it is today:</PARA>
<PARA> free from nuclear weapons stationed in the countries and territories of the region;</PARA>
<PARA> free from nuclear waste dumping; and</PARA>
<PARA> with the tragic (and we hope temporary) exception of French Polynesia, free from nuclear testing. </PARA>
<PARA> All the countries of the region want to preserve these freedoms and that is the central purpose of the Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context, the Government is very pleased that countries of the South Pacific, along with the United States and France, agreed in principle on 25 November to adopt the text of a Convention for the Protection and Development of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region (the SPREP Convention). </PARA>
<PARA> The Convention complements the Treaty of Rarotonga's prohibition on radioactive waste dumping at sea in the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treaty does not seek to undermine the favourable security environment which the South Pacific enjoys. It does not in any way conflict with Australia's defence arrangements, notably ANZUS. </PARA>
<PARA> On the contrary, the Treaty of Rarotonga seeks to build on the factors that have created and sustained the security of the region to help ensure that the South Pacific, unlike other parts of the world, does not in the future become a theatre for nuclear confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Protocols to the Treaty adopted in final form by the South Pacific Forum in August this year will be open for signature on 1 December. These provide for the United States, the United Kingdom and France to apply provisions of the Treaty to their South Pacific Territories and for the nuclear-weapon states (the United States, the USSR, the United Kingdom, France and China) to undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against parties to the Treaty nor to conduct nuclear testing in the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's strong hope that all the eligible states, which have major responsibility for international peace and security, will adhere to the Protocols to the Treaty of Rarotonga. </PARA>
<PARA> The significance of the Bill before the Senate goes further than clearing the way for the entry into force of the Treaty of Rarotonga, important though that is. For, in passing the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty Bill, Australia will become one of the first independent, sovereign countries in the world to make a commitment by national legislation against the nuclear weapons option. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill commits this and future Governments to prohibit the manufacture, acquisition and possession of nuclear explosive devices and the stationing and testing of such devices within Australia's territory. We take great pride in this stand. </PARA>
<PARA> It is deeply regrettable that the Opposition in the House of Representatives saw fit to oppose this historic declaration of principle. I urge them to review their position when the legislation comes before the Senate next week. </PARA>
<PARA>Comprehensive Test Ban</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> During 1986, the Australian Government has continued to attach the highest priority in our multilateral disarmament diplomacy to the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban (CTB). </PARA>
<PARA> Such a treaty would ban all kinds of nuclear tests in all environments by all countries for all time. It is a feasible and negotiable proposal whose implementation would be an important step towards preventing horizontal and vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this month, the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly voted on several resolutions dealing with nuclear testing. Two of these resolutions were sponsored by Australia and both received overwhelming support. </PARA>
<PARA> The first was the Australia-New Zealand resolution on a comprehensive test ban which reaffirms the fundamental importance of such a treaty and sets out a program of action to achieve it. Five CTB resolutions were considered by the Committee this year. Australia's resolution, which has the best chances of contributing to a nuclear-free world, received 117 positive votes, the highest number of any of the five. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australia-New Zealand resolution was co-sponsored by 26 countries including Sweden, Canada and Japan. The United States and Britain, who had opposed our resolution in 1985, abstained this year. Only France voted against. This excellent result reflected the international community's acknowledgment of Australia's realistic approach and deep commitment to the early conclusion of a CTB Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Australian resolution considered this year calls on the nuclear testing states to make public each test and to provide certain data including the size of the test and the geology of the test site. This was a new initiative and the resolution received 107 positive votes. Only one country-France-opposed the resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>Chemical Weapons</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The abolition of chemical weapons has long been a high priority objective of the Australian Government's arms control and disarmament policies. We have made special efforts during 1986 to facilitate progress on effective international measures against such abhorrent weapons. Australia is at the forefront of international action to this end. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government is committed to the early conclusion of a comprehensive Chemical Weapons Convention which would ban the production, stockpiling and use of all chemical weapons and provide for the destruction of all existing stocks of chemical weapons and their production facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been prominent at both the diplomatic and technical levels in the negotiations on chemical weapons at the Conference on Disarmament. During 1986 Australia chaired one of the Conference's three working groups on chemical weapons which made considerable progress. We have also actively supported and participated in investigations by the UN Secretary-General into reports of the use of chemical weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> We have instituted controls on the export of particular chemicals which could be used in the manufacture of chemical weapons. In addition, Australia convened consultations during 1986 with eighteen Western countries (known as the `Australia Group') which have adopted similar controls with a view to co-ordinating such measures internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> These outstanding results in the cause of peace and disarmament were only made possible by the strong and sustained commitment of the Government to achieving real progress on arms control, a field in which little can be done without detailed expertise in the issues, international acceptance of the contribution we can make and the skills of sensitive diplomacy and negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, from the moment it came to office, set about establishing for the first time in Australia's history, the necessary credentials for successful work in the field of disarmament. </PARA>
<PARA> The highest credit for our success belongs to my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bill Hayden, whose skill, initiative and energy have won his worldwide respect and regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also acknowledge the efforts of our officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs, and those of our Ambassador for Disarmament. </PARA>
<PARA>Ideals of the International Year of Peace</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> So far, I have talked about the international background to the International Year of Peace and the Government's own disarmament activities. </PARA>
<PARA> In resolving to give its strong support to the United Nations' designation of 1986 as the International Year of Peace (IYP), the Government reaffirmed the high priority it has consistently placed on arms control and disarmament but, at the same time, agreed with the view of the United Nations that IYP activities should not be sponsored only at the level of national governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Government sought to encourage the wide range of individuals and community organisations in Australia who had set high value on the opportunities this year offered them to express their views and make their own contribution to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The search for international peace habitually attracts close attention from both cynics and utopians. Cynics say that military confrontation is inevitable and that no generation in history has been totally free from the threat of war. For their part, utopians are so eager for peace that they trust the panaceas of unilateral disarmament and isolationism, ignoring the unfortunate history of such policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The view of this Government, however, is that to work for real peace is neither to ignore reality nor to neglect security. </PARA>
<PARA> During the IYP, we have witnessed again and again the yearning for peace among people in Australia, especially our young people. We hear their conviction that there are better alternatives to the threats under which we live and that there are better uses for human and material resources than the accumulation of weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the IYP has provided a timely opportunity for people throughout the world to find ways of achieving progress towards the peace we all seek. </PARA>
<PARA>IYP Program</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The planning of the IYP program fell within the portfolio of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bill Hayden, and again, he deserves full credit for his determination that the noble idea behind the IYP was fully and appropriately celebrated in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist him in planning and implementing the program Mr Hayden appointed Mrs Stella Cornelius, the prominent community activist, as IYP Director. He also established IYP Committees both at the National level and in each of the States and Territories with members drawn from a broad range of community organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to Mrs Cornelius' tireless and dedicated work for the objectives of the IYP and to the members of the various committees who gave so freely of their time and energy to make the program a success. I should also like to acknowledge the generous support given to the IYP by State Governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government approved a budget of $3.15 million for the IYP Program in Australia. These funds were divided on a roughly equal basis between three main components of the program:</PARA>
<PARA> Information and advertising;</PARA>
<PARA> A series of Government projects; and</PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the vital role of the community, $1,050,000 to support non-government projects. </PARA>
<PARA> You will have seen the IYP advertisements on radio and television. Those advertisements were designed to relate to peace in all its meanings, and to counter despair and apathy with the message that, while peace is not easy to achieve, it is not impossible and every attempt at progress is a ``Step in the Right Direction''. </PARA>
<PARA> The media campaign was complemented by the production and wide distribution of 20,000 Peace Kits containing detailed information on Australia's role and achievements in disarmament and arms control and suggestions as to ways in which local communities might participate in the program. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to encourage better public understanding of the complexities of international arms control, the Government sponsored a number of projects, which included a series of public arms control and disarmament seminars in State capital cities and an international symposium on Seismic Verification, a vital technical precondition for a possible Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's IYP program was officially launched by the ``Overture of Peace'', a concert by over 2000 NSW school students which was televised nationally in February. As an optimistic, joyful celebration of peace it was a fitting beginning to the year. </PARA>
<PARA> That event also symbolised the strong connection the Government saw between the International Year of Peace and the immediately preceding International Year of Youth. </PARA>
<PARA> The enthusiasm and commitment of our young people for the goal of peace obvious at that occasion asserted itself again at His Holiness the Pope's peace rally in Sydney on Tuesday night. </PARA>
<PARA> Just over a month ago the Prime Minister presented Australian Peace Awards to Australians who had made outstanding contributions to peace in many areas of activity. In establishing these Awards during the IYP, the Government sought to give fitting recognition to both the quality and diversity of community achievements in work for a peaceful future. </PARA>
<PARA> These same elements were also reflected to an overwhelming degree in the non-government IYP projects organised and carried out by individuals and community organisations in every part of the country. Many of these received financial support from the Federal Government. We are also aware of many more community projects which have been mounted quite independently of any Government assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Non-government projects for the IYP have involved the Churches, peace groups, academics, the Aboriginal community, artists, teachers, school students, welfare organisations, ethnic groups, women's organisations, the RSL, service clubs, trade unions and many others. The projects have included conferences and seminars, theatrical performances and concerts, publications, videos, educational and research programs. They have taken place in every part of Australia, from the largest cities to the smallest rural towns. </PARA>
<PARA> So impressive was this response to the IYP that the UN Secretary-General sent a personal message commending Australian community groups for their enthusiasm and commitment. Three UN Secretariat officials who visited Australia to familiarise themselves with our IYP program were particularly impressed with its unique combination of Government and non-government activities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from this great community response that the IYP has been a great success in Australia. Not only have Australians become more aware of why they should care about international events around them but they have also demonstrated their strong concern to leave the world at peace for the benefit of future generations. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been achieved this year is a firmer basis for continuing work for peace in the future both by the Government and the Australian community as a whole. The heightened awareness of the issues and sense of responsibility for a world of peace which the IYP has generated will not end on 31 December 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to address some concluding words to young Australians, who more than any of us, have made their concerns about peace felt this year and whose responsibility it will be in the future to shoulder the burden of securing peace. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned that the Prime Minister spoke earlier this year to an audience at the University of New England in Armidale. Let me conclude now with his concluding message. </PARA>
<PARA> Do not succumb to the paralysis of despair. It would be a tragedy if our young people, in particular, were to be so weighed down at the remote prospect of nuclear war as not to care adequately about their own self development or to contribute to our society in a positive and energetic way. Seek to decode the often confusing language of arms control, its acronyms and its technical jargon. Do not allow the so-called experts to monopolise the debate. Inform yourselves fully about the difficult international issues involved. Effective arms control will only come about through incremental, careful and patiently negotiated steps. Do not become overwhelmed by pessimism at the sometimes glacial speed of progress in disarmament negotiations. Above all, do not fail to let the political leadership of this country, and of the international community, know of your desire for tangible progress towards a saner, safer world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the subject of peace is a most important event because there is no question whatever that the subject of peace is the great issue of our time throughout the world. I place on record the Opposition's strong support for the cause of peace and for the work we believe we have done in a bipartisan cause during this International Year of Peace. The reason for the Prime Minister's statement is that it is the last opportunity in this International Year of Peace, 1986, to wrap up the debate that has been going on at a heightened level as a result of that occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We in the Opposition have played our part in the International Year of Peace. We established at the Federal level a peace through security campaign which we have been running throughout Australia through all the State divisions and branches of the Liberal Party of Australia. We stand second to none in our belief that there is no greater moral or political issue than the securing of a just peace. We are most anxious to be able to promote that cause and also to promote our view as to how peace can be achieved. We agree with the lesson of history that peace will never be achieved if free nations unilaterally lay down their arms in the hope that totalitarian dictatorships will do the same. We are concerned that that argument, which is challenged in so many quarters in Australia, will be resisted, will not flourish and, indeed, will be reversed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pleasing to see in this statement that the Government is committed to the same view as to how peace can be achieved. The Prime Minister dismisses those Utopians who are so eager for peace, those who trust the panaceas of international disarmament and isolationism, ignoring the unfortunate history of such policies. Certainly the Government and the Opposition, on this particular matter, have a bipartisan policy even though we may differ in other aspects of the peace issues. We do differ from the Government in the optimistic view it has of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. This is not the time or place to debate that Treaty. In fact, we will be debating it on Monday next. We agree with the Government's broad policy, particularly the need to maintain ANZUS, to maintain the Western alliance and, in other words, as we see it in the Opposition, to maintain policies to achieve security as the means of achieving peace. In our view, that has been the effective road to peace over the past 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for disarmament is also paramount in our thinking but we believe that this can only be achieved by painstaking negotiations between, particularly, the nuclear powers but assisted and encouraged by other nations in the world such as Australia. Australia is playing a part in encouraging all those developments. We see this as the means, and the only means, of achieving effective peace. Of course, those agreements must lead to verifiable and mutual reductions in armaments. We will continue to give our support to those attempts but we believe that we also must maintain an effective deterrence as a pre-condition of maintaining peace in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> We are having a very attenuated debate this morning. I presume that Senator Macklin also wishes to say a few words. This is a subject that should be debated very fully in this chamber. I hope that the Government may be able to find time next week in the last week of our sittings to have a better debate than is possible in the short time we now have at our disposal. Therefore, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Australian Democrats welcome the statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the International Year of Peace-Australia's Contribution. I was privileged three or four weeks ago to be in Assisi where there was an international day of prayer for peace at which all the major world religions and ecclesiastic communities gathered to pray that the world be at peace, that the wars that are currently raging around the world-of course, wars are always in continuous progress around the world-may cease and that the major nations around the world which are currently threatening one another with ultimate destruction may come to see that as the insanity that it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's statement rehearses a number of matters, some of which will be the subject of other legislation, as Senator Durack has already said. I do not propose at this time to canvass those. However, I draw attention to some other subjects. On page 5 of the statement the Government raised the matter of chemical weapons. This is a subject which, in fits and starts, appears on the debating table. It is an extremely important subject, probably overshadowed in many ways by the nuclear debate, but I believe that the Prime Minister quite rightly has drawn attention to the problem of chemical weapons in the world and the heinous type of weapons which are currently being prepared. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the decision by the United States of America to recommence the production of chemical weapons for any possible chemical warfare was a massive retrograde step in moving to the eventual abolition of these weapons. It seems to us that all efforts must be made in this area, that it must not be pushed aside, because of the concentration in terms of nuclear weapons, and that close attention must be paid to this matter. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Hayden) has had a personal interest in this matter and has been quite successful in a number of the operations he has been engaged in internationally in getting the attention of various nations around the world to concentrate on this. Australia should support the efforts of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this regard and I am glad that the Prime Minister has drawn attention to those efforts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to that question is no.

An example of that is the introduction of declarations of pecuniary interests by members of parliament-something which the Opposition never did and is totally opposed to. We expect that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I inform the Senate that an agreement on a ceasefire was signed yesterday between the Government of the Philippines and the National Democratic Front, representing the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People's Army. The ceasefire will take effect for 60 days from 10 December. The ceasefire agreement provides for formal discussions on substantial aspects of the peace talks to begin within 30 days.

The agreement on a ceasefire will allow negotiations towards a peaceful resolution of the insurgency problem to continue. Genuine resolution of that problem in the Philippines is still however a long term prospect. The insurgency has complex political, social and economic roots and there are a great many difficult issues to be faced by the negotiators.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The national accounts, which I think were released on Wednesday, showed that total imports of goods and services in seasonally adjusted real terms had increased by 0.7 per cent between the June and September quarters. However, that increase was the result of a surge in what the Commonwealth Statistician defines as exogenous imports, which in this case principally were civilian aircraft-a point which a close reading of the bulletin concerned made quite clear. According to the September quarter balance of payments figures, total exogenous imports in seasonally adjusted real terms increased by a massive 48.2 per cent between June and September. When those exogenous imports are adjusted out of the figures for the two quarters, we find that in fact imports in the September quarter fell by 3 1/2 per cent, in seasonally adjusted real terms, on the previous quarter. Civil aircraft imports are expected to be at an even higher level in the December quarter but there will be a reduction in aircraft imports in the second half of this financial year, falling away to almost nothing, on present expectations, in the next financial year. The figures for aircraft imports were spelt out in a supplement to the September `Treasury Round-up of Economic Statistics'. Finally, when assessing the response of imports and exports to the increased competitiveness of Australian industry, brought about by the present Government, it is necessary to adjust the raw figures for the effects of one off, or as the Statistician defines them `exogenous', items to which I have referred.</PARA></TALK.START>

With the most extraordinary logical gymnastics, Opposition senators try to draw all sorts of conclusions from that. For example, if Mick Young were fined for speeding in the Australian Capital Territory, booked by the Australian Federal Police and convicted of a speeding offence, I suppose the Opposition would suggest that he should resign because he is the Minister responsible for the Federal Police and has been booked by the Federal Police for speeding.

The decline in private health insurance was not unexpected because one of the primary objectives of Medicare was to ensure that everyone was covered for basic hospital and medical care through the income-related levy and, therefore, may not need private cover. The latest survey of insurance status by income levels shows that only 19 per cent of those with incomes below $150 a week have private health cover.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The difficulty with an opting out system is that those who opt out are the wealthy. Those who opt out are those who are fit and believe that they will not need health care. When they opt out it leaves in the system only the poor and those who are likely to have chronic ill health and a chronic need for the system. Therefore, the burden ends up on them. Once upon a time in this place there was a general acceptance of the community rating principle in health insurance. Even those who opt out under those circumstances never know when they will be in a motor vehicle accident or will have a catastrophic illness and therefore need considerable, very lengthy and very expensive medical care. For that reason a system whereby everyone contributes on the basis of his capacity to contribute with the option of taking out health insurance for extra private medical care is the best system. It is the system that has worked. Those who try to fiddle with the system, as the previous Government did on seven different occasions, and introduce such programs as opting out are condemned, as the previous Government was, to introducing health insurance amendment legislation each year implementing more and more systems each of which fails. The simple principle of a basic community rating plus the capacity to insure for those who wish and can afford to insure for private medical care is and will remain a very satisfactory method of funding health care in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I ask the question particularly considering his reply to Senator Parer and his comments on intent and entitlement to refund. I refer to the case of a taxpayer who on 21 April 1986 received a summons from the Australian Taxation Office for lodgment of his 1984-85 income tax return, for which he had gained an extension until 28 February 1986. The next day the taxpayer sent a copy of his return to the Tax Office but received no acknowledgment. However, the Tax Office could find no record of lodgment and, despite repeated offers by the taxpayer to provide other copies of his return, on 15 May 1986 the magistrates court fined him $200 plus costs and gave him seven days to make payment, otherwise 24 days in gaol. Was not the taxpayer in this actual case, who was entitled to a refund, less at fault than the Treasurer? Does not this case illustrate that there is one standard for ordinary taxpayers in this country and another for the Treasurer?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, Mr President. The question, for those who cannot remember it, concerned an alleged lodgment or posting of a return to the Taxation Office. As I understand it, when people claim to have posted a tax return, a cheque on assessment or whatever, it is normal practice for the onus of proof to rest with the taxpayer. Although there is a bit of rough justice about that, it is pretty obvious I would have thought, even to Senator Walters, that if the Commissioner were to do otherwise it would make taxpaying virtually voluntary. Anybody who was caught for not paying tax could say: `I sent the cheque last year'.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw the article in the Sydney Morning Herald referred to by Senator Giles. It caused me more concern, having regard to the fact that the overwhelming majority of the 700,000 beneficiaries that my Department caters for are old and in the vulnerable group in respect of any exploitation that may take place in the way in which drugs are made available to them based upon their eligibility. I think it would be conceded by most honourable senators that a relationship develops between patients and chemists under the prescription system. It would be a great pity if that were to be changed in such a way as to be detrimental to it. As I understand it, the overwhelming majority of pharmacists are in the small business category. Personal relationships do exist, particularly with those who are beneficiaries of my Department and who have a regular need for prescriptions to provide a certain range of drugs. Therefore, I have some serious reservations that that process and that relationship might be impeded by the suggestions from the Australian Retailers Association that the retail shops should have untrammelled entry into the pharmaceutical area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the retailing of drugs is completely different from the retailing of goods. My impression is that the operation or ownership of chemist shops implies a degree of responsibility which is very freely accepted by the pharmacist as well as the patient. If pharmacists were forced out of the area and most of the prescribing and retailing of drugs came within the jurisdiction of the major retailing outlets this relationship would break down and lead to impersonal relationships. I think there would be a drop in the quality of patient care, particularly for the vulnerable sections of our community.</PARA>
<PARA> We have to concern ourselves with the temptation for large retailers to encourage the overutilisation of drugs. That would be inappropriate in times of economic restraint as well as in the interests of the health care of the patients. Certainly, it could be said that the sale of certain drugs, especially addictive drugs, should be supervised by a qualified pharmacist and not by sales assistants. Drugs such as narcotic based pain-killers, for example, codeine, and others, ought to be constantly supervised by a properly qualified pharmacist. If this area is to be transferred from the small business sector-I personally have a philosophical commitment to that grouping-I think it would be detrimental not only to patients in my area but also to patients generally who have regular recourse to pharmacies.</PARA>
<PARA> Over time there has been a capacity to build up a patient drug treatment profile. Having been the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for 3 1/2 years, I do not recall ever receiving any complaints from veterans about their relationships with the pharmaceutical industry. I would have some grave reservations should the suggestion be taken up and implemented by the appropriate authorities to change that relationship so that the retail industry would become the prescriber and supervisor of drugs, not the pharmacists.</PARA>

<PARA> As to the final part of the question about visits to Australia, the Government has consistently taken the view that Australia has a strong moral obligation to play its full part in international efforts to bring about peaceful change in South Africa. It is the Government's belief that concern over developments in South Africa and abhorrence of apartheid are widely felt by the Australian community. In this context, it will be remembered that the Government established in 1983 a program under which prominent opponents of apartheid could visit Australia. There have been several such visits in recent years. I am pleased to be able to say, on behalf of the Foreign Minister, that an invitation has been extended to the President of the ANC to visit Australia in the first half of 1987 and that Mr Tambo has accepted that invitation.

The Government would deeply regret such a development, if it were to have taken place today. Our position remains as was described by the Prime Minister on 8 June when he indicated that he had written to President Reagan to express Australia's concern at the announced intention of the United States Administration no longer to be bound by the SALT II Treaty when determining the composition of United States strategic nuclear forces. Australia attaches great importance to compliance with the terms of the SALT II Treaty by both the United States and the Soviet Union. The Treaty's numerical limits provide an important measure of predictability as to the strategic nuclear balance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, it is embarrassing to have to admit that although this proposal for a discussion of a matter of public importance was submitted at only 12.30 this afternoon it is already out of date because the double standards of this Government have been demonstrated most recently at Question Time. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) was the latest example with his admission last night that, after all his pontificating on taxes, he had failed to lodge a tax return for something like 15 months. But today in Question Time we had the usual performance from Senator Walsh, and indeed even from Senator Button. They went from being great critics of anyone who in any way got into difficulties with the taxation system to being great defenders of the Treasurer, the leading light among those in the Government who have abused other people for their standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today is a particularly appropriate time to propose this matter because hundreds of thousands of Australians have been told by this Government, the Treasurer, Senator Walsh, Senator Button and the rest of the rag-bag lot of them that they must lodge their first fringe benefits tax returns and they must lodge with those returns the cheque for the tax which has been incurred. Anybody who has dared to suggest that there should be some delay or some failure to pay has been traduced in this Senate and accused of everything from treason on. Today is the day when very many Australians are focusing on the tax policies of this Government, and many will be focusing on the miserable performance of the present Treasurer. Thousands are being subjected to new burdens and new paperwork. Senator Button described that paperwork as horrific but it is still being applied to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate we will actually have a defence of the Treasurer by Senator Richardson. I think that says a lot about this Government's attitude to Mr Keating and to this issue of double standards. Look at the situation. Senator Button has busily cultivated a reputation for honesty. There is no way that he could come in here and debate the Government's double standards without dobbing his Government in as he has so often done from his chair opposite. What about Senator Walsh, that particular exponent of double standards? There is no way he could enter this debate without eating every word he has said at Question Time for the last year. What about Senator Gareth Evans? He is a great defence counsel; I think Senator Evans, QC, appeared in court once or twice!</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he lost. Perhaps if he came into the debate he could quote the brilliant speeches he made about ministerial responsibility when he said: `If you do not live up to the highest possible standards you should resign'. There is no way Senator Gareth Evans could participate in this debate. There is no way he could sit alongside Mr Keating if he applied the principles that he described when he was trying to bring down Liberal Ministers. I suppose Senator Susan Ryan could have spoken in the debate but, fortunately for her, she had better things to do. Senator Gietzelt's specialty is trying public servants in the Senate. He is exhausted at the end of a week of traducing Air Vice-Marshal Flemming and not leaving the matter for the processes of the law which are available to both him and Air Vice-Marshal Flemming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators opposite are a disgraceful rag-tag lot. The fact that they have the leader of the right wing faction of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party defending Mr Keating speaks for itself. It is a great pity. Perhaps Senator Richardson will tell us about his history in the New South Wales Labor Party. We could have a debate on the Enmore matter and the other sordid incidents with which he is associated. All I can say is that if the best the Labor Party can do is to produce Senator Richardson to defend the government and Mr Keating, that really is pathetic. He would certainly have wanted to receive absolution from the Pope, who is now visiting Australia, before indulging in this debate. </PARA>

I simply turn to what I think is one of the most objectionable features of this two-faced Government, and that is the way it attacks anybody who can be identified in any way with the Liberal Party of Australia, the support of the Liberal Party or indeed opposition to the Government. I need do no more than remind the Senate of Question Time on 12 November in which Ministers, not only Senator Walsh but also others, attacked Mr Clarke, Mr Ellicott, Mr Andrew Hay, Mr John Hay, the late Sir Phillip Lynch, Lady Lynch and Mr Moran. I simply say to this Government that its total hypocrisy in these matters, its capacity to single out anybody who is seen to be in opposition to it and to use this chamber to blackguard them is one of the most unpleasant developments in politics over a very long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of the frequent attacks on Mr John Elliott for saying no more than what was said by Mr Charlie Fitzgibbon. It was Mr Charlie Fitzgibbon, a trade unionist who no doubt has the respect of the people opposite, who said that there was no way that he would put his money into Australian companies. He said: `I would put whatever money I owned in fixed term investments'. We have not heard any traducing of Mr Charlie Fitzgibbon, but Mr Elliott is fair game because he dares to identify himself with the Liberal Party. We saw the traducing of the late Sir Phillip Lynch and Lady Lynch; yet what have we heard from the Government about the land dealings of Dawkins? Nothing. There is a total double standard in that matter. We heard from the Government that I was involved in tax cheating because of my membership of a law firm two weeks before the Government appointed my partner of those years, Mr Ian Temby, as Director of Public Prosecutions. That is what I mean by double standards. I, because I am a Liberal politician, am held up as a friend of tax cheats at the same time as this Government is appointing my partner of those years to be the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has the responsibility for bringing tax cheats to book. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of the treatment of Mr Temby. He was defended by the Government when it appointed him, when some people criticised his appointment because of the politics of it, and what happened? As soon as he prosecuted some Labor functionary, the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party which is best represented here by Senator Richardson, who will speak in this debate, called for his dismissal and removal. They are the standards of this Government. The standards of this Government do not exist. It traduces those who stand in its way. </PARA>

But let Senator Richardson explain the attitude of his cohorts in the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party. It was a disgusting example of the politicisation of things that should not be political in this country. Let me again draw attention to the contrast between the attitude of the Government in this place when a retired Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia was traduced over and over again, by Senator Walsh in particular, and the attempts to get a proper investigation of serious allegations relating to another High Court judge blocked, blocked, blocked until this Government was forced to appoint a commission. This Government appointed that Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry only because in the end inquiries showed that a commission was absolutely necessary. That is another example of the sort of double standards that are disgusting about this Government. Over and over again we get a traducing of a man who is now sick and old and unable to defend himself and that should be contrasted with the treatment of someone whom this Government regarded as part of its own.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They are the sorts of illogicalities and hypocrisies that are sickening. Look at the difference between the treatment of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen and Mr Burke. Day after day we hear the Queensland Government being traduced in this place, but when I raised the question about the involvement of the Western Australian Labor Government in the re-evaluation of shares in the Fremantle Gas and Coke Co. there was a total lack of interest. Note the difference-a total lack of interest on the part of the Government after weeks, months and indeed years of traducing Senator Florence Bjelke-Petersen, her husband and the Queensland Government. It is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> It not only occurs in this Senate. Look at the efforts of Mr Hayden who, in the House of Representatives last year, made an attack on Mr David Barnett. What was the basis of his attack-that David Barnett had written about the political affiliations of public servants. Mr Hayden said how disgusting it was that a journalist should criticise public servants in the Department of Foreign Affairs because of their political affiliations. He then went on to attack Mr David Barnett for his political affiliations. In this place we had another example of the Walsh syndrome-the misquoting of figures to blacken the name of a man who had once worked for the Liberal Party and who is now working as a journalist. That is what this matter of public importance is about. This Treasurer is just the latest example of double standards. We in the Opposition, who have to put up with the worst examples of that through the tongue of Senator Walsh day by day, wish to express our disgust at the lack of any standards on the part of this Government. </PARA>

I listened to Senator Chaney complaining about the chamber being used to traduce people's reputations. Yet he not only condoned but also promoted some members of his back bench doing it to me only two weeks ago. The fact that they were slaughtered in the attempt shows up just how poor they are. But when it comes to double standards, we had years of looking to Liberal governments to tell us just what they were about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is only a few weeks since the last attack on the Treasurer (Mr Keating) failed. The last attack on the Treasurer was over the matter of his travelling allowance, which Senator Chaney mentioned. But what happened when the Opposition raised this matter? All of a sudden, one by one, the old Ministers, the ones who learnt the system while they were in government, came out. First we had Ralph Hunt saying: `By the way, I do the same thing'. Then we had Sinclair saying: `I think I have done the same thing too'. If honourable senators want to check the records they should look at Tony Street. What did Senator Chaney do in all those years to stop any of this? He did absolutely nothing. Senator Chaney, the Prime Minister whom he served under and the Treasurer whom he served under all did nothing, yet the Opposition comes into this chamber and lectures us about double standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney, at the end of a parliamentary session, with the Liberal Party of Australia collapsing all around him, jumps up to grab an issue and once again plays the man. Members of the Opposition will not come in here and argue about economic policy; there is no chance of that. We had three weeks of Question Time in the Senate when all they did was question Senator Gietzelt about the Australian War Memorial. Important though that may be, I have to inform the Liberal Party that it is not the biggest national issue. It never could be. Opposition senators will not get up and debate the economy because Keating has always had the answers and they have been slapped down too easily. We now have a matter of public importance which has been born out of the miserable fear and desperation of a party going down the drain and a leader going down the drain with it. As members of the Opposition cannot match the Treasurer on the argument of principle, they have a go at his propriety. That is the standard that they have set. We on this side of the Senate do not have that sort of standard. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to go through some of the arguments that Senator Chaney raised. I might say that singularly lacking in any of them were specific criticisms of the Treasurer. He went through a litany of alleged sins of all sorts of people. Let me quote from a couple of taxation rulings which are publicly available, not secret documents. Ruling 2372 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Additional tax for late lodgment generally is not calculated where the assessment results in a credit or refund. </PARA>
<PARA>What will happen in Paul Keating's case? He will receive a refund. I think it is worth while, even for Senator Chaney, to listen to ruling 2246, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where it seems clear that a person has no residual tax liability or is due for a refund, it is desirable . . . that other efforts to obtain lodgment of returns are made (such as telephone contact with the person) before . . . action is instituted. </PARA>
<PARA>I reckon that the Liberal Party ought to look at those rulings, because they are the rulings of the Commissioner of Taxation, they are the rulings that are available to the Australian public and they are the rulings by which every citizen, from the lowest to the highest in the land, must abide. Those rulings do not indicate that Paul Keating has committed any major crime. They indicate nothing of the sort. Paul Keating regrets what he did; he said that publicly last night. He went into the House of Representatives and told the world what happened. He told it honestly and truthfully, as he always does. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look further at the pathetic performance of Senator Chaney on the question of double standards. Today we are talking about tax. The double standard of honourable senators opposite was set on tax avoidance. Do we not all remember what Frank Costigan had to say? Do we not remember him saying that, under the previous Government, tax avoidance was the only growth industry to match the heady days of the Victorian gold rush? The problem with the Liberal Government was that that was the only industry it could get to grow. It protected tax avoiders year after year. The too-hard basket in John Howard's office just piled up. The previous Government was not game to take on tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, having been exposed in all those matters, not only is not game to do anything about tax avoidance but also is not game to tell us anything that it is prepared to do. Its tax policy remains hidden-the light under the bushel. Where is the Opposition's tax policy? We have waited breathlessly for two years and we have got nothing from the Opposition. There are two reasons for that. There are no intellects in the Opposition to think one up but, in any event, there are too many divisions. The Opposition cannot sort it out. It has tried time and again to come up with any sort of tax policy and it has totally failed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the specifics of Paul Keating's situation which the Opposition has failed to go into. The Treasurer was to receive a letter dated 3 November which advised him that his income tax return was overdue and that he should lodge it. He never received that letter from the Deputy Commissioner because it was stolen from the mail and miraculously found its way to Jim Carlton. The first time the Treasurer knew that it existed was Tuesday morning when he was contacted by the Commissioner of Taxation. The Treasurer advised the Commissioner that he had prepared the return and that it would be lodged. It was lodged that day. The Treasurer is a pay as you earn taxpayer and he expects to receive a refund on that 1985 return. The Commonwealth was not being disadvantaged; Paul Keating was being disadvantaged by not having had the time to put it in. The cost of the delay in lodging the return will, therefore, be borne by the Treasurer. There is no question of the Treasurer trying to evade or avoid paying tax. That is not to say that he should not have lodged the return earlier. Of course he should have. As he has expressed it, it is a matter of regret that he did not. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in view of those rules, it is hard to get all that excited about this matter. The facts are that thousands of ordinary taxpayers get their tax returns in late. I would love to do a survey of the Opposition, the Government and the gallery to see how many people have ever been guilty of not filing a return by the right day. I think we would find that an awful lot of people would have to make that terrible admission. But how terrible is that admission? The reality is that it is a very small matter-hardly, one might say, a hanging offence. </PARA>
<PARA> What would have happened under the standards set during the years of the Fraser Government? Honourable senators should remember what happened to Minister Nixon. The previous Government set up a royal commission to inquire into him. When he was found guilty what did the previous Government do? Did it abide by the terms of the royal commission? No. Yet it lectures us on double standards. The former Prime Minister got up and bucketed the royal commissioner. That was the previous Government's only response. It was a case of protecting Nixon at any cost and that is what it did. This Government, on the other hand, has set a new standard for ministerial behaviour. We have a register of interests. Ministers and members of the back bench in the House of Representatives and, I dare say, in the Senate shortly will have to make their affairs available for public scrutiny. Government members have not objected to doing so. Our Ministers have come forward cleanly, in the light of day. But nothing that happens in the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia is ever seen in the light of day, particularly their tax policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing that Paul Keating has done reflects one iota on his integrity or his honesty. All it reflects is the fact that Paul Keating has spent hours and hours every day of the year for four years making this country a better place to live in. The fact that he got a tax return in late is just not the end of the world. The Opposition wants to lecture us about double standards but what do we see when we go through all the names? Look at what happened to Garland. Look at what happened to Lynch. Look at what happened to Sinclair. I could go on and on. But for honourable senators opposite it did not matter what was the sin of these people; it was a matter of how much influence they had as to whether they were removed. If they were in the National Party of Australia-the old tail wagging the dog-the sky was the limit. It did not matter what one did, one was safe. There was no way Malcolm would take them on-they were right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not sure how long it was but I am informed that it was 23 hours. I knew that if I blinked I would miss it. But I remember why he was removed. We all know that Malcolm Fraser had a commitment on South Africa which we share. I think it was reasonable to suppose that in all of the years he was in politics he would get something right and he did. He had my full support in removing Senator Sheil from office. However, one should look at what our Government has done in respect of standards of ministerial propriety. We have put those matters out for scrutiny. Our Ministers have passed the test every time and Paul Keating has passed it again on this occasion. Mick Young faced two inquiries and passed both. That is why Mick Young is still a Minister and why he is still a thorn in the side of the Opposition in the other place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Paul Keating, in receiving the letter from the Tax Office, has not been treated any differently from any taxpayer in this country. What we have also done is made sure that no matter which rung a person is on in this country, from the bottom to the top, people get treated fairly and equally. So Paul Keating got a letter; big deal. He got the same letter that is sent to thousands of taxpayers every year. When he got up and admitted it and regretted it that should have been the end of the matter. But it was not for the lot opposite. When they are going down the drain they will grab on to anything. If this is the best they can grab on to I have to say: `God help you; no one else will'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition demands the Treasurer's resignation. Presumably, if the Minister for Transport (Mr Peter Morris) got a parking ticket he would have to resign; that would be pretty terrible. If the Minister for Local Government and Administrative Services (Mr Uren) paid his rates late, he would have to resign; that would be pretty terrible. But that is the size of this issue. It is a trivial issue; it is nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question of financial gain for the Treasurer. There is no question of ministerial impropriety. There has been no attempt to withhold information from the Parliament. There has been no attempt to cover up. The Opposition is trying to smear the Treasurer. It has tried before and failed. It will fail in any attempt to traduce the Treasurer or anybody else. Any party that tolerates on its front bench someone like the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who is a member of the other place, has to be joking when it lectures anyone on this side about double standards. We have seen the bucket jobs he comes up with. I ask Senator Chaney to tell us how proud he is of those. Let Senator Chaney get up and defend the honourable member for O'Connor; let him tell me what a great man he is and how he is an addition to this Parliament. When it comes to double standards, they belong to the John Howards and the Senator Chaneys who put people like the honourable member for O'Connor up at the front, who encourage him, promote him and let him drop the buckets. But what happened to the honourable member for O'Connor? Like all the buckets that members of the Opposition drop-he could not hit the broadside of a barn from five paces anyway-they all missed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer goes from strength to strength. I have to say this: When it comes to the new year and we resume in February I am certain of one thing-I am certain that the Treasurer will still be the Treasurer and will still be running our economy. But I am not at all certain that John Howard or Fred Chaney will still hold the offices they hold today. </PARA>

<PARA> We were certainly well looked after by the host United Kingdom branch. I think we were too well looked after. I have to admit to being uncomfortable at our being accommodated at such extremely stylish and expensive hotels. I regret that such extravagance is judged as being necessary when members of parliament attend such conferences. However, the delegation was grateful to the United Kingdom branch for its kindness and hospitality and for providing the opportunities for one such as me, who had never visited the United Kingdom before, to experience some of what London, as one of the great cities of the world, has to offer. </PARA>
<PARA> I had not been to a CPA conference before and I found the experience stimulating. It was wonderful to meet such impressive speakers as Speaker Mutasa from Zimbabwe, Charles Kileo, a Minister from Tanzania, and Hugh Francis, a Minister from Trinidad and Tobago. They and others, including myself on behalf of Australia, were unmerciful in attacking the United Kingdom Government for its attitude to apartheid and sanctions against South Africa. Apartheid was, naturally, the central issue of concern at the conference. There was a session specifically on the issue, but it was also interwoven into most of the other debates, such as the topic `The Commonwealth-Who Cares?'. Australia's position was clearly put by me and several others of our speakers, including some representing State parliaments. A contrary view on apartheid was expressed, perhaps predictably, by the National Party of Australia member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron), who in some ways somewhat embarrassed some of us, and that resulted in quite a reaction from the rest of the delegates. Other debates and panel sessions are listed in the report. The Australian delegates maintained a high profile in all of these sessions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not a great defender of the Commonwealth as an institution, but I acknowledge that the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference was an important forum, especially for representatives of the smaller and relatively newly independent Commonwealth countries, such as those in Africa and the Pacific.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This report represents the findings of the inquiry of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into two aspects of defence equipment support. The first is the supply of spares and ammunition, and the second is the provision of technical documentation for equipment operators and maintenance personnel. The report has been presented in two volumes, the first of which is on spares and ammunition, and the second of which is on technical documentation. Because of the extended time taken to obtain certain evidence relating to technical documentation, the tabling of volume 2 has been deferred until early in the 1987 autumn sitting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inquiry uncovered some serious examples of overcharging for spare parts. In one instance the total price paid to a defence contractor was a staggering 13 times the price for apparently identical spare parts at retail shops. There have been cases where private defence contractors have marked up spare parts by as much as 600 per cent just for the certification that parts will meet specifications. Mark-ups of over 300 per cent are commonplace. The Committee considered that the size of these mark-ups warrants serious investigation. The report also reveals that of the 1 1/2 million items in the Defence Force warehouse inventory, half a million were domestic items, such as mops, brooms, frying pans and tea urns. The Committee recommended the rationalisation of Defence Force inventories by purchasing domestic items from local hardware shops as required. I seek leave to have the balance of my remarks incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The remainder of the speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry was begun in April 1986 as a follow-on investigation to the Committee's earlier Review of Defence Project Management. The Report on Defence Project Management, tabled in February 1986, noted shortcomings in the provision of initial spares and technical documentation and in equipment handover procedures in a number of major Defence projects. These findings suggested significant deficiencies in the ability of the Services to support equipment after it had been introduced into service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee sought to ascertain:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Whether current stockholdings of spares and ammunition were sufficient to support present approved levels of operations and training;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The scope for improving the supply of spares and ammunition; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The opportunities for achieving greater economy or efficiency in supply by:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) reducing inventory holding costs; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) reducing the costs of purchasing spares and ammunition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was disappointed to find that existing Defence statistics did not allow an adequate measurement of the overall impact of spares shortages on military operations and training. It was not possible also to assess the adequacy of existing spares and ammunition stocks to support the increased activity levels required to deal with the credible short-term contingencies envisaged by Defence planners. </PARA>
<PARA> Within these constraints the Committee found that stockholdings of spares were generally sufficient to support current authorised operations and training levels. However, operations and training had been restricted on occasions by spares shortages. The Committee doubted whether current stocks would be sufficient to support increased activity levels for some equipment items. </PARA>
<PARA> Stocks of ammunition on the other hand were not sufficient to meet current practices and training allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> Although all Services had experienced shortages of spares and ammunition, Navy suffered substantially greater shortages than the other services. Army had experienced the least shortages. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence of spares and ammunition shortages indicated considerable scope for improving the effectiveness of supply support. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believed that an essential first step was to develop better supply performance monitoring. It was pleased to note that the Department of Defence had recently commenced two major studies, a supply performance measurement study and a study to assess the ability of the Defence Force to meet current contingencies. However, the Committee believed these measures needed to be supplemented by specific exercises in the field to test the effectiveness of the Service's supply systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The causes of spares and ammunition shortages also had to be addressed. The Committee found that shortages of spares and ammunition were generally the result of inadequate assessments of initial requirements, problems in forecasting demand, funding restraints, the failure to apply appropriate provisioning policies and procedures and procurement and delivery delays. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the difficulties inherent in forecasting the demand for spares, the Committee found there was considerable scope for improving the accuracy of demand forecasting by better initial spares assessment procedures and better maintenance planning. </PARA>
<PARA> Shortages of funds for spares support reflect cost pressures on capital equipment budgets and Defence priorities. The Committee discussed capital cost overruns in its Report on Defence Project Management. Although the Committee did not see its role extending to questioning budget priorities, it was concerned to note that budgetary decisions on spares support had been taken on the basis of inadequate information. The Committee believed that false economies had been made in some cases as a result of the imposition of tight financial constraints. </PARA>
<PARA> Service spares provisioning policies attempt to set stockholdings at levels sufficient to cover expected consumption in the re-supply period. Shortages of stock can arise when forecasts of demand and re-supply times prove inaccurate. Random variations in demand and lead times should be covered by a supply margin. Unfortunately, the Services have not been able always to apply fully these provisioning policies because of funding constraints and the limitations of their computerised supply management systems. The Committee's assessment of the situation was complicated by the significant differences in provisioning policies and procedures among the Services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned at the very lengthy administrative lead times associated with provisioning spares and ammunition within the Defence organisation. These lead times also added to the cost of spares and ammunition to which I shall turn shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> Delivery delays by and large reflected procurement problems over which the Services had little short-term control. However, the Committee was concerned to note that the delivery performance of the Government munitions factories, which supply the Services with most of their high use ammunition, was not good. The Committee considered that the Department of Defence should take major steps to improve the quality of factory management and factory management systems generally. Also, the co-operation of the Services was required to improve the planning of factory work loads and to overcome inefficient quality assurance procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believed that the effectiveness of supply support could be improved considerably by better spares assessment procedures and maintenance planning, the introduction of improved inventory management systems and the provision of additional computer support. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding significant supply shortages, the committee found substantial opportunities for reducing the size and cost of the Services' stores inventories. </PARA>
<PARA> The Services' inventories contained high levels of inactive stocks which should be more closely monitored for possible disposal action. They also contained high levels of domestic items which would be better purchased by units themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also found that inventory holding costs could be significantly reduced. Staffing levels at stores depots could be decreased and labour productivity increased by the introduction of modern warehousing technologies. Productivity could be improved also by better computer support, particularly at Navy depots. There were substantial opportunities to reduce labour costs by substituting civilian for service personnel thereby freeing more service personnel for military tasks. There appeared to be considerable savings to be achieved by introducing single-Service managed warehousing in major urban centres. </PARA>
<PARA> The costs of procurement could be reduced also, particularly by pursuing more competitive sources of supply and by reducing administrative lead times and other costs associated with Defence purchasing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that some Defence suppliers were charging excessive prices. Unfortunately, the Services were not adequately monitoring spare parts prices, especially the prices they were paying for the assurance of conformance with specifications. Also the Services had not, until recently, given sufficient attention to identifying lower-cost commercial substitutes. Navy relied too much on prime contractors for spares support rather than purchasing directly from the actual manufacturer. </PARA>
<PARA> There was room for all Services to extend the application of economic order quantity principles. Navy's failure to apply economic order quantity principles at all was a serious shortcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> Lengthy purchasing lead times add greatly to the costs of supply support. There was considerable scope for reducing contracting lead times associated with the public tendering process. The overall costs of purchasing could be reduced by extending the use of local purchasing and improving payment arrangements for minor purchasing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Defence generally acknowledged the scope which existed for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of supply support and advised the Committee of a number of major measures it had taken in recent years to improve the performance of the three Service supply systems. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Committee believed many of these measures would improve the effectiveness and efficiency of supply support, it had serious doubts about the underlying strategy of the Department's major initiative, the Supply Systems Redevelopment Project. The Supply systems Redevelopment project aims to redevelop each of the Service supply systems on an integrated basis to improve supply management at all levels. However, the project is very ambitious and its promised benefits lie well into the future. The Committee was particularly concerned with the unsatisfactory performance of the Navy supply system and considered urgent remedial action was required. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry revealed the need for greater commonality in policies and procedures for supply support and for significant improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of the single-Service supply systems. Responsibility for overseeing these changes rests with the Defence Logistics Organisation of the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of what it considered to be the limited achievements of the Defence Logistics Organisation so far, the Committee had doubts about the ability of the Organisation to achieve the necessary changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believed there was a need to review the effectiveness of the present organisational arrangements for supply support. It believed that the effectiveness of the Defence Logistics Organisation could be improved by a closer relationship between the Organisation and the Services. </PARA>
<PARA> In all the Committee made twenty-nine recommendations aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of supply support. </PARA>
<PARA> A large number of people contributed to this Report. I would like to thank my colleagues on the Sectional Committee, the Committee's specialist advisers and the members of the Secretariat for their unstinting support. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is particularly grateful to the Department of Defence for the extensive co-operation and assistance given to us during the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> We look forward to the response to our Report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The 262nd report provides comments and recommendations by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports. The Public Service Act 1922 sub-section 25 (6) requires a department to provide its Minister with an annual report on the Department's operation for the year ended 30 June. As a result of an amendment to section 25 earlier this year, departmental annual reports are required to be in accordance with guidelines presented to the Parliament from time to time by the Prime Minister after approval by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. On 1 September 1986 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) forwarded a set of guidelines for consideration by the Committee. The proposed guidelines will replace the 1982 guidelines and reflect the Government's recent Public Service reform measures. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my speech in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The remainder of the speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Guidelines will require Departments to provide details of, amongst other things, implementation of the Financial Management Improvement Program, Staff Budgeting and Program Budgeting. Information should also be provided on matters such as activities in the field of occupational health and safety, the operation of a department's industrial democracy plan and its equal employment opportunity plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends the inclusion in the guidelines of several clauses which it believes will increase the accountability of departments and place emphasis on the performance aspects of departmental activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that in addition to giving an account of a department's administration and management, an annual report should provide an accounting to the Parliament and the public of the Department's performance. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the guidelines provide that the orientation of annual reports should be towards the performance aspects of departmental activities as well as the administrative and managerial aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> Since annual reports are a record of a department's operations, the Committee believes that users of reports should be provided with information about the reasons for any significant changes in a department's operations or procedures. For instance, an annual report should provide details about major judicial decisions and reviews of the objectives or structure of a department and also significant consumer complaints or suggestions, which have resulted in a change to the department's operations or procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure greater accountability of departments the Committee also believes that annual reports should include details about any breaches of forward obligation limits and any other breaches of the Audit Act 1901 and the Finance Regulations and Directions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same vein, the Committee believes that Parliament is entitled to know of the reasons for any significant delays to, or amendment, deferment or cancellation of, a department's programs. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the recent government administrative reforms aimed at providing departments with more responsibility and flexibility in managing resources, the Committee believes that a departmental secretary should provide and certify a financial statement which will reflect his/her financial management responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee agrees with the Department of Finance's view that financial statements provided in annual reports should do more than merely elaborate on data already provided in the financial statements prepared by the Minister for Finance under section 50 of the Audit Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the guidelines require financial statements in annual reports to provide, at least, the details specified at pages 10-11 of the report until such time as section 50 of the Audit Act is amended and the Minister for Finance determines the form of the financial statements. The Committee understands that amendments to section 50 are expected to come into operation on 1 July 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, with the concurrence of the Senate, I incorporate these pages in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> The pages read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> In the line with the devolution of greater management responsibility to departments, the Committee agrees with the Department's proposal that-</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Finance's responsibility for furnishing section 50 statements be reduced to include only aggregate information from each department; and</PARA>
<PARA> Responsibility for reporting detailed financial information be transferred to each departmental secretary who should provide audited certified financial statements in a form determined by the Minister for Finance, as part of the department's annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that paragraphs B.1 and B.2 be omitted and the following paragraphs be inserted:</PARA>
<PARA>1. An annual report should include an audited statement prepared by the department and certified by the departmental secretary. The certification should state that all departmental expenditure for the financial year has been made with due consideration to economy and in accordance with the Audit Act 1901 and the Finance Regulations and Directions. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Financial statements should be in accordance with the form determined by the Minister for Finance pursuant to section 50 of the Audit Act 1901. Where section 50 does not provide for such a determination or no such form has been determined, the financial statements should include, as a minimum, the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) details of receipts and payments of annual appropriations on a program basis and explanations of variance from budget figures;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) details of free services provided by other agencies with an estimate of the amount;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) details of individual Trust Account operations under sections 60 and 62a of the Audit Act 1901;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) a schedule of cash and investment balances;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) a statement of amounts of debtors and creditors by program;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) a schedule of amounts of prepayments;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) a schedule of capital commitments and outstanding loan balances; and</PARA>
<PARA> (h) a schedule of major capital assets operated (by class); their value and the date and method of valuation. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Financial statements should be accompanied by an explanation of significant changes from one year to the next and must be consistent with other published financial data (any material differences should be explained). Data should include current year actuals and budget estimates and actuals for at least the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA>4. Where a department undertakes operations of a commercial or quasi-commercial nature in respect of which the Minister for Finance has determined, pursuant to section 41d of the Audit Act 1901, the form in which it shall prepare financial statements for those operations, the departmental annual report should:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) incorporate financial statements in the form determined;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) provide information as to the operational performance of the undertaking (eg the operating surplus as a proportion of working capital provided, trends in turnover, etc.) including, where practicable, non-financial performance measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Committee Comment and Recommendation 14</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends the insertion of a sentence providing that the financial statements referred to in paragraph B.4 must comply with the Guidelines for the Form and Standard of Financial Statements of Commonwealth Undertakings, issued by the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA>C. STAFFING INFORMATION</PARA>
<PARA>1. Departmental annual reports should provide an overview of the staffing levels and characteristics of the department, with statistics in a sufficiently standardised form to permit comparisons with Service-wide statistical information published by the Public Service Board. Figures included in reports should be consistent with figures provided in returns of staff reported to the Public Service Board. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At 11 o'clock this morning the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) put out a Press release outlining in very brief form the future program of the textile, clothing and footwear industries. The Press release has the unfortunate title of `Revitalising Australia's Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries'. While it might be true that a number of firms will be revitalised, this plan will be the death knell for a significant number of them. For many industries this is a sad document. The new plan will come into operation on 1 March 1989. Although there are some incentives and carrots in it, there are some significant problems. The principal feature that enabled Senator Button to sell this plan to the industry, to the unions, to his back benchers and to others, I suppose was the creation of what is known as the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority. This Development Authority has the responsibility of directing the industry's development strategy and for monitoring the overall operation of the plan. A number of my questions asked during Question Time today, to which the Minister responded positively and affirmatively, concerned the adequacy of the resources that were given to that plan, and the fact that it should anticipate movements within the industry sectors. This is the linchpin and it is integral to the whole operation of the plan. Production can fall. I think it is generally recognised that the plan can work provided that this Development Authority works within the declared structure and according to the affirmations which the Minister gave today. Of course what the plan suggests will not be nearly as good as quotas, but at least it does provide a minimum floor.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is good about quotas? Tell us what is good about quotas.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are problems. In answer to the interjection I tell the Minister that the elimination of quotas must spell the demise of a number of firms. I would also like to suggest to Senator Button that, if this Authority is to work, the end point will never be achieved. I also think that the Government has to be sensitive to some of the movements, actions and consequences that could happen in what we call the sub-clauses category. For example, the shirt making industry may be devastated but the rest of the clothing industry might go along quite nicely. That is provided for within this Government plan. I believe that, should some of the serious consequences that this Authority could perceive happen, they must be acted upon quickly before there is blood on the floor and before there is a tremendous loss of employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that the Minister will respond today and tell us about some of the types of regional assistance that are going to be needed. I come from a State in which much of the textile industry is decentralised, and I think we need to know what sort of assistance there will be, what sort of retraining will be needed and in which parts of the industry money will be injected. Will it be put into allied industries or other activities, such as cleaning up rivers and so on?</PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems that the industry is facing at the moment is that there is a need for it to see the printed word. So many undertakings have been given. There is a need for the Minister to flesh out, to put some flesh on the bare bones of what he has put forward today. We have already seen evidence that the Government is sensitive in a number of areas. I will cite just one example. Woven made fabric stays under quota for seven years without any expansion. I congratulate the Minister for his concession on that. That alone will provide relief to some mills which could otherwise suffer distress. There will be certain problems, for example, with the lifting of the lightweight fabric from 1.20 grams per square metre to 1.250 grams. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole program has been sold on the basis of this Development Authority. Unfortunately some areas in some States could be devastated as a result of this plan. Undoubtedly, some firms will use this as an excuse for putting into train other longer term plans. But, at the other end, if companies cannot see any future as a result, for example, of the elimination of the quotas and these end points, they will not hang around for four or five years until perhaps those end points are reached. They will cut off their proposed investment decisions fairly quickly. They will try to save as much as they can. </PARA>
<PARA> Other people who have looked at this a bit more charitably feel that this is perhaps as good a plan as anybody could get from the Australian Labor Party. But I would like to reiterate that the end point that the industry said that it could not live with was basically 75 per cent. People must wonder why the industry has accepted a plan involving not 75 per cent but 60 per cent. But, in effect, it is not 60 per cent because at least 95 per cent of imports come from developing countries. So in the clothing area the cut-off point will be 55 per cent and in the case of furnishing 45 per cent. I believe it will cause a lot of heartache not only in capital cities but more importantly in the decentralised areas. I call upon the Government to put forward its plans in those regional areas, to tell us what these packages are, to tell us what the areas of job creation will be and provide some examples of the circumstances in which money can be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there is a problem in providing funds to those companies which will probably do very well. While I applaud the provision of regional adjustment, I also applaud the Government's decision to assist the further onprocessing of natural fibres such as wool and cotton. We understand that similar studies will be initiated for the tanning industry. Of course, that should help firms in my State such as Blundstone Pty Ltd. A number of firms will be assisted by this industry efficiency program but, again, we need to know the type of assistance that will be offered. All the Press release states is that industries' efficiency will be stimulated by intensive assistance to a limited number of firms with demonstrated high potential to lift their competitiveness to a world class level. Many of the companies are already at that level. Of course, if they are to be given further assistance, that will hardly help those that are struggling. On the other hand, it will help those companies which have a shortage of working capital to establish markets overseas. But the whole thrust of this is dependent on the value and stability of the Australian dollar. If the dollar is not stable, there is not much incentive to export. Again, that is one of the limitations of the scheme. We will just have to wait and see the reaction of individual firms to this report but I know that in a number of areas the result will cause some heartbreak and sorrow. </PARA>

I hope that we can have the debate again-this is said in all fairness-when Opposition senators have the opportunity to be better informed about the details of the Government's proposals. I do not blame Senator Watson for that. I am just saying that those details will be provided in due course and we will then be able to have a more serious debate on the issue. However, I do not think there is any point in recycling anxieties. These industries have to be restructured. They have to be made more internationally competitive. It is not true to say that industries that require an enormous level of protection and subsidy of one kind and another are economically efficient industries. That is an element which is important in the Government's planning.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is aware of four instances in which funds were either directed to Queensland as a specific purpose payment and subsequently diverted into Queensland's Consolidated Reveune Account, or were not taken up by the Queensland Government. Of the following instances, only the first relates to the former category while the other three relate to the latter category.</PARA>
<PARA>(a) Accumulation of Surplus Funds under the States and Northern Territory Grants (Rural Adjustment) Act 1976</PARA>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS) under the above Act was administered by the States and Northern Territory Rural Adjustment Authorities on behalf of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the provisions of the Act, the Commonwealth provided funds to the States through the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry for on-lending to farmers at concessional rates of interest. The States were required to repay to the Commonwealth 85 per cent of these funds over 20 years at an interest rate of 8 per cent. A three year principal repayment holiday also applied. Terms and conditions of loans to farmers were a matter for State Rural Adjustment Authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> As loans to farmers were generally for shorter periods and at higher rates of interest than the Commonwealth applied when originally making these funds available to the States, surpluses of funds were built up in advance of their due date for repayment to the Commonwealth. It was envisaged that these funds would be available to the States to be recycled for further RAS lending. However, the 1983-84 Annual Report of the Queensland Rural Reconstruction Board revealed that, of surpluses of $40m generated in this manner under RAS and its predecessor, the Rural Reconstruction Scheme (RRS), the Queensland Government had chosen to divert $10m of these funds to its Consolidated Revenue Account.</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government has indicated that it intends to divert all surplus RAS funds to the Consolidated Revenue. Following a request from me, the Minister for Primary Industry wrote to his State counterparts on 11 March 1986 seeking information on the uses to which surplus RAS/RRS funds had been put. Queensland has not responded to this letter and, accordingly, up-to-date information on the use of these funds is not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Apparently Queensland considers that the funds provided by the Commonwealth have been used in accordance with the relevant agreements and that the surpluses which have been generated under the Scheme are legitimately State funds until they are due for repayment to the Commonwealth. Although from a legal point of view this may well be the case, the clear intent of the schemes was that the assistance provided by the Commonwealth was for the benefit of rural industries, not for general States' purposes. To the extent that surpluses have not been recycled for RAS purposes, the rural sector has been denied funds for adjustment purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the new Rural Adjustment Scheme, introduced on 1 July 1985, there is little opportunity for the States to benefit from accumulated funds in the abovementioned manner.</PARA>
<PARA>(b) Sugar Industry Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> (1) and (2) In late 1983, following the termination of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) sugar stock financing facility, the Queensland Premier sought from the Commonwealth an alternative stock financing arrangement on concessional terms similar to those which had been offered by the IMF.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to this request the Commonwealth, through the then Minister for Trade who had responsibility for this matter, on 25 November 1983 put the following offer to Queensland:</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland be offered a short-term loan until 30 June 1984 of up to $700,000 to meet the difference between the lowest available commercial interest rate and the concessional IMF interest rate; and</PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the outcome of further discussions between the Commonwealth and the sugar industry about the financing of additional stocks, Cabinet would consider additional assistance to the sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government did not accept this offer and it lapsed on 30 June 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Queensland Government, in refusing the offer, sought a commitment from the Commonwealth to provide further assistance from the Budget, over and above the loan of up to $700,000 which had been offered, to cover not only the interest differential on sugar stocks originally funded by the IMF facility, but also any other stocks which had to be accumulated, until such time as the stocks were sold.</PARA>
<PARA>(c) Mortgage and Rent Relief Scheme</PARA>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The Mortgage and Rent Relief Scheme, administered by the Department of Housing and Construction, was introduced by the Commonwealth Government in March 1982. All States except Queensland agreed to join the scheme at that time. The Queensland Government refused to accept from the Federal Government $3.1m in Federal funds offered for Mortgage and Rent Relief for the financial year 1982-83.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is understood that the Queensland Government had concerns regarding the objectives of the Scheme. Negotiations between Queensland and the Commonwealth were undertaken in 1982-83. Queensland decided to join the Mortgage and Rent Relief Scheme in September 1983 and has taken up all Federal funds made available to it since that date.</PARA>
<PARA>(d) The Transfer of Nurse Education from Hospitals to Colleges of Advanced Education (CAEs)</PARA>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The program, for which the Department of Health has responsibility, involves a Commonwealth subsidy to States and Territories to assist them in meeting the cost of transferring Nurse Education from hospitals to CAEs. The transfer is being phased in by quota over the period 1985 to 1993. The subsidy includes $1500 (estimated December 1983 prices) per annum for each transferred student place within the quota, a contribution towards course development costs and payment of TEAS living allowances to all eligible students. In addition, States and Territories undertaking the transfer are eligible for funds for the retraining of qualified nurses to meet current shortages.</PARA>
<PARA> The transfer is either well under way or planned for commencement by 1988 in all States and Territories except Queensland. Queensland has been offered a quota of 450 places for 1987. At this time it has not forfeited entitlement to Commonwealth funding in 1986-87 but should the Queensland Government decide not to proceed with the transfer in 1987, it is expected that these places will be reallocated to other States.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Queensland Government is refusing to accept the terms of the Commonwealth's offer of assistance, claiming that the Commonwealth should meet the full cost of the transfer.</PARA>
