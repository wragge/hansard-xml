<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled. The petition of the undersigned res-pectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Watsonia Army Barracks contains electronic communication facilities, operated by Australian and American personnel, that gives the United States the ability to pin-point Soviet nuclear submarines, hidden in the Oceans.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. This would make it possible for U.S. killer-submarines to destroy all Soviet nuclear submarines, while the U.S. nuclear submarines launch their missiles in a `first strike' attack.</PARA>
<PARA> This makes Watsonia a potential nuclear target. A nuclear attack on Watsonia would have a disastrous effect on Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The `joint U.S.-Australian' bases in Australia endanger rather than protect us. They also add a new menace to nuclear arms race, that must be stopped.</PARA>

<PARA> The fringe benefits tax will have the most damaging impact upon schools which provide boarding accommodation for children as they are also required to provide accommodation for staff members to live in and supervise the boarders.

<TITLE>WAGE FIXING SYSTEM</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="593" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Leader of the Government in the Senate to last night's announcement about a meeting to review work practices and the appointment of the Minister himself to head a Cabinet sub-committee to investigate impediments to trade competitiveness. While welcoming the Government's partial acceptance of a number of initiatives advocated by the Opposition, including its limited attack on export controls, I ask the Minister: When will the Government address itself to the equally central issue of rigidity in the wage system which is doing so much to reduce Australia's ability to respond to its current economic difficulties? Have there yet been negotiations with the Australian Council of Trade Unions to renegotiate the accord, which clearly has been made obsolete by the economic crisis?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="593" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last part of the question is that to the best of my knowledge and information there have not yet been detailed negotiations with the ACTU about wage outcomes for calendar year 1987, but that those discussions and negotiations will take place and will be in the hands, of course, basically, of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and the Treasurer. Insofar as the question refers, first of all, to the rigidity of the wage fixing system, as alleged by Senator Chaney, I just make the point that the centralised wage fixing system has proved itself to be very flexible indeed. The fact of the matter is that, in terms of aggregate wage outcomes, in the three years of this Government there has been a 7 per cent reduction in real wages, as distinct from increases of 11 per cent, 14 per cent and 16 per cent in real wages under the Fraser Government in the last three years in which it was in office. So those figures have to be contrasted if rigidity and flexibility, as Senator Chaney referred to them, are to refer to aggregate wage outcomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would again draw attention to the fact that on each occasion on which the Government has announced negotiations with the ACTU on the wage fixing issue, those negotiations have been successful in terms of producing wage restraint in this country, which contrasts very sharply with the practice in other countries such as the United Kingdom where the real increase in wages in the last three years has been 11.5 per cent, as distinct from minus 7 per cent in Australia. So when one talks about rigidities, I think, in economic terms, one is basically concerned about aggregate wage outcomes. There are other issues, of course, involved in the question of rigidity or otherwise in the wage fixing system, but of course the Government is committed to the centralised system, as adjusted from time to time, for the time being.</PARA>
<PARA> The earlier part of the question was patronising in the extreme in the sense that it suggested that the Government had taken the Liberal Party's advice on a number of issues. We do not need to take the Liberal Party's advice on issues. In respect of just the sorts of matters to which Senator Chaney referred in his question, this Government has delivered, in contrast with the demonstrable failure of the Liberal Party when in government. I take that part of the answer no further than that.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for the early part of his answer, which was sensible, and I will ignore the latter part, which was not. I point out to the Minister that his response to my question about the rigidity of the wage system was, as he admitted, in terms of aggregate wage outcomes. I remind him of the difficulties which arise in the current wage system and which were demonstrated recently at General Motors-Holden's Ltd where a pay rise to one section of the work force had to feed through to others, which caused a great deal of industrial disputation. I remind him of the criticisms of the rigidities of the system insofar as there is a denial of any incentive for increased productivity and effort. Those criticisms were made very forcefully in a couple of papers put forward by Mr Charles Fitzgibbon. It is that area of rigidity to which my question also relates. I ask him: Is the Government addressing that serious problem in the Australian economy, which clearly goes to our ability to become more trade competitive?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to go over this fundamental issue again. If the Opposition policies enunciated by the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia, Mr Brown, were put into practice, the trade exposed sector of the economy would be greatly affected by industrial relations problems-which, under this Government, it has not been to anything like the extent that it was under the previous Government, which was in power for seven disastrous years. The fact is that these things have to be changed and results have to be achieved progressively and steadily. Results are being achieved. For example, in 1982, the last year of the previous Government, man hours lost in the iron ore industry amounted to 109,000. The figure last year was 24,000. That progress has been made in a number of industries. In the steel industry 43,000 man hours were lost under the previous Government, and 4,000 last year under this Government. That is the sort of progress which is being made and which is documented. That progress is made steadily by a process of consultation and changes in attitude-not by the sort of stuff which Neil Brown keeps talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>

That vacuum is filled by any group of nutters around the country who start off on these absurd exercises such as the Peko-Wallsend one. One thing one can say with certainty about Peko-Wallsend is that for a long time it condoned practices of which it has suddenly decided that it disapproves. The second thing one can say with certainty about Peko-Wallsend is that it made a record profit last year in spite of all of that. The third thing that one can say with certainty is that the Peko-Wallsend company will have much greater difficulties in handling its industrial relations and productivityproblems--</PARA></TALK.START>

They are the results that have been produced as distinct from the Peko-Wallsend performance.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Education. In view of the recently announced crackdown on social security fraud, will the Minister move to introduce a similar crackdown on tertiary education assistance fraud involving doctors, businessmen and other self-employed people who are able to arrange their business affairs so as to enable them successfully to claim tertiary education allowances for their dependent children? Will the Minister request her Department to document the parental occupations of all tertiary education assistance scheme recipients as a first step in closing the door on the affluent self-employed whose student dependants can often afford to drive expensive cars around campuses yet front up for government assistance which is not available to many salaried families?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="595" SPEAKER="Ryan Sen The Hon S.M." NAMEID="GD5" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="EDUCATION" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My Department carries out fairly extensive checking of claims for TEAS. All claimants have to make statutory declarations about their parents' income. There are also spot checks of those claims in co-operation with the Australian Taxation Office. My Department's capacity to check in detail every applicant for TEAS is not, of course, as great as that of the Taxation Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that, despite my Department's efforts, it appears from time to time that there are TEAS cheats. It is a very bad thing that affluent parents encourage their children to engage in that sort of activity, thus undermining the morality of our society. It is a very bad thing because it means that money that should be targeted to poorer students from poorer families-that is the intention of TEAS-is being diverted in this way. Many members of parliament, and obviously Senator Reynolds, believe that there is extensive cheating. Because of the cheating, there are difficulties in increasing the level of TEAS allowance paid and in liberalising the means test on families. We have done both those things in the recent Budget but, undoubtedly, more could be done if everyone could be confident that all TEAS payments went to those who truly justified them.</PARA>
<PARA> I am very concerned about the matters that Senator Reynolds has raised. I shall certainly discuss with my Department methods of ensuring-to the extent of our capacity to do so-that all claimants are what they claim to be. I point out that the administrative resources involved in Senator Reynolds's suggestion that every occupation should be documented, and so forth, are very great and probably beyond the present capacity of the Department. However, there is no doubt that some students claim TEAS allowances to which they are not entitled. This is a major problem and I shall be having discussions with my Department to try to overcome it as much as we can.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. I refer the Minister to recent public statements by the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation that prominent Australians should presume that their telephones are bugged. How many telephone taps were authorised for ASIO over the past year? Does this number represent the totality of prominent Australians as defined by ASIO? If not, does the Director-General's statement imply that ASIO engages in telephone interceptions outside of those authorised, or was his reference intended to imply that all this tapping is illegal? Lastly, is it Government policy that prominent Australians should have their telephones tapped? If not, what is the Government doing to overcome the situation exposed by the Director-General?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure Senator Vanstone that the Director-General of ASIO was not saying that prominent Australians should assume that their telephones are tapped by ASIO. There are, in fact, very few authorised warrants each year. I am unable to comment in any more detail than that, except to say that there is no foundation for any inference being drawn from those remarks that anyone has anything particularly to fear from our security organisation in that respect. Of course, what was being said was that the technology involved in telephone tapping is relatively easy to apply. It simply has to be assumed that the security of our telecommunications installation is such, given the nature of that technology, that no one can be completely certain that his or her conversations are immune from scrutiny from those outside government who are capable of and motivated to impose such interceptions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not those sorts of shrouds. The Auditor-General raised a number of problems relating to the cost and the timeliness of the production of these items. These included delays in delivery of free-in-aid materials; significant re-work of tooling items; emission problems causing facilities closure; delays in commissioning facilities; delays in testing assemblies; insufficient staff for cost control; inadequate testing facilities and delays in expanding test facilities; a need to re-work profiling of honeycomb and composite assemblies; and industrial relations. That is a fairly formidable list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Auditor-General concluded that GAF management and its work force will have to make the utmost effort to reduce costs per se to break even. Management also faces the challenge of securing further orders to meet the Factories' production capacity. The Auditor-General also points to the need to strengthen financial controls and to increase cost-profit consciousness.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence acknowledges that there have been major problems at GAF and that these have to be addressed. The Government has taken action to reduce overstaffing-some 350 staff have now left the Government Aircraft Factories-and this will have obvious implications for the cost of production across the range of products, including flaps and shrouds. Problems in the areas of non-destructive testing of these items have been addressed by the short term recruitment of expert staff from the United States of America. The third shift on the production of these items will commence as soon as the necessary trained staff are available. Problems in the supply of materials, which are the latest in lightweight composites, have also been addressed.</PARA>
<PARA> I am further advised by the Minister for Defence that industrial action has been a cause for concern and continues to flare up from time to time but there is a belief that the unions and the staff are now starting to realise the importance of the performance of the Factories to their long term viability and the national interest. Finally, I mention the Government's decision to turn GAF into a Government-owned company. We are confident that this will inject a greater degree of cost consciousness and commercial practice into the Factories.</PARA>

That report was presented to the Parliament. Arising out of that report I recall advising the Senate in the autumn session that the Prime Minister would be writing to all the State Premiers suggesting that a standing committee of senior State and Federal officials should be established to advise on the means by which these matters could be examined by the committee on the veterans' health and hospital areas. All the Premiers responded favourably to the Prime Minister's suggestion and standing committees have now been established in every State. Currently negotiations are being conducted very favourably at that level without any difficulties by any of the State health departments. I place on public record my appreciation of all the Premiers for agreeing to co-operate in these future negotiations about the repatriation hospitals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The repatriation hospital system will continue to operate as a separate hospital system for veterans and entitlement beneficiaries in the foreseeable future. However, as I pointed out on a previous occasion, there is a need for some flexibility having regard to the geographical location of many veterans who now live outside the main metropolitan areas of Australia. These sorts of concerns will provide veterans with the option of being accommodated in other State hospitals within their regions. These matters are being discussed by the Commonwealth-State standing committee. I give Senator Devlin an assurance that negotiations are proceeding satisfactorily. I believe that in the short and the long term it will be in the best interests of the veteran community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fears that student leaders have expressed that the $250 administration charge will be changed by us into a major tuition fee are ill-founded and can be laid to rest. The Government has made it very clear that, while we decided to proceed with this charge because of the budgetary constraints, we will not be imposing tuition fees, and that with regard to the charge itself our intention is to index it according to the consumer price index in each Budget. If we were interested in charging tuition fees, like the Opposition is, of course, we would be looking in the vicinity of $6,000 to $14,000 a year, which would represent the full cost of fees. It is interesting that Senator Walters shakes her head, because everybody in this place and certainly all students are aware of the fact that the official policy determined by the Liberal Party at what passes for its national conference is to charge the full cost. The only way in which the students' fears would be realised would be in the highly unlikely event of a Howard-led Liberal Party coming to government, and then indeed students would be charged $6,000 to $14,000 a year since that is Opposition policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government's policy is not to charge tuition fees, but simply to impose a modest administration charge. Senator Foreman will be pleased to know that I had extensive discussions with representatives of all higher education institutions in his State last Friday, as I have had with student leaders from most parts of Australia. In these discussions I pointed out that the charge will benefit the thousand students who will get new places and the institutions, which will get a net addition of about $10m, and will assist the Government to deal with the difficult economic circumstances. But the charge is not a tuition fee. It is not the Government's intention to proceed to charge a tuition fee. The only people who have such an intention are the Liberals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The future of both the sex and race discrimination Acts is well and truly assured, although there will be new institutional arrangements. The existing Human Rights Commission Act terminates under a sunset clause at the end of this year, but it is intended to implement the new legislation that was before this Parliament, albeit with an amended name. Instead of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which was to have been its name, the new body will now simply be known as the Equal Opportunity Commission. There will be some reduced staffing and some reduction in funds for the new body, reflecting a narrower range of activities than was originally proposed for it. The administration of both the race and sex discrimination Acts will, however, remain fully viable and, indeed, that will now be the primary function of the Commission. The Attorney-General has established a task force to work on the refinement of the details of the current legislative proposal and the administrative and staffing changes associated with it. That task force is presently meeting and I have no doubt that the legislation flowing from it and any further amendments to the Bill now before the Parliament will come before the Parliament quite soon.</PARA></TALK.START>

Does the Minister agree that much of the SDI research is at the forefront of developments in new technologies, for example, remote sensing, micro-electronics and new materials-research areas in which Australia has particular expertise and which could be used to help Australian primary, secondary and tertiary industries improve their technological capability? Does the Minister agree with the director of the CSIRO's Office of Space Science and Applications, who has warned that countries that refuse to participate in the SDI effort will find it difficult to gain access to these new technologies and thereby damage their international trading prospects? Does the Minister not agree that the Government is pursuing a contradictory approach to industry policy by promoting research and development, including space research on the one hand, and locking out our best scientists, and therefore industry, from the latest developments because of ideological considerations?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing that can be said about the strategic defence initiative program is that government institutions such as the CSIRO and the universities, insofar as they are funded by government, will not be participating or encouraged to participate in the program. There are two reasons for that. The first is that, in terms of international affairs, the Government regards the SDI program as somewhat provocative, creating rather than reducing tension in international dialogue. The second reason is that there are considerable doubts about the credibility of the SDI program at all. Those doubts have been expressed by the majority of United States scientists through their various organisations, and I think it is fair to say that, in most scientific communities in the United States itself, the SDI program is regarded as less than reputable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I refer to the views of Dr McCracken, from the CSIRO Office of Space Science and Applications. Dr McCracken is most diligent in the pursuit of the interests of his professional colleagues and in promoting research in a wide variety of areas. However, the view that countries that do not participate in the SDI program will somehow slip down the scale of international sophistication in scientific research and industrial development is, I think, stretching a somewhat long bow. Let me make the point that under a Liberal government this country was in that league throughout the 1960s and the 1970s. If one looks at the performance in research and development in this country during those years, one sees that it was absolutely abysmal by world standards. A lot of money was poured into research and development. That money was wasted by Liberal Party governments. It just went straight down the chute because the incentives were entirely wrong. There was no reflection on the appropriate incentives that might be provided for research and development in this country. Dr McCracken may think that our refusal to participate in the SDI program will be a backward step in terms of the economic and industrial development of this country, but I point out that that effect would be minuscule, if not non-existent, compared with the effect produced by years of neglect under conservative governments.</PARA>

<PARA> The Queensland Nationals are the only political party with a proven record of reducing taxes.</PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that for the two years from the June quarter 1984 to the June quarter 1986 the government charges index for Brisbane went up by 21.8 per cent-almost 22 per cent in just two years. The weighted average for the eight capitals was 14.8 per cent, which, as one would expect, was about in line with the consumer price index increase over the same period. In the year June 1985 to June 1986 the government charges index for Brisbane went up by 9.5 per cent against an eight capitals weighted average of 6.6 per cent, which was somewhat below the consumer price index for the same period. So, far from the Queensland Nationals being the only party with a proven record of reducing taxes, the Queensland Nationals have in fact increased government taxes at a faster rate than any other government in Australia, and over the last two years by 7 per cent more than the consumer price index. However, to return to the main theme of the advertisement, which is an attack on the Liberal Party, the following statement is made:</PARA>
<PARA> In all of Australia, there is only one party, the Queensland Nationals, that is totally committed to the abolition of all fringe benefit taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>If that were true, the Premier would be repudiating what he said at the National Tax Summit last year, which may be found on page 24 of the Hansard record of the Tax Summit. The Premier said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . fringe benefits taxed on the beneficiaries but with employers to be required to record such benefits on group certificates . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That was part of the official submission from the Queensland Government. So, if it is true that the Queensland Government is now opposed to the taxing of fringe benefits, there has been a 180-degree turn in its policy in the last 13 months. What is more extraordinary about that, of course, is that, as well as being a clear attack on the Liberal Party, it has to be an attack on the Federal National Party of Australia. Indeed, the whole tone of the advertisement suggests that there are two National parties, a Federal National Party and a Queensland National Party. The advertisement clearly suggests that the Federal National Party is no more to be trusted than John Howard. That is probably true, so there are two correct statements in it. The advertisement is typical of so much of the National Party propaganda that has recently come out of Queensland. It is a symptom of a government which is in decline.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I at the outset express my surprise at Senator Chaney's eagerness, displayed on two occasions this week, to protect the National Party Government in Brisbane from the exposure of its corruption. That is the se-cond time he has done it this week; let that be noted. I hope that the Queensland Liberal Party is noting it as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The advertisement to which Senator Jones referred appears to be funded by the taxpayers and is yet another clear misuse of public funds by the corrupt Government in Brisbane. The facts, or alleged facts, in it are either wrong, obsolete or distorted. I will go through them one by one. Firstly, the advertisement claims that Queensland is a State of high employment growth and that it has the highest employment growth rate of any State. The most recent available figures show that Western Australia has the highest rate of employment growth-that is for August 1986 over August 1985-at 4.2 per cent, as against Queensland with 3.4 per cent. If one goes back one month further and takes the July 1986 figures over July 1985, Western Australia's employment rate grew by 5.1 per cent and Queensland's by 3.8 per cent. More important are the facts conveniently left out-that Queensland in every month since September 1984 has had either the highest or the second highest rate of unemployment of any State and that at present it has an unemployment rate of 9.4 per cent, compared with 8 per cent nationally.</PARA>
<PARA> The advertisement asserts also that Queensland has a high population growth and links that to the alleged high rate of employment growth. Queensland does have a high rate of population growth, but most people are either too old or too young to be in the work force. The prime age work force-those aged between 15 and 45-had a net loss of 2,600 in population from Queensland in the most recent year for which statistics are available. The advertisement asserts also that Queensland is the low tax State. I referred to this in answer to an earlier question. Queensland over the past two years had not only a rate of increase in government charges which is 7 per cent higher than the consumer price index, but also the highest increase in government charges of any State over those two years. Alternatively, if one looks at the period from June 1984 to June 1985, the answer is the same; Queensland had a rate of increase in State charges which was higher than the CPI and the highest of any State.</PARA>
<PARA> The advertisement claims that Queensland is the right place to invest and live. The facts are that the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures on new fixed capital expenditure-that is, ABS forecasts for 1986-87 over 1985-86-forecast national growth of 26.9 per cent compared with only 2.9 per cent in Queensland, which of course represents a real decline in the new fixed capital expenditure in the State. Other things that might well have been mentioned in the advertisement, but were not, are the facts that Queensland has the lowest male average weekly earnings of any State in Australia, had the highest drop in the number of new dwelling units approved in the June quarter 1986 compared with the same quarter a year earlier, had the highest growth in bankruptcies of any State in the years 1985-86 and 1984-85, and had a below average performance in industrial disputations, job vacancies, overtime work, residential buildings completions, buildings under construction, household income, motor vehicle registrations and growth in the number of new telephone connections.</PARA>

The conditions of operation of those organisations here are that neither the representatives nor their respective officers will enjoy any status, privileges or immunities, that they will not espouse the cause of violence, that they be subject to Australian laws and that the Australian Government will provide no financial assistance to their offices or their respective representatives.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not hear Mr Turner's comments on AM this morning, nor have I been able to get a transcript of them yet. I will read them with interest later in the day. I have, however, been given an account of what Mr Turner said. The main point has already been brought out by Senator Black; that is, that Mr Turner is asserting that the Commonwealth Government is impugning the integrity of Queensland public servants by calling for a comprehensive list of loan recipients and the specific identification of those individual loans where the recommendations of the Queensland Public Service and the Rural Reconstruction Board were overturned. I cannot think, even by Queensland standards, of a more blatant example of standing truth on its head. It is not the integrity of the Queensland public servants which is being impugned; it is the integrity of the Queensland Government. That has been apparent from the very beginning. What the Commonwealth wants to know is the number of occasions on which the proper recommendations of the Queensland Public Service and the Rural Reconstruction Board, consistent with the guidelines for the granting of natural disaster relief loans, were overruled politically in order to provide slush funds to favourites of the Queensland National Party. It is the corruption of the Queensland Government which is the main issue here, not the integrity of the Queensland Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is, of course, nothing new about corruption in Queensland. What is new about this issue is that this time it involves Federal money and, therefore, the full extent of the corruption is much more likely to be flushed out than it normally is when the Queensland Government's misuse of funds is restricted to funds provided by Queensland. Further evidence, if any was needed, of the need to acquire these details from the Queensland Government was provided by a Mr Menzel, who is apparently the National Party member for Mulgrave, in a radio interview broadcast this morning, I think-I am not quite sure of that-in which the reporter, Greg Turnbull, said:</PARA>
<PARA> A National Party Backbencher told me he had approached Mr Turner hundreds of times on behalf of farmers whose loan applications had been rejected and on each occasion the bank's original decision had been overturned. Max Menzel, the member for the Babinda area, sees nothing wrong with the Minister overriding the bank for any farmer.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Menzel himself said:</PARA>
<PARA> Well, I don't believe that a bureaucrat or a bank manager in Brisbane can really understand the problems that exist out on the farm.</PARA>
<PARA>So out of Mr Menzel's mouth we have the allegation that this is not a one-off aberration-this intervention to provide a National Party lackey or apparatchik, quite improperly, with a 4 per cent loan, much of which was ultimately provided by Commonwealth taxpayers-but it is something which, according to the National Party of Queensland, has happened hundreds of times. Well, I want confirmation of whether it has happened hundreds of times, and that is what I will be seeking from the Queensland Government, with the details of those individual loans where the applications have been overruled. I might say that I am not very optimistic about getting that information in the near future because, of course, the Queensland Government will cover up its misdeeds to the greatest extent that it possibly can.</PARA>
<PARA> I return to Mr Menzel, who said that he could not see anything wrong with a politician overruling the proper processes of the administration of these loans, as long, of course, I suppose, as it was done for some good National Party member. He is not quite right about that either. As was pointed out in the Daily Sun this morning in an article by Wayne Sanderson which observed in passing that, in the end result, accountability in Queensland is a matter of chance:</PARA>
<PARA> The unexpected sting in the tail of the Behan affair for the government may be the reaction of struggling primary producers.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Publicly, rural industry leaders have expressed concern that the normal system for spreading the limited funds available around the seemingly unlimited number of farmers in desperate financial situations has been overridden. Privately, some of these leaders and individual farmers have expressed much stronger feelings against the move.</PARA>
<PARA>This draws attention to the fact, of course, that these funds are limited and have to be rationed. They should be rationed according to publicly stated guidelines, not according to the whim, caprice or worse of a particular Minister in the Queensland Government, whether acting with or without the knowledge of the Premier or upon the instructions of the Premier. The more the scandal unfolds-I will close on this note-the more contradictions and plain untruths come out of the mouths of various Queensland politicians. Initially we were told that the Premier did not know about the Behan loan and that it had not been discussed with him. That was what Mr Turner said. Then Mr Behan said that he had discussed it with the Premier. Now Mr Turner says that he may have discussed it with the Premier. Everybody seems to have had a convenient lapse of memory which has led them to contradict either what he said the day before or what some of his colleagues said either on a previous occasion or at the same time.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This document presents information in the form of program statements for those agencies which have introduced program budgeting for 1986-87. The information it contains is intended to assist Parliament in its examination of the 1986-87 Estimates for these agencies and to aid the general public in reaching a better understanding of the activities undertaken by them. </PARA>
<PARA> Program statements such as those contained in the document, setting out the objectives and costs of each activity and indicating the basis on which performance is to be assessed, represent one of the important products of program budgeting. As I announced in October 1985, the Government has adopted a phased approach in this area and I expect comparable information to be provided for the programs of most other portfolios next year as most remaining agencies introduce program budgeting for the 1987-88 budgetary processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of program budgeting represents one of the wide-ranging series of reforms instituted by this Government to make the machinery of Government more efficient, more responsive and more accountable. Other major reforms undertaken by this Government since coming to office include:</PARA>
<PARA> Introduction of a financial management improvement program which is directed at assisting Government agencies manage for results by developing the management environment, establishing appropriate standards and practices, and assisting the development of management systems;</PARA>
<PARA> the introduction of human resource or staff budgeting which has achieved a greater degree of integration of decision-making on staffing and financial resources; and</PARA>
<PARA> the consolidation of appropriations and the introduction of cash limits, which together have led to more efficient and effective resource use through increasing the flexibility departments have in the use of their administrative resources while providing greater certainty as to the total resources available. </PARA>
<PARA>The successful development of program budgeting is central to many of these developments. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is still early days, as it develops program budgeting is providing a basis for more effective program management by Commonwealth bodies, by requiring them to identify objectives and costs and regularly assess results. When fully in place it will also assist the Government's own Budget decision-making by better focusing the budgetary processes on considerations of value-for-money and provide a much improved basis for parliamentary and public scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the financial management improvement program (FMIP) which I presented to honourable senators earlier this year highlighted that the implementation of FMIP and program budgeting has already led to substantial development of management processes in agencies. Encouraging progress has been made in improving the procedures, attitudes and management information systems of agencies to highlight the results of Government activity and considerations of value-for-money from Government expenditure. While much remains to be done, as indicated in the Budget documents, progress to date has enabled the Government to receive the benefits of efficiency improvements reflected by a general saving of 0.5% in salaries and average staffing levels and 1% in administrative and operational expenses for 1986-87. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will shortly be announcing further developments in his statement concerning the rationalisation and streamlining of the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> As program budgeting is further developed in agencies the Government will have access to more relevant and accurate information on the costs and performance of its programs, thus providing an improved basis for resource allocation decisions. This is of particular significance at a time when the resources available to government are increasingly constrained and the need to obtain maximum value from the tax dollar is most acute. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the undertaking of a reader survey of the 1985-86 Budget documents, changes were made to a number of the main Statements in this year's Budget Papers to make them more relevant and useful. A number of changes were also made to Budget Paper No. 6 presenting portfolio program estimates to make the information it contains more accessible to Parliamentarians and the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Together with the information provided by the agencies concerned in their explanations of the estimates and explanatory notes, the publication of the Portfolio Program Statements 1986-87 represents another important step in improving the flow of information concerning the Government's administration. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be most interested in the report which the Finance and Government Operations Committee will be making to the Senate reviewing the experience of Estimates Committees in this area and recommending directions for the future. In its preliminary report, that Committee raised a number of very fundamental questions about the future arrangements for the Senate's committee system to enable it to take full advantage of the information provided under program budgeting. I believe that the position taken by the Finance and Government Operations Committee in its further report should have a major bearing on the role and cost-effectiveness of the Estimates committee system into the future.</PARA>

This Bill therefore seeks authority to borrow money for defence and other purposes and to enable certain other expenditures to be met from the loan fund rather than from the consolidated revenue fund. </PARA>
<PARA> I should make it clear, however, that the Bill does not authorise defence or other expenditures additional to those otherwise authorised by Parliament under annual appropriation Acts and under Acts providing for special or standing appropriations. The Bill is simply a machinery financing measure-the provisions of the Bill in fact explicitly prohibit borrowings for expenditures additional to those authorised by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Successive Governments have, for many years, introduced Legislation in the form of an annual loan Bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the loan fund to meet defence expenditures or to reimburse the consolidated revenue fund from loan fund in respect of certain non-defence expenditures. In view of the non-controversial accounting nature of the legislation, which has been acknowledged by all the major parties in the Parliament, the Bill has been drafted as standing rather than annual legislation. That is, the Bill would provide authority for the necessary financing measures for 1986-87 and subsequent financial years to the extent necessary in the light of the respective year's Budget deficits. </PARA>
<PARA> Standing loan legislation will in no way detract from Parliament's ability to debate the Budget. Nor, as I have already stated, does it impinge upon the Parliament's prerogative to authorise, and appropriate moneys for, expenditures for particular purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget Speech the Treasurer announced that the Budget deficit in prospect for 1986-87 is estimated to be some $3.5 billion. This gives rise to a prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund of around $5.1 billion-the consolidated revenue fund deficit can differ somewhat from the Budget deficit as some CRF expenditures and receipts are classified as financing transactions in the functional classification of Budget outlays and, for the purposes of the budget figuring, certain Budget outlays are met direct from either the loan fund or the trust fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Existing standing authorities enable some $2.5 billion of expenditure to be charged to loan fund in 1986-87 leaving a shortfall of some $2.6 billion for which separate funding authority is required. This Bill seeks authority to borrow moneys accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of borrowings that may be undertaken pursuant to the proposed legislation is, in the case of defence expenditure, the amount for which appropriation is sought for defence purposes in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1)-some $7.2 billion in 1986-87-and any moneys for defence purposes that may be approved in subsequent Appropriation Acts for a particular financial year. The effective limit in 1986-87 is likely to be significantly less than appropriations as defence expenditures cannot be charged to loan fund until the legislation is enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> The legal limit for borrowing for non-defence purposes is determined by the level of borrowing authority approved by the Loan Council. It is estimated that the 1986-87 limits will be sufficient to enable the financing of the Budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding, I emphasise that the Bill does not authorise expenditures in excess of those which have already been appropriated by the Parliament under Supply, Appropriation or other Acts. It does not in any way impinge upon the Parliament's prerogative to appropriate public moneys but simply provides a mechanism for financing expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>On 11 June 1986, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Durack, moved an amendment to the Copyright Amendment Bill 1986. This amendment relates to the use, by educational institutions, of broadcasts in which copyright subsists in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation or the Special Broadcasting Service. The amendment proposed that copyright in such broadcasts would not be infringed by the making of copies by educational institutions for educational purposes. During the Committee debate on the Bill, the Senate referred the amendment moved by Senator Durack to the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts for `report on the amendment and any other related issues arising out of its deliberations on or before 28 August 1986'. On 21 August 1986, the reporting date was extended by the Senate to 19 September 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee advertised the reference in mid-June 1986 and invited the public and interested government departments to make submissions. Ninety-seven submissions were received. Representatives from 12 organisations were invited to attend public hearings in Canberra on 4 and 5 August 1986. These organisations included the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Special Broadcasting Service, the Australian Copyright Council, the Australian Education Council Working Party on Copyright Law and the Audio-visual Distributors Association. The Committee also heard evidence from the Attorney-General's Department. The report which I have tabled today on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts examines the provisions of the amendment in the light of the evidence presented to the inquiry. It also addresses related issues concerning the educational use of audio-visual copyright material. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's primary task was to examine the proposed amendment relating to the educational use of ABC and SBS broadcasts. To do this effectively, it was necessary to review Australian copyright law and, in particular, the copyright law applicable to audio-visual material. The Committee found that, under existing legislation, it is extremely difficult for educational institutions to copy television programs legally, including those programs broadcast by the ABC and SBS. Sub-section 200 (2) and sub-section 10 (1) of the Copyright Act 1968 allow educational institutions to copy radio programs intended for educational purposes but do not allow audio-visual copying of educational television programs. Therefore, educational institutions must either purchase a pre-recorded copy of any program they require or obtain prior permission to copy a broadcast from both the broadcaster and all the other copyright owners in the program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recognises that the amendment moved by Senator Durack was based on the proposition that television programs are valuable teaching resources and that educational institutions in Australia should have access to these resources. The Committee recommends, however, that the Senate should not proceed with the proposed amendment to the Copyright Amendment Bill 1986. I shall comment in general term on the Committee's reasons for this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that the amendment suffers from drafting omissions and deficiencies. Evidence presented at the inquiry suggests that the words `broadcasts in which copyright subsists in the ABC or SBS' are capable of three different, yet seemingly tenable, legal interpretations. These varying interpretations are possible because the amendment does not recognise the distinction between the copyright that subsists in a broadcast itself and the underlying copyrights that are contained in a program that is broadcast. The Attorney-General's Department provided the first of these possible interpretations. The Department argued that the effect of the amendment would be to allow educational institutions to off-air copy a direct broadcast only which had within it no other copyright material. If this is the correct interpretation of the meaning of the amendment, then it would apply to very few programs broadcast by the ABC or the SBS. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABC and the SBS informed the Committee that the amendment is open to two interpretations other than that advanced by the Attorney-General's Department. Firstly, the amendment could apply to programs in which all copyright is owned by the ABC or the SBS. This interpretation seems to be the one intended by Senator Durack. The ABC and the SBS told the Committee, however, that it is unusual for their organisations to own all relevant rights in a program. They acquire a licence to broadcast only. They do not acquire the copyright in the film, scripts or music contained within the program. Even when a program is produced `in-house' by the ABC or the SBS, the broadcasters rarely own the underlying rights to the material which is included in the program. It seems, therefore, that if this interpretation of the amendment were accepted, it would apply to few educationally worthwhile programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the ABC and the SBS argued that the amendment could also be interpreted to allow schools to copy all programs broadcast by them, even though this clearly was not Senator Durack's intention when moving the amendment. The report outlines the financial and operational difficulties that the ABC and SBS might experience if the amendment applied to all programs broadcast by the ABC or the SBS. In the Committee's view, the Senate should not proceed with the amendment as it also contains several specific provisions that are ambiguous, unnecessary or unworkable. These provisions are discussed in chapter 2 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Committee considers that the Senate should not proceed with the amendment, even if these technical deficiencies could be overcome, because what is proposed addresses only a part of a much wider requirement. In the Committee's view, there is a need for a scheme which would apply to the educational copying of all television broadcasts, not only those of the ABC and the SBS. As I indicated previously, the Senate also asked the Committee to report on `any other related issues arising out of its deliberations'. I shall now comment on the Committee's findings in relation to educational use of audio-visual material. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that audio-visual copying for educational purposes involves many complex issues. Since 1981 the Attorney-General's Department has been reviewing the audio-visual copying provisions of the Copyright Act. Some of the outcomes of that review were incorporated into the Copyright Amendment Bill 1986 from which the Committee's inquiry originated. That Bill, however, did not propose legislative changes relating to educational copying despite the fact that the departmental review has been proceeding for five years. The Committee believes that this delay was caused by the complexities of the issues involved and the difficulties involved in trying to reconcile significantly different points of view held by the interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA> In chapter 3 of the report the Committee analyses the issues which attracted most comment during the inquiry and those which apparently remain unresolved by the review conducted by the Attorney-General's Department. Major issues include statutory and voluntary licensing, time-shift and retention, record-keeping and payment. In chapter 4 of the report, the Committee reviews the various solutions to the question of educational copying of audio-visual material proposed by the principal interested parties. In this chapter the Committee also reviews procedures being contemplated in the United Kingdom and a scheme being used in Quebec, Canada. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the second part of the reference, the Committee found that the intent of the amendment moved by Senator Durack could be achieved by amending present legislation. If sub-section 10 (1) was amended to extend the definition of a record to include `visual images' and if the words `cinematograph film' were added to sub-section 200 (2), educational institutions would be freely able to copy educational television programs intended for educational use. Although this approach has some attraction, the Committee considers that it does not provide the most effective solution to the problems of educational copying. The Committee considers that the copying of schools and other broadcasts should be included in a comprehensive statutory licence scheme which would apply to all television broadcasts and all television broadcasters. A statutory licence scheme would allow educational institutions access to all programs in exchange for equitable remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General's Department has proposed a statutory licence scheme which appears to be reasonably acceptable to all major interests, except the Australian Education Council Working Party on Copyright Law. The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General's Department should develop its proposal for a statutory licensing scheme for educational copying of audio-visual material to the stage where the necessary legislation may be introduced for the Parliament's consideration in the 1987 autumn sittings of the Parliament. The Committee is concerned that, although five years have passed since the review of audio-visual copyright began, the issue of educational copying remains unresolved. In the Committee's view, any further delay must be regarded as unacceptable. I am confident that when legislation relating to the educational use of audio-visual material is introduced into the Senate, the report I have tabled today will be of benefit to honourable senators when debating the legislation. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want very briefly to commend this report to the Senate and to assure honourable senators that there was great unanimity on the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts as to the views expressed in the report. It is difficult to see how the amendment moved by Senator Durack will achieve the purpose for which it was intended. In investigating the subject it was clear that there was a very difficult technical area of the law and that it obviously had already taken the Attorney-General's Department five years to proceed through the shoals of difficulties. This raises great difficulties in the area of who pays. Clearly, the property in the copyright is with the owners of the property. It was clear to members of the Committee that, somehow or other, they must in some form be reimbursed for their property. But who pays? Is it the broadcasters, the Federal Government, the State governments and/or the parents?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, negotiations in the Attorney-General's Department have already taken five years. All the people who gave evidence before the Committee praised the work of the Attorney-General's Department. Clearly, it is not a question of people in that Department dragging their feet; it has just been such a difficult area. I simply stand now to urge all those who are involved to reach a solution as soon as possible. The difficulty is that the uncertainty that surrounds this area is most unsatisfactory for all parties. After all, they are people of intelligence and good will and I think there is a wish to reach a solution. I commend the report to the Senate and I urge all parties to reach a solution so that legislation can be brought down in the autumn session. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The proposal referred to the Committee relating to the Brisbane Taxation Office is for the refurbishment of eight floors of the building, refurbishment of the lifts and the installation of fire sprinklers at an estimated cost of $7.21m at March 1986 prices. The Committee concludes that the building located at 320 Adelaide Street, Brisbane, falls short of contemporary standards for office accommodation. A number of alternatives which would rectify the standard of accommodation were examined and the refurbishment option was identified as the most effective. Disruption to work would be minimised by relocating staff whose floors are being refurbished to an adjacent building. The Committee concludes that the extent of the proposed refurbishment is both necessary and generally appears to meet Taxation Office and Commonwealth accommodation guidelines. Nevertheless, the Committee recommends that details of the layout of individual floors and the finish should be provided to the Committee prior to the commencement of work on the project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal involving the 51st Supply Battalion at Guildford, Western Australia, involves the construction of a comprehensive warehousing and headquarters facility at an estimated cost of $8.2m at April 1986 prices. Elements of the 51st Supply Battalion are presently dispersed in a number of locations in Perth. The Committee concludes that there would be advantages in terms of operational efficiency and control if the headquarters is located with the major warehouse complex and the control and purchase offices. The site at Guildford is suitable for the proposed development and provides sufficient space for expansion. The extent of the proposed work is justified. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Committee recommends that Commonwealth, State and local government authorities should hold urgent discussions aimed at ensuring that the preservation of a railway spur line easement, which could in future link the site to the State rail network, is not compromised in the light of adjacent land use development planning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Walsh indicated that he would be asking the Queensland Government to provide details of certain moneys expended under the rural reconstruction scheme. In Question Time today Senator Walsh reiterated that he would be doing just that. This action follows the extraordinary allocation of $145,000 to a National Party operative in Queensland, Mr Behan. Federal money is involved and, therefore, Senator Walsh has every right to ask for details, especially after the actions that have come to light over the last few weeks. But the Queensland Government, through Mr Turner, is upset that these questions have been asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would just like to put a little of the history of this particular matter on record. One of the central people involved is Mr Michael Behan. He is from Isisford, which is in north-west Queensland. He is an unsuccessful National Party of Australia candidate and a prominent National Party figure. From April this year he has been a National Party employee as the northern director in Queensland. In January of this year the Agricultural Bank considered that the Behans had already had a better than average deal from the bank in relation to finance for their property. In early January Mr Behan agreed to put his property on the market as a condition for receiving further funds from the Agricultural Bank. So $15,000 was advanced on the understanding that no further funds would be advanced by the bank. Later in January, despite these conditions, Mr Behan applied for a further advancement of $145,000 and $50,000 from the bank and the Rural Reconstruction Board. Only recently Mr Warburton, the Leader of the Opposition in the State Parliament in Queensland, asked of Mr Turner in a three-page question on notice:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it not correct that you directed the Agricultural Bank to approve this $145,000 loan to Mr Behan on instruction from the Premier?</PARA>
<PARA>After that question was asked, the Courier-Mail in Queensland received copies of memos leaked from the bank and board in which officials clearly indicated that the loan to Bilbah Downs, the property in question, should not be advanced. Apparently the situation went as follows: In early March Mr Dellit, the general manager of the Agricultural Bank, wrote to Mr Turner advising that the bank could not accede to the loan request because of the exceedingly high debt structure at the property. This advice followed an approach by Mr Behan to Mr Turner concerning advances. At the same time, Mr Dellit said in a memo that the Rural Reconstruction Board had informed him that Mr Behan had passed the point of no return regarding viability and that the family's equity was being eroded by interest charges at a rate in excess of $2,000 per week. The only advice that could be given to Mr Behan was that he sell the property before his equity was totally lost. This was a view shared by the finance manager of Elders, his trading bank manager at the Commonwealth Bank and the Rural Reconstruction Board. This was stated in the memo that Mr Dellit wrote. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Behan was advised on the following day that the application for a loan to reduce his Elders debt, to provide carry on expenses and to provide money to restock had been refused. Shortly after Mr Dellit wrote to the Board saying that Mr Turner had asked the previous day for the case to be reconsidered. A couple of weeks later a ministerial direction was given that the loan be approved, with the condition that the Agricultural Bank operate a priority assignment on Elders for $70,000. On the same day Mr Dellit said in a letter to the Department of Primary Industries that Mr Behan had complained to Mr Turner concerning the approval of the condition. A few days later the Minister requested the bank to withdraw its requirement for a priority lien of $70,000 and to make payment forthwith. An advance of $145,000 was approved by the bank, even though, as Mr Dellit said, its security requirements in regard to cessation of priority had not been finalised. </PARA>
<PARA> When the matter was raised this month, the Premier of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, backed Mr Turner's decision regarding what he termed a `lousy $145,000 loan'. When asked whether he had intervened on behalf of Mr Behan, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen said: `I always support people looking for support and help'. Mr Behan said he has never asked Mr Turner to intervene and his application had gone through the normal channels. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then there have been conflicting statements as to whether Mr Turner acted on his behalf, whether Mr Behan approached Mr Turner and whether Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen made approaches on behalf of Mr Behan. Some people are saying one thing and some people are saying other things. I suppose that they are matters that will have to be teased out over the next week in the Queensland Parliament. But now Mr Turner is upset that Senator Walsh has asked for details of funding that has been provided under the rural reconstruction funding scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The question that must be asked is: Why is Mr Turner upset? Why should he not make details available of the way in which Federal money has been expended? I will ask Mr Turner the question that all Queenslanders will now be asking: What does Mr Turner have to hide? Is he trying to protect more of his National Party cronies who are going in a similar way to the way in which Mr Behan is going? Is he trying to protect the Premier of Queensland, who appears to have been up to his elbows in this whole sordid affair?</PARA>
<PARA> It is well known that Mr Turner will not be in the Queensland Parliament after the forthcoming election in Queensland. Mr Turner has concluded that he will not be able to hold his seat of Warrego against the popular Australian Labor Party candidate, Gordon Harding. After this fiasco with taxpayers' money, Mr Turner's departure from the State Parliament will be the best action he will take all year. Given the corruption-ridden administration in the Queensland Government, Mr Turner's action could only be improved by a similar departure of the State minority Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. However, since the Northern Territory Government has refused to permit the Conservation Commission or its officers to participate in an Uluru Park Service, despite the fact that such an arrangement has operated successfully at Kakadu National Park since 1980, alternative arrangements have had to be made.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I do not know whether or not Conservation Commission rangers have resigned or declined to resign. This is a matter for the Conservation Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The work is acknowledged. I have no doubt a good rapport with the local Aboriginal people was reached by some Conservation Commission rangers. I am also aware of instances where no such rapport was reached and that there are Commission rangers the Aboriginal people would not want in the park. It has been the expressed desire of the Aboriginal people that there should be a joint staffing arrangement involving the Conservation Commission and ANPWS along the lines of the arrangement which has worked successfully at Kakadu for some years. However, the Northern Territory Government found this proposal unacceptable. The Conservation Commission presented an alternative proposal for management, to the Uluru-Katatjuta Board of Management. At its meeting on 22-23 April, the Board discussed the proposal and was addressed by the Director of the Conservation Commission. The Board subsequently rejected the proposal unanimously.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As it is expensive in resource usage to maintain a high state of readiness, such a state needs to be related to the time needed to be able to react to a threat. Consequently, only those force elements needed to meet short-term threats in current strategic circumstances are placed on high states of readiness. Other elements required to provide follow up forces for any initial deployment and to retain long lead time skills are kept at appropriate lower readiness levels.</PARA>
<PARA> There are six Regular Army infantry battalions. Two are currently maintained at high readiness levels as part of Army's Operational Deployment Force of a light scale brigade group and its associated logistic support group. The remaining four battalions are at lower readiness levels. In addition to the Regular Army infantry battalions, a further 16 are maintained within the Army Reserve component. These units form the nucleus of Army's expansion base.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 May 1986, Senator Elstob asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Trade, the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade, relates to Australian exports. Would the Minister agree that for some time our wine sales to Japan have been dropping considerably and that this could be due to the fact that the Japanese consumer is confused with the similarity of the names Australia and Austria? Would it be sensible for our export products to be labelled in such a way that they could be easily recognised-for example, by depicting a red kangaroo, a koala or something similar which is truly Australian-and for only goods of a high standard to be allowed to use that emblem?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In mid 1985 the Japanese wine market was disrupted by the discovery of the poisonous anti-freeze agent diethylene glycol (DEG) in some Austrian wines. The contamination issue had adverse implications for wine sales in Japan generally but the confusion which arose from unclear pronunciation of Austria on radio and TV and misspelling in newspapers further complicated the issue for Australian wine producers.</PARA>
<PARA> The confusion between Australia and Austria together with Australia's involvement in the more heavily disrupted home consumption market has delayed recovery of Australian wine sales in Japan. The Senior Trade Commissioner in Japan has been working with the Australian industry to develop by advertising and other methods a distinctive image for Australian wine.</PARA>
<PARA> The desirability of an export logo which easily identifies our wine as Australian has been considered by the Australian industry which to date has decided against the use of such a logo.</PARA>
