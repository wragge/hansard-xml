<TITLE>Foreign Military and Intelligence Facilities in Australia</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that . . .</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Watsonia Army Barracks contains electronic communication facilities, operated by Australian and American personnel, that gives the United States the abilities to pin-point Soviet nuclear submarines, hidden in the oceans.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. This would make it possible for U.S. killer-submarines to destroy all Soviet nuclear submarines, while the U.S. nuclear submarines launch their missiles in a `first strike' attack. This makes Watsonia a potential nuclear target. A nuclear attack on Watsonia would have a disastrous effect on Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The `joint U.S.-Australian' bases in Australia endanger rather than protect us. They also add a new menace to nuclear arms race, that must be stopped.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should close the `joint Australian-U.S.' electronic communication facilities in the Watsonia Army Barracks.</PARA>

<PARA> (ii) the success of many small businesses in gold mining towns also depends upon the continued profitability of gold mining and prospecting operations;</PARA>

<PARA> Whereas the Australian Bill of Rights Bill 1985:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) does not include many of the rights which are fundamental to Australian society such as the right to own property and the right not to join a trade union.</PARA>

<PARA> Whereas the fringe benefits tax will place a costly and unfair burden on independent schools.</PARA>
<PARA> The fringe benefits tax will have the most damaging impact upon schools which provide boarding accommodation for children as they are also required to provide accommodation for staff members to live in and supervise the boarders. Independent schools have limited resources and this additional impost will ultimately have to be passed onto parents, many of whom are already heavily committed to the financing of their children's education.</PARA>

<TITLE>Mr Andrew Hanley</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizen of Australia, Andrew Christopher Hanley, respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That I offer the undermentioned personal explanations in relation to certain portions of an Answer to a Question without Notice which the Minister for Vete-rans' Affairs, Senator the Honourable A. T. Gietzelt, gave on 20 August 1986 in the Senate, concerning my involvement as a member of the Defence and Ex-Ser-vices Party and also as a candidate for election to a position in the Totally and Permanently Disabled Soldiers' Association of N.S.W. (T.P.D.S.A.).</PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that the Minister's answer was given under parliamentary privilege.</PARA>
<PARA> I deny that the persons concerned with the political organisation, the Defence and Ex Services Party, are or were involved in a political coup to take over the T.P.I. Association in order to use its extensive financial resources to contest the Senate Election.</PARA>
<PARA> I point out that the Association is registered with the N.S.W. Corporate Affairs Commission as a Company limited by guarantee, is subject to the strict provisions of the Companies Code and Regulations and, in accordance with the requirements of section 280 of that Code has appointed a firm of auditors who were paid five thousand eight hundred dollars last year to safeguard the Company's funds. They are still the Company's auditors.</PARA>
<PARA> I deny that I suggested that all those who are currently senators have let their party down. I also deny that I have ever said that, as a result of the Veterans' Entitlements Act the T.P.I. pension will be reduced from $190 to $71 per week. What I stated in a printed News Release in respect of the second part of the above statement was ``But the worse aspect of the new Act is the provision which creates two categories of veterans who are disabled to the same extent-those classified as T.P.I.s who are quite properly paid $190 per week and those who will in future be paid only $71 per week (both figures to be adjusted to the c.p.i.).'' That statement is absolutely correct.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to the Minister's statement that I should be the last person to concern himself with veterans' pensions, as I am in receipt of a substantial pension from the Commonwealth Public Service, of which I was a senior member, and retired on 50 per cent of my salary, I respectfully point out that I paid contributions into the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund for more than forty-two years before receiving my entitlements from that fund. Those entitlements now preclude me from receiving the Service pension. I also respond by stating that it was my concern for disabled veterans who are financially worse off than myself that I formed the Defence and Ex-Services Party, and the overwhelming support particularly from veterans and war widows suggests that my concern is justified.</PARA>
<PARA> I emphatically deny that I perpetrated lies anywhere, including in the T.P.I. election campaign and submit that there is no evidence whatsoever to substantiate such an allegation.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioner humbly prays that the members of the Senate note my personal explanation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In making that remark, I was trying to deal with some concern which exists in manufacturing circles that, if the dollar were to appreciate significantly in the next two or three years, then investment plans they have, predicated on a 62c dollar, would be affected detrimentally. I was not in any sense attempting to debate the value of the dollar as at today's level. I was concerned to make the point that in my view it is unlikely to appreciate to that extent. There are very sound reasons for saying that, I suspect, and ones which I think would be shared in this chamber and in the community at large. That is all I was saying. I made three comments together to the manufacturers. One was about the longer term value of the dollar and the second was about wage outcomes. I do not remember what the third was, but it was in the same genre as the other two. Basically, the other two factors related to inflation performance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and follows on from a question asked yesterday by Senator Sibraa relating to the administration of the Australian War Memorial. The Minister was asked to comment on the sources of information on which he relied in coming to his assessment that an investigation into aspects of the Australian War Memorial's administration was required and whether the Returned Services League was involved. I ask again whether the Minister has any information regarding the RSL's involvement in the affair.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="694" SPEAKER="Gietzelt Sen The Hon A.T." NAMEID="RG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="VETERANS' AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure the Senate will recall that representations were made to the Prime Minister for changed ministerial arrangements with respect to the Australian War Memorial following the 1984 election. The Australian War Memorial was transferred to my portfolio. It was not until later, in 1985, that an article appeared in the Canberra Times suggesting that the Returned Services League had set up a watchdog committee to oversee the Australian War Memorial in its function to perpetuate a memorial to those who had fallen in past wars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier this year I received correspondence from a group of eminent persons asking me to meet with them to discuss some of the concerns they had about the Australian War Memorial. Early in May I met a group of persons, which included eminent people such as Mr Gullett, a former member of the Liberal Party of Australia and member of parliament, Sir William Dargie, a well known Australian, Mr Alec Hill, a distinguished soldier, historian and lecturer, and Brigadier Hammond, who put certain proposals to me about overseeing the work of the Australian War Memorial.</PARA>
<PARA> When the article first appeared last year in the Canberra Times stating that such a group had been established, I was informed that the people involved were `dissidents', `malcontents' and other such descriptive words. It was with some trepidation that I met those people because I had been led to believe that they had nothing to contribute to the efficient management of the Australian War Memorial. I was pleasantly surprised to find, during my discussions with them, that they were an eminent group of men who were concerned about the functions of the Australian War Memorial. They put to me certain proposals which I found quite acceptable-that is, that they were prepared to act as an advisory group, that they did not want in any way to take away from the proper functions of the Council of the Australian War Memorial and that they were prepared to act in a co-operative way with the Council in the management of the War Memorial. It follows from that experience and from the experience to which I referred yesterday in response to another question, and from what I said in other places, that the combination of my concerns prompted me to raise matters with the Council of the Australian War Memorial. It is clear that there is some public concern, as there is now Government concern, about the functions of the Australian War Memorial. I found in this case that this group of men could contribute towards the effective functioning of the War Memorial. I hope that, in due course, the Council will be prepared to consider whether such persons should participate in an advisory capacity so that the proper functions of the War Memorial are carried out.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. Is there any justification for the claim that Family Court of Australia judges favour either men or women in their decisions? Is the Attorney-General aware that it is commonly said of the Court's decisions that `women get the custody, men get the property'? What is the Attorney-General's view of the recently released television advertising campaign by a group calling itself Fathers against Discrimination in Child Care, originating in Queensland, which claims that the Family Court tends to favour women in custody and access matters? Does the Minister accept the content of the group's advertisements which portray women as very insufficient parents? Can he advise the Senate that the advertisements will not contribute to any further or reverse bias?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="695" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised by the Attorney-General that it is simply not true to say that Family Court decisions on children and financial proceedings tend to favour in any systematic way either men or women. There is no basis, of course, in the Family Law Act itself for decisions to be made in favour of litigants on the ground of their sex. In children disputes, section 64 (1) (a) of the Family Law Act provides that the Family Court shall regard the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In financial disputes, the Family Court has a discretion to alter interests of a spouse in property, but must take into account a range of matters relating to contributions by each spouse to property, the welfare of the family, and the future need of each spouse. The Attorney- General is not aware of any common view that women get custody and men get property or any basis for such a view. Family Court studies have found that some 31 per cent of custody orders-that is, a final decision in a defended hearing by a judge-place all children in the custody of the father, in comparison with fathers obtaining custody of all children in only 18 per cent of cases which are settled by consent. In other words, we get a higher proportion of child custody awarded to the father where the court is making a decision than we do in cases where it is by consent.</PARA>
<PARA> The Institute of Family Studies study called `The Economic Consequences of Marriages Breakdown in Australia' found that the custodial parent received a greater share of property and the parent who remains in the matrimonial home tends to receive a greater share than the parent who leaves. They are perhaps unsurprising conclusions, but there you are.</PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General is aware of the television campaign commenced by Fathers against Discrimination in Child Care or FADIC, which is a rather unfortunate acronym. It is understood to be an overt attempt to suggest to the community at large that men have at least equal capacity with women to care for children. Media reports have suggested that the target of the campaign is the Family Court. The Family Court is not mentioned in any of the television advertisements shown to date.</PARA>
<PARA> A final comment is simply this: It is unfortunate that the television campaign denigrates women as care givers. The point that men can be good care givers could be made in a less negative way, particularly given the $150,000 that seems to have been raised by FADIC to run this campaign.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate will be aware that there has been a long-standing conflict of opinion between the Queensland National Party Government and the Commonwealth Government, whether it be the previous Government or this Government. Of course, every time there are any obvious deficiencies in the administration of Queensland, Canberra bashing or other sorts of scare tactics are resorted to. Senator Colston raised the suggestion that a toll road approach might be adopted by the Queensland Government because of an insufficiency of funds in respect of road construction in Queensland. I am sure honourable senators appreciate that this Government during its term has vastly increased the amount of money available for road construction, as indeed did the previous Government, on a national basis which involves all of the States. Queensland has been no exception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having had my attention drawn to the article, I find it difficult to believe that Mr Hinze would suggest that too much money has been spent on the Bruce Highway in Queensland. Everybody in Queensland recognises the importance of that important road link. Queenslanders should be aware that the Commonwealth is currently contributing 60 per cent of the total funds spent on road construction in Queensland. That represents an above average contribution by the Commonwealth to such road construction. So if there are deficiencies in road construction, the fault lies not with the Commonwealth Government but rather with either the maladministration or insufficient administration of funding by the Queensland Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we would like to see more and more money spent on roads throughout Australia. That is where we part ways with those who advocate that there should be cutbacks in public sector spending. The proper development of a country requires that sufficient road construction take place. Transport is a very important element in an efficient society. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that the Commonwealth is in any way to blame for deficiencies in road construction in Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last part of the question is obviously a matter for the Treasurer to determine, and no doubt he will do so. Senator Messner referred to a joint submission which has been described in the Press as a joint submission from Western Australian employees-that is, the Trades and Labour Council-the Western Australian Government and Western Australian employers. But I understand that that is not correct in that the submission has been explicitly dis- owned by the Trades and Labour Council of Western Australia. I just wanted to get that fact straight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find the submission annoying but not at all surprising. I remember very clearly that three years ago, in 1983, Ministers in that same Government in Western Australia went in to bat for tax evaders by vigorously opposing the prescribed payments system and forecasting the same sort of economic doom and gloom pursuant to its application as is being forecast now.</PARA>
<PARA> The real reason for the opposition to the prescribed payments system in 1983 was that groups, particularly in the building and transport industries, had become accustomed to evading income tax and they resented any attempt by a government to prevent their continuing to evade income tax. Exactly the same motive lies behind the present submission which is being supported-as I have said, I find this annoying but not surprising-by some members of the Western Australian Government. However, annoying though it may be that some members of the Western Australian Government are suckers for sob stories from habitual tax evaders who want to continue their tax evading habits--</PARA>

All the world should know by now that the Liberal Party in Western Australia was riddled with people who not only were sympathetic to tax evasion but also were up to their ears in tax evasion. That is evidenced by the fact that, among other things, half the members of the Liberal Party finance committee in the early 1980s were ultimately shown, following the publication of the McCabe-Lafranchi report, to have been directly involved in sinking companies to the bottom of the harbour to evade taxation. So, annoying though this high profile campaign of sympathy for tax evaders which is being orchestrated by the present Western Australian Government might be, that Government is infinitely better than any alternative government would be.</PARA></TALK.START>

Therefore, with that fairly important caveat, it does appear to me that the Premier is saying that he will refuse to supply the information which has been sought by the Commonwealth, or, I suppose more directly, by me. The information I sought is a comprehensive list of loans made over the last three years which are sourced partly or entirely from natural disaster relief funds, and for the identification within that list of the individual loans on which the recommendations of the Rural Reconstruction Board and/or the Agricultural Bank of Queensland have been overturned by the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

According to Mr Behan he had spoken to the Premier about it. A little bit later, according to Mr Turner, the Premier might have spoken to Mr Behan about it. According to Mr Behan, at no stage had he given any undertaking that the property would be sold, whereas according to Mr Turner such an undertaking or understanding had been given. A little bit later down the track, Mr Menzel, the member for Mulgrave, was reported as saying that he had had hundreds of recommendations from the Rural Reconstruction Board overturned by the Minister-and he identified the Minister as Mr Turner-whereas Mr Turner claimed that this was the only occasion on which he had overturned a recommendation of the Rural Reconstruction Board. So it is clear that not everybody in Queensland is telling the truth about this matter and the Commonwealth has a clear obligation to establish who is telling the truth and who is not. The supply of that list, as requested, will clear up most of, if not all, those contradictions and will allow the Commonwealth to determine who has and who has not been telling the truth.</PARA>
<PARA> The last part of the question, I think, asked what action I will take if the Queensland Government refuses to supply the list. Having said that it is extremely difficult to determine from the transcript of the Ransley interview what the Premier was saying, I intend to wait, for a couple of weeks anyway, to see whether the Queensland Government supplies the information as requested. If the Government refuses to supply that information, I think it is a matter which will have to be further considered by the Commonwealth Government. There are two possible courses of action which are apparent to me at this stage, the first being that, prior to any further natural disaster relief arrangements funds being made available to Queensland, the Commonwealth could require, as a condition of making funds available, that the background information to individual loans and the recommendations of the Rural Reconstruction Board and so on be supplied to the Commonwealth. I think the facts on the record already amply justify that course of action. The Commonwealth Government, and I in particular as Minister for Finance in that Government, has a responsibility to the taxpayers of Australia to ensure that taxpayers' money is not misused in the way that it evidently has been misused in Queensland. The other and much more draconian measure which I would be reluctant to re- commend to the Cabinet is that funding for Queensland be terminated forthwith unless the complete information from past loans has been provided.</PARA>

Will the Minister agree that tobacco is now clearly, on the evidence, the major killer among the drugs of abuse in Australia and, for that matter, the world? In that light, has the Government considered World Health Organisation statements last week which assess passive inhalation of cigarette smoke as a major and increasing health hazard? Will the Government now legislate for an absolute prohibition of smoking in passenger aircraft, since the present division of the smoking and non-smoking areas does not protect the non-smoker? Will the Government immediately begin assessing other areas of public risk from tobacco smoke with the aim of prohibiting smoking in such areas as soon as possible?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a convert in this area. We have to watch out for converts. The Government is aware of the World Health Organisation statements last week on passive smoking and its evil effects. In June this year the National Health and Medical Research Council endorsed the WHO statement and released a report called `Effects of passive smoking', which recommended that certain policies be adopted by the States and Territories to protect the health of non-smokers. In most cases the responsibility lies with the State or Territorial governments. The responsibility for banning smoking in aircraft rests with the Minister for Aviation. It is my understanding that the Minister for Health has approached the Minister for Aviation. This would not be an unusual set of circumstances. In many European airlines smoking is banned on flights of less than one hour's duration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier this year Mr Morris, the Minister for Aviation, called upon domestic airlines voluntarily to introduce non-smoking flights, but the Government has no intention at the moment of legislating in this area. Senator Button and Senator Elstob will undoubtedly be grateful for that. Action is being taken within the Australian Public Service, where the Government has responsibility and where new guidelines on smoking in the work place have been introduced with the intention of eventually making the work place smoke free.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have avoided getting into the controversy surrounding the actions of Bassendean City Council because I had hoped that this matter could have been settled amicably by arrangements in the way that all other similar difficulties have been settled in Australia in the past. It is not uncommon when group homes for intellectually disabled people are going to be established for neighbours to get agitated and sometimes protest about the establishment of such a home. However, in every case that I know of, by talking together, by consultation between the group setting up the home and people in the neighbourhood, the matter has been settled. In the cases I am personally involved with, those neighbours who were worried and did protest became active supporters and are very supportive of group homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the case of Bassendean that, unfortunately, has not happened. As Senator Zakharov said, last night the Council announced that it would evict five intellectually disabled children from one home and that it intends to proceed similarly in relation to another. This is most unfortunate, and I understand that the State Minister for the Environment in Western Australia, Mr Pearce, has had some fairly harsh things to say today about it, particularly as the State Government was intending, and still intends, to amend legislation in the Western Australian Parliament to bring the group home completely within the law. There have been some difficulties about the establishment of the home.</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there seems to be an element on the Bassendean Council which is very opposed to this sort of enlightened step which has been taken by the Slow Learning Children's Group of Western Australia (Inc.), which is attempting to get children such as these out of large institutions and into group homes and a more normal atmosphere. For instance, one of the councillors who claims some expertise in the area has suggested that the Government should find more pleasant, 100-hectare blocks to house all intellectually handicapped people, apparently out of sight and sound of the rest of the community. Someone has convinced the Mayor that Bassendean is in danger of becoming the dumping ground for institutions of this type. He has said that 50 per cent of intellectually disabled people in Western Australia are in Bassendean. This is, of course, nonsense. Group homes and people with this form of disability are spread throughout the community.</PARA>
<PARA> I still have some hope that sanity will prevail, particularly in light of the fact that all the petitions that have been collected in the area have shown that some thousands of people are in favour of the establishment of these homes and that only 22 people have been willing to sign a petition against them. However, I suppose we will always have centres of resistance of this type. It is a pity, in particular, because it is not only the people with intellectual disability but also the community itself who gain from the establishment of such homes. The community becomes more tolerant and more knowledgeable about the sorts of difficulties facing the parents and children in such circumstances, and we all benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I am still hopeful that it will be settled sensibly. It is a pity that it has gone on in the way it has in the Press in Western Australia. It is a pity that the Council has been so stubborn about this, but I dare say that one way or another it will be settled. I just hope it is settled amicably and that the situation will not arise in which the Western Australian Government will have to overcome this difficulty by punitive legislation. The Commonwealth does not intend to do anything directly. Suggestions have been made in the Western Australian Press that we should withdraw Commonwealth funds from Bassendean, and this sort of thing. I do not believe the good citizens of Bassendean should be penalised because of the idiocy of their Council. I think the best thing to do is to change the Council as soon as possible.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that this is the fourth question that has been asked today about the exchange rate. I was reluctant until now to come to this conclusion but it is now perfectly clear that this is an orchestrated campaign by the Opposition to try to touch off a run on the dollar. In other words, members of the Opposition are doing exactly what their lamented former leader did in February 1983 when he was forecasting that, if Labor got into government, there would be a major devaluation of the dollar. That became a self-fulfilling prophecy. The Opposition hopes that, by asking these puerile questions, it will be able to set off a run on the dollar again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I realise that it must be extremely frustrating to the Opposition, given its incompetent leadership and its lacklustre front bench, to see that the Budget strategy is working and that the dollar has stabilised in the low 60s-that is, compared with the United States dollar-exactly where the Budget forecast it would stabilise. It is extremely frustrating because members of the Opposition are fundamentally economic saboteurs.</PARA>
<PARA> There is the example of Mr Lightfoot, a member of the Legislative Assembly in Western Australia, who wrote to George Shultz saying: `Please keep subsidising the exports of American agricultural products to the Soviet Union. Please keep paying for the Afghanistan war by subsidising the export of United States farm products to the Soviet Union because that will impose even greater hardship on Australian farmers, undermine our current account and, I hope, lead to the demise of the present Federal Government in Australia'. In other words, these people will stop at nothing to satisfy their power lust. Lacking in talent, they have nothing but power lust. There is nothing they will not do if they think it will help to satisfy that. I note, in an aside, that the undistinguished member for Murchison-Eyre, Mr Lightfoot, looks as though he is facing prosecution for starving 300 sheep at Wanneroo.</PARA>
<PARA> I would have expected a former Treasury officer, as Senator Short is, to understand the difference between attempting to defend an exchange rate which is basically indefensible and which is grossly misaligned with market realities-the circumstances to which the Treasurer referred in Hobart-and intervention in the market-place in a smoothing way to eliminate unjustifiable fluctuations on a daily or weekly basis. Intervening to eliminate such fluctuations is a completely different exercise from attempting to hold an exchange rate level which is fundamentally indefensible, particularly if there is anything but the old fixed exchange rate system.</PARA>

Prior to the floating of the dollar in 1983, we had a modification of the fixed exchange rate system, which was commonly known as the crawling peg. Eventually, that became unworkable as well. To compensate for the fact that the Liberal-National Party Government was bereft of any workable wages policy-the Opposition still is-John Howard, the Treasurer, deliberately maintained an overvalued dollar during the late 1970s and early 1980s in an attempt to control inflation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We certainly welcome Senator Hill's statement made in New York supporting sanctions and expressing the opinion that the Western world is coming to the view that economic pressure on South Africa can have the effect of influencing change and should be tried. The pity of it is that that does not at the moment reflect, of course, the Opposition view-only the view, so far anyway, of Senator Hill as chairman of the Opposition's foreign affairs committee. The stating of that view and the clear-headed and frank way in which it was expressed by Senator Hill really do amount to a devastating indictment of the moral and intellectual shambles into which Opposition policy on South Africa has fallen. It is a clear expression of how hopelessly out of date with contemporary currents in world opinion that official Opposition policy now is. The pity of it is that it seems to be the case that Senator Hill has, only after great struggle, arrived at a view which the Government, of course, reached a great time ago and that we have been pointing the way to with other countries since August last year with our participation in the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and other relevant international forums.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should also be said that as much as I admire the courageous stance that Senator Hill has taken, it does display all those familiar traits of me-tooism which has been so often the only alternative to total vacuity in the Opposition's foreign policy. I am referring, of course, to the fact that it is only with the assistance of the very strong congressional groundswell in the United States of America behind the sanctions policy in the form of current legislation that Senator Hill has felt able to reach the conclusions that he has, and his statement is very much reinforced by the views he has found expressed in the United States by Senator Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. It should be noted, of course, that the ideas expressed by Senator Lugar and senior US congressmen are absolutely identical with the views that have been expressed for so long by this Government on this policy and in particular, and very succinctly, by Mr Hayden when he said that our aim is to bring South Africa not to its knees but to its senses. That is the essence of our policy and that is, I am delighted to see, the opinion that is now gaining ground in such a significant quarter within the Opposition parties.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude simply by saying this: I think it would be of the greatest benefit to Australia if we could arrange for the Opposition as a whole to take a long trip in search of the enlightenment now found by Senator Hill so that our debates on foreign policy in the future in relation to South Africa and elsewhere could reflect, as Senator Hill's contribution now does, some knowledge of the real world instead of the infantile obsession with great and powerful friends and the infatuation with the macho posturings and, all too often, racist posturings of the hard Right-the New Right-which are the current characteristics of Opposition foreign policy.</PARA>

We did some close analysis of the available information about the respective and comparative prospectivity of the areas of the existing national park and that of stage 3 and we formed the view, which I have articulated often enough publicly in the last week, that while the existing national park was very highly prospective for uranium-a commodity we are not in the business of further developing for familiar reasons-it is not at all highly prospective for gold, platinum and the other minerals that would give rise to a difficult policy dilemma for this Government, anxious as it is to maximise on export returns but at the same time not to wreak any devastation on a beautiful and important part of our natural and cultural heritage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Technology Information Branch of the Australian Patent Office was established in March 1984. One of its functions was to test whether information derivable from world-wide patent documentation could be made more accessible and more useful to industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Since then, the Technology Information Branch has succeeded in demonstrating a number of ways in which patent information can be used more effectively and that a demand exists in industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Property Advisory Committee (IPAC), in its report ``patent information for smaller Australian enterprises'', suggested that patent information would be more useful to Australian industry-particularly to smaller enterprises-if it were packaged with other information (legal, commercial and financial) and available from central points such as multiplier agencies or government-operated development centres.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe this suggestion to be sensible and, in view of the necessity of reducing Commonwealth expenditure, the Government decided that the Technology Information Function of the Australian Patent Office would cease. Income derived from that function last financial year was of the order of $62,000.</PARA>
<PARA> As IPAC recognised, the basic information is already publicly available, either on-line from various data-bases or from the Patent Office, although some expertise is needed to make full use of it. The Patent Office will, of course, continue to make its collection of patent documents available to the public.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the office will no longer perform searches on behalf of clients, the decision to abolish the function does not mean that information useful to industry is no longer available. A number of sources, such as patent attorneys, libraries and private information brokers, provide information, process and interpret it to one degree or another, and will no doubt continue to do this.</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed IPAC's suggestion and the government's decision may bring new sources into the field.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Treasury policy in relation to de facto relationships extends only to matters necessary for the administration of the Department. In that context, the policy is consistent with the guidelines issued by the Public Service Board. The Australian Taxation Office, which is responsible to the Commissioner of Taxation, administers the taxation law.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Income Tax Assessment Act treats de facto relationships on the same basis as legal marriages in determining entitlement to certain income tax rebates and the amount of Medicare levy payable.</PARA>
<PARA> In the 1984-85 Budget the Government announced its decision to extend entitlement to the dependant spouse rebate to include people living in de facto relationships. The concessional rebate provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act were amended to give effect to this decision.</PARA>
<PARA> Recognition of the de facto relationship for the purposes of the spouse rebate flowed through to the other dependants rebates, eg the rebate for dependent parents, the concessional expenditure rebate (replaced from 1 July 1985 by the medical expenses rebate) and the zone and overseas forces rebate. In addition, more recent income tax rebates which take account of a spouse, such as the pensioner and beneficiary rebates, also recognise a de facto relationship.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the changes so far made to the Income Tax Assessment Act to treat de facto relationships on the same basis as legal ones, the Act is being reviewed to ensure it complies with the Sex Discrimination Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The rate of tax payable in respect of payments made to Aboriginals and Aboriginal groups and bodies in respect of mining and exploration activities on Aboriginal land on or after 1 November 1982 is 6 per cent. As set out in the Taxation Laws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 1986 introduced on 19 August 1986, the proposed rate of tax to apply to payments made on or after 1 December 1986 is to be reduced from 6.0 to 5.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The tax is collected by the withholding tax system with the mining company or person making the payment being responsible for deducting an amount equal to the tax and forwarding that amount to the Commissioner of Taxation. The withholding tax is a final tax on the mining payments which do not attract further income tax liability in the hands of Aboriginal recipients.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Mining withholding tax collections, including collections in respect of royalty payments which are not distinguishable from collections in respect of other payments, totalled $1,216,958 in 1984/85.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Payments for permission to mine or develop Aboriginal land are ``mining payments'' for income tax purposes. The payments made to Aboriginal Land Councils are subject to tax as stated in (2) above.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) As part of the application assessment process CEP Secretariats in all States/Territories ensure that project applications involving Government schools are forwarded for comment to the appropriate State/Territory Department before being considered by the CEP Consultative Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) These questions are unable to be answered as complete and accurate information is not currently available from the CEP Management Information System on workers' compensation costs and manual extraction of the information would involve the examination of some 19,500 approved project applications.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) and (6) Variations to projects are approved by both the Commonwealth and State/Territory Governments and are entered in the CEP Management Information System. They are not however categorised according to the reason for the variation or the type of project affected.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) It is usual practice for CEP sponsors to deal with workers' compensation claims directly through their insurers.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The NAES forms part of the Commonwealth element of the CEP and as such, far from being a separate entity, it in fact forms an integral part of the CEP. Any differences in project assessment procedures and funding arrangements derive from the fact that NAES is a scheme of national significance, rather than one based in individual States.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) See answer to Part (8).</PARA>
<PARA> (10) No, CEP participants under NAES are employed under whatever award is deemed appropriate by the local authority.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) and (12) In States and Territories, other than South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, workers' compensation insurance coverage has been provided by individual local authorities. In Western Australia and Tasmania all CEP participants on local government projects, including NAES projects, are insured under `blanket' policies. In South Australia, CEP participants under the State/Territory element are insured under a `blanket' cover but NAES projects, as part of the Commonwealth element, were precluded from coverage under this arrangement. The only insurer prepared to offer unlimited common law cover was the State Government Insurance Commission under a separately written policy. The three NAES projects affected were:</PARA>
<PARA> City of West Torrens: Torrens Linear Park Development.</PARA>
<PARA> City of Henley &amp; Grange: Torrens Linear Park Development.</PARA>
<PARA> City of Enfield: River Torrens Pitman Park Development.</PARA>
<PARA> The total cost of workers' compensation insurance premiums for the three projects was $362,242. The premium was based on a rate of 39.4% of labour costs plus 8.75% stamp duty.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the specific policy negotiated between the Commonwealth and the State Government Insurance Commission for the three NAES projects a claims experience discount clause was included. The clause read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ``It is hereby agreed and declared that in the event of claims occurring within the Period of Insurance being less than 75% of the premium payable for the Period of Insurance, the Commission shall refund to the Insured 50% of the difference between such claims and 75% of the premium payable. Provided always that:</PARA>
<PARA> An interim premium of sixty per cent shall be determined not less than 12 months after the effective date of cover and the final entitlement shall be determined not less than 24 months after the effective date of cover.''</PARA>
<PARA> The three NAES projects in South Australia have now been completed and an initial claims experience bonus entitlement of $37,812 has already been received by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> It is understood that a further final claims experience bonus entitlement of $25,208 will be received in the 1986-87 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> As at 16 June 1986 the total value of NAES related claims awaiting determination by the State Government Insurance Commission was $118,405. The number of individuals these claims represent is not known.</PARA>
