What action is being taken by the Government in this grave industrial crisis, which threatens to cripple the entire economy of Australia? </para>

                        <para>- I understand that it is correct that three Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited mines in the Newcastle area are idle as the result of some industrial dispute. The Government is not taking any action in the matter because that is the function of the Joint Coal Board, whose principal objective is to stimulate the production of coal not only for New .South Wales but also for the other States. Associated with that board is a tribunal for the settlement of industrial disputes, and I understand that the  chairman  of that tribunal is in Newcastle to-day conferring with the parties to the dispute. For that reason I think that the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, and any further comment which I might make on that matter, would not conduce to a settlement of the dispute. </para>

                        <para>- Some months ago I asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General a question relative to the desirability of insanity being regarded by all States of the Commonwealth as a good and sufficient ground for divorce. Although it is a valid ground in some States, that is not so in New South Wales. At that time the Minister said that the Attorney-General, who was then absent from Australia, was particularly interested in this matter, and that it would not be dealt with in his absence. Now that his colleague has returned to Australia, will the Minister make representations to him with a. view to some finality being reached ? </para>

                            <para>- The Attorney-General was himself working on the question of divorce laws in Australia being made uniform. Certain of his departmental officers have been collating information relating to the application of divorce laws in the States. The Constitution permits the Commonwealth to legislate in respect of divorce. As honorable members are aware, that power was invoked recently for the purpose of avoiding difficulty with relation to domicile by reason of husbands and wives moving from one State to another. Arrangements were made which favoured the wives of ex-servicemen of other countries who subsequently deserted them. Those are the only two laws that the Commonwealth has made under the Constitution. The complexity of this task will be appreciated when it is remembered that the divorce laws of the six States are different, and that there are further divorce laws  operating in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory under Commonwealth aegis. I assure the Senate that the drawing-up of uniform legislation in this matter is a very difficult task if even-handed justice is to be meted out and if the conflicting points of view of people in this country are to be reconciled. As the honorable senator has said, where insanity persists for a lengthy period, in some instances for seven years, and where it has been certified that that condition cannot be cured, that is a ground for divorce in some States. Even that has to be looked at from many aspects. When insanity has not persisted for a definite time, and is remediable, it would not be an adequate ground for divorce. That field in itself is difficult. I assure the Senate that the whole of the divorce laws in this country are being fully examined. </para>

Is he also aware that on the 12th February a report was published in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> to the effect that the supply of liquid fuel for auxiliary plants, with the exception of public utilities and a few industries, had ceased completely from the 11th February? The newspaper report also stated that an instruction to that effect had been issued by the Director of Rationing, Mr. J. B. Cuming, after consultation with the Prime Minister. If that report is correct, will the Minister reconsider his decision, with a view to making fuel available to Western Australia to enable industry to be carried on to the fullest extent possible? </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that there has been dislocation of industry in Western Australia as a result of the breakdown of the power plant in Perth. On Saturday morning last I conferred with the Prime Minister respecting this matter, and, as a result, certain arrangements were made between the Prime Minister and the Premier of Western Australia. The Prime Minister approved the Premier's application for 35,000 gallons of petrol to be provided for the generation of power, and a further 15,000 gallons of petrol for purposes associated with refrigeration. I have not seen the article in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> to which the honorable senator has referred. I should think that any statement which Mr. Cuming, the Director of Rationing, would make would  be in accordance with the decision arrived at by the Prime Minister and myself for the provision of substitute fuel for Western Australia. The honorable senator has requested that the position be reviewed. I point out that a similar position exists in New South Wales, where what are known as " blackouts" occur very frequently. I do not mean to be critical of the Sydney County Council. Frankly, I believe that its difficulties in this respect are a legacy from the last war, when, because of war conditions, plant which had been ordered for the  Bunnerong  power station and other power plants could not be delivered. Consequently, such organizations do not possess adequate plant to meet the increased demands arising from the expansion of industry generally. However, if substitute fuel were to be provided whenever a black-out threatened in New South Wales, very limited supplies of such fuel could be made available outside that State. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Minister for Shipping and Fuel whether it is a fact that the 3,000 members of the Federated Storemen and Packers Union in Sydney have imposed a ban upon the removal of wool, skins, hides and tallow from all stores in Sydney. Did the members of that union apply to have their grievances heard by a conciliation commissioner before imposing the ban? If so, is it a fact that the ban is delaying the loading and departure of at least six overseas ships? What effect will the delay have upon the turn-round of other ships awaiting berths? What action, if any, is the Government taking to settle the dispute? </para>

                        <para>- I have read in the press that there is a dispute between the storemen and packers and the firms responsible for the despatch of wool from Australia. From that, report I also gleaned the fact, which was not mentioned by the honorable senator, that the matter was under consideration by one of the conciliation commissioners, who had decided not to deal with the dispute until the men returned to work. Again I say that action by myself or by the Government would not be conducive to an early ' settlement of the dispute. The matter is in the hands of an arbitration official and, in the circumstances, I am sure that the honorable senator, if he were fortunate enough to be occupying the Government bench, would do what I am doing and would not interfere with the arbitration system that has been established to handle such matters. I do not think that interference would secure any political advantage for him. Questions that are so frequently asked in this chamber about industrial disturbances do not help in any way to settle the disputes. If I thought that they could achieve any good purpose, I should encourage debate on the subject of industrial disputes every day. </para>

                            <para>- My attention has been drawn to the report to which the honorable member has referred. The position is that the Tusmore post office, which is of official status, is conducted in premises leased from the Burnside Municipal Council. The accommodation available is insufficient for postmen employed at that office, and they are housed in a portion of another rented building, approximately 300 yards distant. It is proposed to erect an official building at Tusmore, and plans for such a building were prepared two or three years ago by the Department of Works and Housing, in anticipation of the requisite building permit being forthcoming from the State authorities. However, due to the acute housing shortage in South Australia the necessary permission has only recently been obtained. Also, owing to local developments in the meantime, the original plans need some modification, an aspect which is receiving urgent attention. The whole matter is being expedited as much as possible and the department hopes to be in a position to proceed with the work in the very near future. </para>

                            <para>The department intends, when practicable, to introduce official conditions at the Invermay Post Office but it has been necessary to defer the proposal because suitable accommodation, either of a temporary or permanent nature, is not available. A suitable site to permit the erection of a post office building is in course of acquisition and I understand that gazettal of the acquisition is awaiting survey information. An item has been included in the rehabilitation programme of building works for Tasmania for this project but, in view of the great amount of building work to be Undertaken for my department, some little time must necessarily elapse before the Invermay project can be undertaken. Every effort will be made to have the work put in hand with the least possible delay. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> must be confused concerning the vessels owned by the Australian Shipping Board that are being operated by the shipping companies because those vessels have not been leased to the companies. When the time is opportune all ships belonging to the Commonwealth that are now under the control of the Australian Shipping Board will bo taken over by the new authority proposed to be established. Any vessel held on charter which has not elapsed by effluxion of time will also be taken over by the new authority. I should say that immediately accommodation and other factors governing the taking over of the ships have been overcome, those ships will come under the authority of the Australian Shipping Board. </para>

I have in mind the position that obtained in Queensland with relation to air services that were instituted by TransAustralia Airlines, and that under the Constitution the Parliament has no power to control intrastate trade. In the instance that I have mentioned, in order to meet the requirements of people living in the north of Queensland, an agreement had to be made with Queensland to continue intra-state services. I wish to be quite clear that the words "between a place in a State and a place in another State" will be sufficient to enable the Minister, should he consider that it is necessary, to cause a service to be inaugurated in a particular area in a State. Would it be necessary, under the provisions of the sub-clause, for the Government to negotiate with Western Australia to maintain services to connect these particular out-ports with the <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> services, or is it desirable that this provision should be amended? </para>

                    <para>. -  The board, will be empowered to employ temporary, or casual, employees on such terms and conditions as it determines. Officers and seamen engaged on the board's ships will normally be engaged under this clause. After the proposed shipping line commences to operate, the board may find it  to  be desirable at a later stage to engage ships' officers and, perhaps, petty officers on some basis of permanent service. That will represent a new departure in the industry. In the early stages, however, at least officers and seamen will be employed in accordance with articles according to the usual practice on the Australian coast. </para>

                    <para>.- Under this provision, the board itself will be empowered to fix rates and conditions in respect of temporary and casual employees. Would it not be better to provide that such employees shall be employed at not less than award rates and conditions? I recall that many employees of the Australian Broadcasting Commission were paid rates and worked under conditions which were determined by the commission itself, hut many  of  those employees received less than award rates of wages, with the result that there was much discontent. Those employees were engaged in several callings. It is quite possible that a similar position may arise in this instance. Therefore, we should provide that employees of the proposed shipping board shall he employed at rates of wages and under conditions not less favorable than those provided under corresponding awards. </para>

                    <para>.- That provision does not exactly answer the point that I raised. It is quite possible that while employees are endeavouring to obtain an award they may be employed for a considerable period at wages and under conditions less favorable than those provided under corresponding awards. That happened in respect of employees of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in the instance I have already given. Take the position of temporary clerks. I know of a case which arose a little while ago involving clerks employed by the Australian Wheat Board. Tt is quite possible that while an award is being finalized clerks employed by the proposed shipping board could be paid wages less than those provided under corresponding award*. Those rates could  he  fixed by the board in exactly the same way as rates were fixed by the Australian Wheat Board, and if they were less than award rates the employees would be at: a disadvantage until they could be brought under some award. A safeguarding proviso such as I have suggested would protect the interests not only of one group of employees but also of all other persons employed by the board. I have especially in mind the interests of less skilled classes of employees, such as office cleaners. Different awards apply to office cleaners in different States. In Victoria, the Australian Government pays the State award rates for those workers. But the Australian Shipping Board would be able to pay any rates that it liked to  fix  for them. </para>

                    <para>. -  This clause is very slip-shod. Honorable senators who were familiar with the legislation of 1923 will recall that the power vested in the Australian Shipping Board to raise money then was very carefully safeguarded and limited. I notice in this clause that the amount that the proposed Australian Shipping Board may raise by  way  of bank overdraft, without the consent or even the knowledge of the Parliament, will be entirely unlimited. Section 16 of the previous act provided that a bank overdraft or  an  advance from the Treasurer could be obtained by the Australian Shipping Board for working capital. I notice also that this clause 19 does not provide  for  security to be given to the Treasury  for any 'advance that may be made from time to time. It is conceivable that the proposed board, being a corporation and a trading concern, could incur very heavy obligations. Damages for negligence might be awarded against it as the result of an accident, yet some huge amount of money that might have been advanced by the Treasurer would be completely unsecured. The previous legislation provided for debentures to be given by the board to the Government for any advances made from time to time. Furthermore, there was a limitation upon the total amount of advances that could be made. The total amount advanced to the board could not exceed 25 per cent, of the debentures already issued and still unredeemed. If at any time the board wanted to raise further capital, it had to do so by the issue of debentures, but only with the consent of .both Houses of Parliament. In other words, parliamentary control and contact were closely maintained. That was a very sound procedure, and I urge the Minister to accept my suggestion that limits be placed upon the amount that may be borrowed by the proposed board by way of bank overdraft and the amount that may be advanced to it by the Treasurer out of appropriations. I also urge that the board he required to provide security to the Commonwealth for any advances made either by way of overdraft or from appropriations. </para>

The Parliament will have control of the appropriations, and that will be a safeguard. The clause also provides that the board may not borrow money in any other manner except with the consent of the Treasurer. Those safeguards are ample to protect both the Treasury and the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

My point is that there is no provision for the protection of the Treasury in respect of any advances that the Treasurer may make. Earlier legislation of this character provided that any advances made by the Treasurer must be immediately secured by debentures in favour of the Treasury. </para>

                        <para>- And if the shipping line should " go broke ", the Treasury will be an unsecured creditor. The previous legislation provided that, in the event of the hoard controlling the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers getting into financial difficulties, the Treasury would be protected by debenture for the assets of the board in respect of any advances made to it. The clause that we are now considering provides that the. Treasurer may make an unsecured advance of public money to the proposed board. This light-hearted Government may consider that to be a completely satisfactory procedure, but it is shockingly bad business. </para>

                        <para>- No. The honorable senator mentioned competition between the proposed Commonwealth line and private enterprise. What constitutes private enterprise in the eyes of the Liberal party? The Liberal Premier of South Australia socialized the Adelaide electricity supply, and brought the Leigh Creek coal deposits under Government control. Where is the consistency in the arguments advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Sullivan</inline> ? One is at a loss to find any. The Liberal party apparently favours nationalization sometimes, but not always. With the Labour party, of course, nationalization is always in favour, because we believe it to be in the best interests of the country. I should like to know whether my explanation of the concluding portion of the clause is correct, namely, that it relates to uniform taxation which was not in operation in 1923. </para>

                    <para>. -  What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Critchley</inline> has said is quite correct. The clause now before the Committee makes the same provision for the Commonwealth shipping line as is made for other Commonwealth trading concerns. Surely the Opposition would not suggest that there should be an alteration of the taxation principles applied to the Post Office, or the Commonwealth Railways. The object of the clause is to place the proposed Commonwealth shipping line on the same basis as other similar governmental authorities carrying on trading operations. </para>

When this measure becomes law, I assume that some control will <inline font-style="italic">\e</inline> exercised over vessels trading either as passenger craft or cargo boats on our rivers. Not long ago, in South Australia, a river boat which was older than I am, and, so far as I know had been subject only to boiler inspections, struck a snag in the Murray River and capsized. Fortunately, no lives were lost. In other parts of the State similar old vessels are still in use. I should like to know whether the bill .makes any provision to ensure the safety of human life in river traffic. </para>

                        <para>- The clause now under consideration is related to clause 4. The reason for the imposition of a limitation of 200 tons is that it is not considered that the control of licences for shipbuilding and for trading vessels shall apply to very small vessels, which have little significance from the trading or shipbuilding point of view. The interpretation of the phrase " to engage in trade" will he determined by reference to the provisions of clause 30. </para>

Of course, we accept the present Minister's assurance that such a. thought has not entered his mind, but it may be that in the future an administration which is even more socialistic than the present Government will avail itself of this clause to eliminate all private shipping lines. The clause makes it quite clear that no vessel may be constructed or operated without a licence from the Minister, and it follows that a company that is unable to obtain such a licence  may be forced out of business. In that way a socialist administration could acquire every vessel in Australia. </para>

                    <para> - I support the remarks of the Lea der  of the Opposition(Senator Cooper).Read in  conjunction with clause 30, it is apparent that the present clause is designed to confer tremendous power on the Minister. A future minister may decide quite capriciously, or, for that matter, for good reason, to put out of action a particular shipping line, and all that he would need to do to effect his purpose would be to withhold a licence from the line. Of course, my criticism of the provision Li not intended to apply to the present sound Administration, but to some unreasonable, irresponsible, socialist-minded administration of the future! The clause will enable such an administration completely to destroy private shipping lines. As a protection against such a ghastly happening I think that we should include provision for an appeal against the arbitrary power proposed to be conferred on the Minister. If no provision for appeal is made, it means that the Minister will be enabled to withhold his favours from those shipping companies which do not " play ball " with him or his administration.

                        <para>- The clause has been included in the bill for a very good purpose, not for the reason suggested by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Sullivan.</inline> The Government does not contemplate any arbitrary use of the power simply for the purpose of nationalizing the shipping industry. I should imagine that the decision of the High Court, which authorizes the Government to engage in trade and commerce, provided that it does not set itself up as a monopoly, would be sufficient justification for the inclusion of the provision. However, I surmise that the real reason why the clause has been included, in the measure is that it is vitally necessary in order to develop the Australian shipbuilding industry, to insist on vessels being constructed to certain specifications, and for ships to operate in accordance with the requirements of the community. Suppose that a shipping company deliberately determined to defy the Government. Do not honorable senators opposite consider that in those circumstances the Government would require to be armed with certain powers of compulsion? </para>

                        <para>- A big stick, is sometimes needed to bring overbearing individuals and organizations to a realization of their duties and responsibilities. Force is the only thing that some people understand. When the seamen were weakly organized, the shipping companies virtually ignored their repeated requests for an amelioration of their conditions. Time brought changes, and now the seamen, who have a powerful industrial organization, might be said to wield the big stick. To-day shipping companies listen attentively to their demands for improvement of conditions. I think that that fact demonstrates clearly that we need a pretty heavy stick in order to deal with some of the individuals and organizations with which the Government will be concerned. The effect of the clause is that the Government will be empowered, in the event of it encountering serious opposition from a shipping line, to withhold from that line licences to operate its vessels, and also to prevent it, from constructing additional vessels. However, I am satisfied that the shipping companies that are already engaged in this lucrative trade will be only too pleased to comply with the demands made upon them by the authority proposed to be established. </para>

                    <para>. ' - The bill provides that ships shall not be constructed, except under licence granted by the Minister, and that the licence will be subject to such conditions relating to tonnage, design, time, place and method of construction as the Minister may determine. Licences may also be revoked or varied at the request of the licensee. The purpose of the bill is to enable a planned programme of shipconstruction to he arranged for the various Australian shipyards. It is proposed that the construction of vessels shall he distributed amongst the available shipyards, according to the type of vessel to be constructed and the work on hand in the various yards. Orders will be allocated so as to enable vessels of the type that is most needed in the Australian coastal trade to be constructed first. The total volume of shipbuilding will also be regulated, and orders will be spread over a period of years. The Government has already commenced to implement that policy. The reason is that it is necessary to ensure the establishment of the industry on a permanent basis, and the shipyards must he guaranteed continuity of work. One of the main reasons why the industry languished between the two world wars was that whilst there was an unseemly rush to construct vessels immediately after World War I., no provision was made to defer any of that construction so as to keep the shipyards going when the boom had passed. The Government intends that in the initial period of the resurrection of the shipbuilding industry in this country, some work will be postponed to a later period in order to avoid a repetition of the situation that confronted this country on the outbreak of World War II. Whilst we realize the need to replace old shipping tonnage, it is even more necessary to protect the industry, as far as possible, ;i gainst a slump in a few years' time. A ,-pvere slump in the industry would result in the dispersal of plant, skilled manpower and shipbuilding resources. Furthermore, the Government proposes <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> institute a degree of standardization of design. The requirements of certain classes of trade require the construction of vessels of a particular design and equipment, and that need will be kept in mind. However, it is intended, as far as possible, to insist upon standardization, for example, of size, tonnage, hull design,, power units and other important components.  The reason for the Government's decision to insist upon a degree of standardization is the necessity to reduce the costs of production. My remarks are intended to apply not so much to marine engines as to hulls, internal fittings, gear for the handling of cargo and other special fittings. I have previously mentioned that the two vessels recently constructed by the Commonwealth that were sold to private shipping interests were designed largely in accordance with the wishes of those interests. The provisions of the measure will he administered by the Department of Shipping and Fuel, in close collaboration with the Australian Shipping Board, and the board will be responsible for advising the department concerning the allocation of shipyard's and plant. It should be noted that the provisions concerning licences for shipbuilding apply to the construction of all vessels of over 200 tons, whether they are to be employed in intra-state or interstate' trade, and are not confined to vessels engaging in any particular class of trade. It is not confined to vessels engaging in trade. A penalty of ?1,000 or, if the offence is a continuing one, ?1,000 for each day during which the offence continues, is provided for offences against this clause. Although the penalty may appear to be excessive, it is not regarded as "disproportionate to the price of building a ship, which may amount to hundreds of thousands of pounds. </para>

                    <para>. - Although the Minister has given a very lengthy explanation and an indication of the intentions of the Government, I am perturbed about how these licences will be allocated. Many of the ships that the private shipping lines are operating on the coast of Australia are out of date. Under this measure the Australian Shipping Board will be inaugurated. I desire to know whether that board will have first priority for all of the ships to be built in the shipyards in Australia, or whether it is proposed that the shipping companies also will receive an allocation of those vessels. If they are to get little or no allocation I contend that that would  place the Australian Shipping Board in a very favorable position compared with the private companies which are carryon with the older  ship3,  because they would not be able to expand their fleets. [ should be glad if the Minister would indicate whether there is to be any division or priority, and what is proposed to be done in this connexion with relation to the issue of licences to the private shipping companies operating on the Australian seaboard. </para>

By buying ships built in Australia they will help to keep our shipbuilders in employment. </para>

                    <para>. -  I have already indicated that although the contemplated Commonwealth line of steamers will be operating as soon as possible, quite recently two vessels were sold. That indicates that it is not the policy of the Government to " starve " the shipping companies. Of course that depends upon the interpretation to be placed on the meaning of that word. 1 do not say that the authority to be established under this measure will grant, any preference to private enterprise or any one else. Naturally, the first ships built will be for the Commonwealth shipping line. </para>

                    <para>. - The effect of sub-clause 3 (a) is that upon application the Minister shall grant a licence in respect of a ship which is less than 24 years old at the date of the application. I point out that there are in service many ships up to 30 years of age which are still in excellent condition. 1. should like to know what will be the position in relation to those vessels. As honorable senators are aware, in the past, for certain reasons, ships have been built cheaply by various shipbuilding yards in the world. As  a  result they deteriorated quickly, particularly when their maintenance  wa3  not as good  as  it could have been. In many other instances in which  vessels were built in good shipbuilding yards, to high standards, and where their maintenance has been regular and good, they are every bit as good after 40 years of service as are other ships 22 or 23 years old. 1 point out that during the war Liberty ships were built to low standards; in many instances it was only intended that they should make one or two voyages and would then be expendable. Many of the better class vessels which are older than 24 years could continue for years to give excellent service on the Australian coast. In view of the fact that we are very short of shipping I assume that the Minister will exercise discretion in the allocation of licences, and that when a ship is a little over 24 years old and is still required, consideration will be given to maintaining it and keeping it in service. </para>

                    <para>. - Exemption has already been given to ships older than 24 years, for the reasons outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murray.</inline> Some of them are still capable of carrying passengers and cargo and rendering efficient service. I point out that the object of limiting the life of ships officially to 24 years was to provide for a continuity of work in the shipbuilding yards of Australia. A further reason was ro ensure that up-to-date transport for both passengers and cargo would be maintained. 1 think that all honorable senators will agree that those are very worthy objectives. Another important aspect of the matter is that in many of the ships that have been trading on the Australian coast for years, adequate accommodation is not provided for the seamen, firemen, and others employed on them. In the ships recently built in Australia, the accommodation provided for the crew is vastly superior to that in some of the older ships that I have mentioned. This is in conformity with the general trend to-day for advancement in every sphere of Australian life. </para>

                    <para>. - i. thank the Minister for the worthwhile reasons that he has given in support of this clause, and I accept them. However, I draw attention to the fact that in many instances where the hulls of old ships are sound and seaworthy after 25 or 30 years of service, the ships are often  re-engined  and reconstructed, and when they leave the shipbuilding yards, in many instances they are better than they were originally. I assume that this aspect of the matter has received the attention of the Minister and that when applications are made for licences in such circumstances, the applications will be favorably considered. </para>

However, when there is ample opportunity to replace ships, the policy determined upon by the Government, that the life of ships operating on the Australian coast shall be not more than 24 years, will apply.
