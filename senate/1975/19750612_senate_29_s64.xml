            <para>-My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. In view of the fact that the Minister has now been briefed fully, I hope, by the Minister for Minerals and Energy and also, I hope, by the Prime Minister, I ask: Will the Government authorise all people involved in foreign loan raisings to disclose their involvement? Will the Minister inform the Senate fully of the true position relating to loan raisings overseas? Lastly, are documents relating to loans now circulating authentic? If they are not authentic, what action is the Government taking to deny them? </para>

            <para>-Since yesterday I have had the opportunity to have some discussions with the Minister for Minerals and Energy and also the Prime Minister. I am asked whether I have been fully briefed. I suggest that if those people who are so interested in this matter and who have been prepared to throw around accusations of any improper practices by this Government had themselves taken the trouble to read the record over the past few weeks of answers which have been given, especially in the House of Representatives, by both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> and the Prime Minister, they would be fully briefed also. But obviously the campaign is being whipped up <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> a particular individual for the sole purpose of limelighting. If he had done his homework properly he would hot need to raise the matter because the questions which are being asked in the Senate have already been answered in the House of Representatives. I am surprised, now that I have had a bit of time to consider this matter, that there has been so much conjecture. All the questions which have been asked have been properly answered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> the Minister who is directly concerned in this matter. The Government has no need to call for any documents from any person. As I said yesterday, the documents which are circulating have to be authenticated by the persons who allege that they are genuine documents. They are the ones who ought to be determining and proving that they are proper documents. I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he himself ought to table documents which are allegedly in the possession of one of his colleagues- that would be the proper course to take- so that they could become public documents and be properly examined. </para>

            <para>-I did hear the interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> on the program &#39;A.M. &#39; this morning. I am not particularly concerned about what his objections to the Senate are. The question invited <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> to nominate the other things which should have been knocked back by the Senate- for example, why did not the Opposition knock back the legislation providing assistance to Tasmanian industry, which was carried in the Senate only yesterday. I should imagine that the Tasmanian people are glad that this Government has been prepared to put through legislation which in fact assists industries in Tasmania. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> has an objection to that such assistance being provided, he ought to say so, and say it while he is in Tasmania. </para>

            <para>- I would not have thought that I dismissed anything off-handedly. I do not make any apology for the fact that I wanted further information on these matters, and I have obtained that information. It has convinced me all the more that we have nothing but a storm in a tea-cup, and that is the way that the result of this matter will be determined in the eyes of the population. Of course, the proper course for the Opposition to take would be to seek further information, which I will give to the best of my ability. Of course, we have indications that a motion concerning a matter of urgency will be launched later in the day, and I believe that that will be the proper time for the real and truthful arguments to be advanced. </para>

            <para>- My question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General, relates to the resolution of the Senate to establish a judicial committee of inquiry into the pecuniary interests of members of Parliament and to the appropriateness of sections 44 and 45 of the Constitution. The question follows one which the Minister was asked yesterday about delay in the establishment of such a committee. I ask the Minister whether there are special considerations which the Government has taken into account and which have led to the apparent delay, and whether such considerations include the need to avoid any embarrassment to members of the judiciary? </para>

The Attorney-General told me that in his search for the 3 judges whom the Government has decided to appoint he had approached one distinguished judge- whose name I do not think I should mention at the moment- as a beginning. He was the first judge whom the AttorneyGeneral approached. He asked him whether he would be prepared to serve on such a tribunal. I can assure honourable senators that the judge is a man of such repute that I am sure he would be acceptable to all sides of politics. The judge in question said that he would prefer to wait until the matters that are at present before the High Court- that is the matter concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> and the other common informer&#39;s matter relating to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns-</inline> had been disposed of by the High Court. As this judge put it, he thought that he would be embarrassed by adjudicating on such matters before the High Court had handed down its decision. I understand that in relation to the matter concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> it is expected that the High Court&#39;s judgment- the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick- will be handed down in the very near  future. The other matter concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> may take a little longer, but I think the attitude taken by the judge who has been approached is a very reasonable one. I think it would be the attitude that would be taken by any judge who was approached. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I can remember that when the matter came up before the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament, of which I was a member, I expressed the opinion that from my knowledge of the attitudes of the judiciary it would be unlikely that any Australian judge would like to be pronouncing on these matters pending a decision of the High Court. I assure honourable senators that there is nothing sinister about the fact that there appears to be some delay and it is not likely that the contemplated tribunal will be constituted or will commence its deliberations until the High Court has pronounced on the matters before it. </para>

I ask: In the light of his own statement this morning that he now has information which he did not have yesterday, to what person did the Government give authority to negotiate or investigate the availability of the $4,000m loan or the $2,000m loan for which Executive Council approval had been obtained? Will he confirm that no person other than that one person was given authority? </para>

              <para>-Perhaps it is not public. The knowledge that the authority was given is public. I would accept the correction. No other person has been given any authority whatsoever to negotiate in any shape or form on behalf of the Australian Government. As to the person with whom contact was made I understand that discussions were held with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> simply for the purpose of ascertaining where money may be available on the world markets- no more no less. Any person who was in that position would do no more than advise the Australian Government of the availability of funds. As to any power to negotiate on behalf of the Australian Government, that was never given to any other person and I invite the Opposition to produce evidence to the contrary. If the honourable senator&#39;s friend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> has the evidence, bring it into this chamber and table it. If you cannot, I suggest that your argument falls to the ground. </para>

I refer to the attempt by the Prime Minister to remove the Minerals Research Laboratories and Solar Energy Studies Unit from CSIRO and into the control of the Department of Minerals and Energy. In the anticipation that the Minister has taken the opportunity to consider the legal, moral and policy objections raised by me and other speakers in the adjournment debate last evening, I ask: Why is the Government pursuing this policy of vandalism to the detriment of the nation and the future of CSIRO? What is the peculiar hold which the Minister for Minerals and Energy has over the Prime Minister that he is able to force this dissection of CSIRO? Will the Government reconsider its decision in the light of the representations made by CSIRO officials and other responsible persons? </para>

            <para>- I am not aware of when the International Whaling Commission next meets but I believe it is about mid-year, so the next meeting should not be far away. I could not agree with the suggestion of slaughter taking place in the catching of whales throughout the world. I know that this is an emotive issue for many people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> is a long standing conservationist and I can understand his concern, but it would be more soundly based-I say this with great respect to him- if in fact proper safeguards were not being exercised by the Commission. The Commission relies very heavily on the recommendations of the scientific committee of the IWC and that committee has set quotas which have been revised. The precautionary methods adopted to ensure that there would not be over-exploitation have been updated in the last 12 months on the initiative of the Australian Government, supported by the Government of the United States of America. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that the current measures to police quotas provide adequate protection for whales throughout the world. The most important species, as I have indicated earlier, is the sperm whale, and I think it should be stated again that the total world quota for sperm whales this year is 15 000. The scientific committee of the IWC estimates that the total world population of the sperm whale is about 350 000 so the world quota is about 3 per cent of the estimated world population of that species. I can assure the Senate that Australia plays a leading role in matters concerning the preservation of whales and the initiatives taken last year by Australia were without doubt a step forward in the conservation of whales. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. What inconsistency does the honourable senator see in the statement by the Prime Minister that he removed <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> from his position as Treasurer because of letters <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris&#39;</inline> statement last night that yesterday he contacted <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> with a proposal for an overseas loan which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> is now actively pursuing? </para>

Has the Minister noted that the Commission&#39;s terms of reference require that it examine family, social, educational, legal and sexual aspects of the male and female relationship? In view of the diverse and contentious nature of these subjects, when does the Government expect to obtain tangible results for the time, effort and money being put into such an inquiry? </para>

            <para>- In the first instance I remind the honourable senator that the Royal Commission on Human Relationships owes its establishment to a proposition initiated in another place by private members and subsequently a resolution carried by the House. To date, the Commission has received and is in the process of analysing hundreds of written submissions. It has conducted a series of open house meetings in most of the capital cities throughout Australia. Currently it is engaged on a program of public hearings scheduled to be conducted throughout Australia. Whilst there is still an immense amount of work to be done by the Commission, nonetheless I am told it is satisfied that its inquiries will enable it to make recommendations of a very worthwhile nature to the Australian Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am informed the Commission considers that even with the work that has been undertaken to date it has already brought a number of opposing groups to a closer understanding of each other&#39;s point of view, and that the documentation already on hand and available to the Commission indeed will make a significant contribution to current studies of social conditions in Australia. Having perused the terms of reference of the Commission and, in the short time I have been Special Minister of State, having been able to study some of the work that it has undertaken to date, I am confident that the findings of the Commission will lead to improvements in the life of the individual in our society, improvements which perhaps cannot be measured in purely monitored terms but which will more than justify the time and effort of those who are contributing valuably to the work of the Commission. </para>

            <para>- As has been stated on many occasions, negotiations concerning overseas loans or matters pertaining to them are confidential to the Government. They always have been. They were before this Government came to office. This was a procedure followed by the Liberal-Country Party Government before 1972. This Government is not acting improperly in any way in not making public details of negotiations that may take place with any person or persons in respect of overseas loans until such time as finality is reached on those negotiations. </para>

Does the Minister say that neither Dolmac Consultants nor any other person has or ever has had a mandate by way of agency or commission? If the answer is in the affirmative and since on that basis the letter must be either a forgery or a fraudulent utterance by the writer, is it not vital that the Australian Government should investigate the matter and take action to provide proof of forgery or fraud? Does not the Government have an urgent duty to make clear to all financial circles throughout the world the true nature of this and other letters circulating and purporting to be mandates? Does the Minister now say that all such letters are spurious. Have they no validity at all? </para>

The fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacDonald,</inline> the same <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacDonald</inline> who signed this letter, denied on an Australian Broadcasting Commission program, I think last night and possibly again this morning, that his company had been negotiating with Australia.

            <para>- I am not aware of the rules governing the availability of information on police files, the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the files of other American agencies. I know that the question of what criminal intelligence data should be kept secret and what should be available for perusal by interested people is receiving attention in many countries. The Attorney-General has referred this matter to the Australian Law Reform Commission which is drawing up the necessary safeguards for public interest in police investigations. That Commission will report to the Government in midAugust. I anticipate that the report will be available to members and senators and that it will set the standards which will apply in any new system of police enforcement in Australia. </para>

The next part of the honourable senator&#39;s question betrays a curious naivety about relations between sovereign states. He has asked whether we will insist that China accepts voluntary restraint. How does he propose that we impose such a condition? Is he suggesting that we should send a gunboat to throw a few broadsides off the Chinese coast to compel the sovereign state of China with its 800 million people to do exactly what the Australian Government wants it to do? </para>

Will the Minister confer with the Attorney-General to determine whether the same remissions can be extended to women and minors in prison in Australia, also as a gesture of leniency in recognition of International Women&#39;s Year? </para>

            <para>- I have seen the news item referred to by the honourable senator and, as one who has had occasion to criticise the Soviet Union for its restrictions on international freedom, I welcome the evidence of a loosening of such restrictions. I think that the suggestion that fell from the honourable senator is a worthy one and that perhaps we could take a leaf out of the Soviet&#39;s book in this regard. I will certainly convey his request to the AttorneyGeneral. </para>

            <para>-There are really 2 parts to the question- the suggestion that some form of commission has been offered and the suggestion that there is something improper about that. I am not aware that such loan moneys have been negotiated by anyone acting for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns.</inline> I do not believe that to be the case. But it is customary, no matter with whom one deals on the overseas loan market, that some form of remuneration is eventually negotiated once agreements concerning loan moneys have been entered into. For the sake of the record I should like to have incorporated in Hansard a table showing the percentage of expenses paid by Australian governments, going right back to 1967, on various loans raised in London, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Japan. It shows percentages as high as 5.13 in the case of a loan of 60 million Swiss francs raised in 1970, and 5.06 in the case of another Swiss loan in 1 968. All this occurred, of course, under the previous administration, not under the Labor Government. For the record I seek leave to have this table incorporated in Hansard so that people will be able to see that no great crime has been committed in any government suggesting that any person who might arrange a loan for that government should receive some remuneration for doing so. </para>

Is it not a fact that the authority given to the Minister for Minerals and Energy to make investigations as to the availability of money was an attempt by the Government to break the longstanding arrangement created by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government in raising loans through Morgan&#39;s of New York? ls it not a fact that for many years the previous LiberalCountry Party Government arranged loans through Morgan&#39;s of New York and paid substantial amounts of interest? </para>

              <para>- Yes, that is a good example of great and powerful friends and explains many of the attitudes of the same gentleman over the years. It is true that channels of contact for loan raising have been established overseas by Australia over a number of years, but we are in a very different position today in relation to the matters which will be dealt with later, I am sure, in the urgency debate. A government is not in any way precluded from exercising its own judgement, providing there is nothing illegal or improper, in seeking loan moneys from other sources if those moneys are in fact available. In the particular case that has been the subject of so much muck raking by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> over the past few weeks, in respect of which he is unable to produce any proof, the Government has not acted in any way illegally or improperly. </para>

            <para>-Yesterday my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden,</inline> was able to advise me that the Treasury publication of economic statistics has shown that improved unemployment benefit paying procedures have resulted in the number of registered unemployed being reduced by 4500 people during the month of May. I believe that this is a matter of some significance because it appears quite obvious from the information that has been provided that in the past the numbers of unemployed that have been shown in the statistics have been inflated because of certain imperfections in the system of making available unemployment benefits. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>According to the Department of Labor and Immigration the number of registered unemployed decreased during May by 1 7 290 compared with a reduction in unemployment during April of 5428. It is our opinion that the reduction during May- the considerably greater reduction, although there was a reduction in unemployment during April- was due largely to the more intensive checks being made of people who are on the unemployment register. Last April, in order to overcome the difficulties and delays which people were finding on some occasions in the weekly payment of unemployment benefit, my Department- the Department of Social Security- changed the paying procedure. Instead of payment being made on the lodging of a weekly income statement at an employment service office the procedure was altered to require a statement to be furnished by the beneficiaries directly to the officers of the Department of Social Security by post once each 4 weeks. Weekly cheques are accompanied by a notice requesting beneficiaries to notify the Department when they commence work. </para>
          <para>This change in the procedure has enabled officers in the Department of Labor and Immigration to concentrate more on their responsibilities for maintaining the register of unemployed up to date. I think the Senate and the Australian people will be interested to know that these procedures have shown that at least to a certain extent the unemployment figures in this country have been artificially inflated and that this artificial inflation has been reduced, if not eliminated, by the introduction of more efficient procedures. </para>

            <para>-The answer to the last part of the honourable senator&#39;s question is, of course, none. No commission has been paid to the said gentleman and none will be paid. That has been stated half a dozen times in the House of Representatives yet questions are still dragged up about commissions in order to keep that particular issue going. In all probability the honourable senator had not done his homework because if he had he would have found that exactly the same answer was given in the House of Representatives some time ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> is a person whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> asked to investigate the source of possible finance available to the Australian Government. He was considered to be, despite again the accusations which have been levelled against him, a reputable person. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> quite properly saw fit to ask him to seek out the possibility those funds in exactly the same way as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> was asked. But in both cases no authority whatsoever was given to negotiate on behalf of the Australian Government. </para>

            <para>- In his policy speech delivered a little over a year ago before the double dissolution election, which resulted in the rout of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> did undertake to provide half of the cost of building a new general hospital in Launceston, something which had been neglected for 23 years by LiberalCountry Party governments. The Tasmanian Government has accepted the offer which was made by the Australian Government consequent upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam&#39;s</inline> undertaking. The planning of the hospital is now proceeding and the Australian Government is doing everything that it can, through the Department of Health and its Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Everingham,</inline> to speed the development of this project. A development plan has already been prepared for the new hospital under the direction of a steering committee. The steering committee includes representatives from the Australian Departments of Health, and Housing and Construction and the Hospitals and Health Services Commission. The development plan defines a 3-stage program of development in which a new acute general hospital facility will be redeveloped on a site immediately adjoining the existing hospital. The existing main hospital is proposed to be converted for use for the delivery of psychiatric, geriatric and rehabilitative care. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline>would no doubt know, as a senator who lives in Launceston, unlike some people who have recently taken an interest in that area, that the Australian Government announced in 1974-75 Budget a 5-year hospitals development program of capital assistance to the States for the development of public hospitals and other health institutions. During 1974-75 an Australian Government grant of $1,833,000 was approved to assist the Tasmanian Government in the construction and improvement of hospitals. With these funds the Australian Government has helped the planning of the new Launceston General Hospital redevelopment and it will continue to meet its commitment in respect of this project as each stage of the redevelopment is negotiated and agreed to with the Tasmanian authorities. The action that this Government has taken with regard to the Launceston General Hospital is indicative of the attitude which the Australian Labor Party Government has taken ever since it has been in office, that is of doing everything which it conceivably can for States such as Tasmania, which was so neglected for so many years under the previous Government. </para>

That is purely a matter for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> The same situation applied, as I mentioned, in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> as he spelt out the position in an interview on the radio program &#39;PM&#39; last night. He said that he was required only to do that. He was not required to negotiate, nor was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline></para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Has the Minister seen documents currently being circulated bearing the names of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dennis</inline> Walker and others which purport to be on ministerial letterhead? Can the Minister advise whether his office produced the circular and what action can be taken if the circular is, in fact, a fraud? </para>

            <para>- I have seen a copy of the document that has been circulated. It is signed by Dennis Walker and a number of other people, mainly from the Aboriginal community in Sydney. The document seeks donations for Dennis Walker&#39;s High Court appeal against his extradition to Queensland. The paper bears the Government crest and shows that it is from the office of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. It has a code letter (R) at the top. Obviously this letterhead came from my office, the office of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. The (R) indicates the official in that office who dictated the original letter. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Investigations disclose that the original letter was an acknowledgement of a letter received from Dennis Walker. This letterhead with a message on it has been produced in the pamphlet. It has been photostatted to make it appear that it has the approval of the office of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. No approval for collection of funds for Dennis Walker&#39;s appeal has been endorsed by that office or supported by it. While I suppose something can be done about it, I am inclined to think that Dennis Walker is in enough trouble now and it is not my intention to take the matter any further. </para>

              <para>- I do not know what has happened to the document since the time it was quoted from, but it did exist. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> gave a particular date and then referred to its being signed by the Treasurer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> spoke on a personal explanation and said it had been authorised and gave some authority. It was an authentic document. It was an admission that he was quoting from a document. Apart from Ministers refusing to table confidential documents from departmental files, I have never known anyone who has had a document which supported his argument and who refused to table it voluntarily. I would understand the reluctance if there were some secrecy about this document, but it has been quoted from here. The honourable senator does not have the courage to table the document. That immediately raises suspicion about the document. </para>

Here is the first opportunity to obtain some concrete evidence about a document, but the person who has the document wants to hide it. He claimed that he was quoting from an authentic document.

              <para>- You can have the notes. If you want the notes I am prepared to table the notes. Here, you can have the whole lot of them. I object to motives being imputed against a person, and statements that he is dishonest or afraid. I have been here for 2 5 te years and I do not think that I have ever been afraid to vote for or oppose in accordance with what I considered to be the right thing. When I refer to these matters I do not do so with a lack of knowledge. I happen to have had contacts with people who have been associated with this loan development, first in Amenca and then amongst the Arab people. I was the person who arranged the interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> for one of these people, so when I speak I do not do so with a lack of knowledge of the whole process. </para>

I agreed to grant leave to the tabling of a document that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> wanted to table. But the motion is for the tabling of the document from which he quoted. While he has tabled one document I honestly suggest that it is not the document from which he quoted. A long time elapsed between when he quoted from the document and when he tabled a piece of paper on which, I take it, his writing appears. He got up subsequently - </para>

              <para>- But point of order is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> said: &#39;I have made notes from the documents- the letter- which was the letter that I had shown the authorities who said it was genuine and had made notes from it, and that is what I was reading out today! &#39; He tabled that piece of paper. Standing order 364 states: &#39;A document quoted from by a senator . . . &#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> stated that he had handwritten extracts from a document and he was quoting from it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> may not have the document in his possession at the present time, but the motion which I seek to move is to seek an order of the Senate to table the document from which he was quoting, not the notes which he made from the document and from which he read. </para>

              <para>- Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President</inline> We have heard standing order 364 referred to. It refers to the tabling of a document quoted from. That obviously is the document, if there is a quote, from which the senator made the quote at the time he was on his feet. It is not customary in this place, unless the standard of the Senate has fallen to bedrock low, to hear imputations against an honourable senator that a document which he has tabled is not the document from which he quoted. I suggest to the Senate that the proposition that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> is now advancing is a complete distortion and corruption of the standing order. It refers to the document from which the senator quoted. It does not refer to other documents from which notes may have been made. My point of order is that imputations of a scandalous nature are being made against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> who said that he has tabled the document from which he quoted. That should be accepted by the Senate, or a substantive motion should be moved to challenge the honourable senator&#39;s integrity. </para>

They were tabled. I explained to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> that he could proceed with the motion or withdraw it.

              <para>-I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> might get a chance to speak later if he can get on the list. This is a matter which has been concerning me for quite some time in its broader aspects. I think it will have concerned other people. Therefore I want to deal with some of the broad issues that lie under this spectacular series of claims and counter claims. I think it has been for many of us a worrying business. I am of the clear view that the time has come for the Australian Government to explain what has been going on and, if it can do so, to clear up the misunderstandings. That is the purpose of the motion. The Government has been given a chance today to set out the facts, to explain the situation, to try to clear up misunderstandings and if possible, to clear its reputation and its name. But we give notice as a Senate Opposition that we regard this whole area as being so serious that we will continue to press on with our inquiries into this matter in order to elicit in due course the total assembly of facts that bear upon this matter. I believe that Australia deserves no less from the Senate. It does not really need any comment from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> who is trying to interject because we are dealing here with a serious matter and I am taking it seriously even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> is not. On this last day of a long session one would not rise lightly to get involved in a matter which may go well beyond today. Accordingly I formally move: </para>

              <para>-Overshadowing this whole matter is the situation of extraordinary deficit finance entered into by this Government. These are the order of deficits in recent years by Australian Governments: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="064232197506120_16_1.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para>For the year ending 1975 the estimated deficit was $5 70m and the possible deficit will be $2300m. For the year ending 1 976 the deficit will possibly be $3,700m. </para>
          <para>The critical matter with which we are dealing, among other things, is how the Australian Government is going to fund this order of massive deficit. That is the substantial problem facing the Australian people, facing the Government, facing the Senate and facing the Opposition. All kinds of strange exercises in overseas borrowing have been talked about, contemplated, discussed and ventilated, but overseas borrowing of the magnitude suggested will greatly compound Australia&#39;s problems because such an overseas borrowing program would add to the already expanded money supply to the point where one would find it almost impossible to see how inflation ever could be brought within bounds. </para>
          <para>So, first of all, how is the Government going to fund its deficits? What is it going to do? Clearly, it has been going around the world for quite some time talking in a very loud and noisy fashion about overseas borrowing. But it has alternatives. It can seek to raise its deficit finance by a local loan on the Australian capital market. The last loan so issued failed. The Government has been talking about raising a small amount of money- $ 100m- in New York. We have heard nothing about the success or failure of that attempt. So one begins to feel that we may be considering some kind of compulsion on Australian domestic savings lying ahead of the Australian people if they are to fund the acts of this Government. That is the substantial matter which lies in this general area. If that is not to be done, what then are we looking at? The printing of money? The funding of the exercise by Treasury Notes and the Treasury Bills with the Government borrowing from and lending to itself on the one day? There is a substantial problem here, and I want to quote very briefly from a work by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gilbert,</inline> &#34;The future of the Australian Loan Council&#39;. These matters must come to resolution, and I imagine that they will come to resolution fairly soon when the Premiers and the Prime Minister gather together with their advisers. At page 15 he states: </para>

            <para>Clause 3(8) of the Financial Agreement provides that loans to finance revenue deficits by the Australian Government or the States shall be included in the loan program. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Government has been looking at borrowing money overseas clearly to finance deficits which have not yet been included, as far as one can see, in the loan program. There is another reference to clause 3 (8) on page 68. 1 will table that book so that honourable senators who wish to inform themeslves further can do so. </para>

              <para>-Senator Georges, we are not being helped by you. You are a nice chap, but if you are quiet everybody likes you a great deal better. There is a proper way to borrow money overseas and there is a past practice to be observed in this matter, whether the Government likes it or not and whether in the process of its discussions it seeks to denigrate people who have been occupying positions of high office in this Government in the past. Australia has overseas a substantial body of men who represent the Treasury, and they are in contact at all times with the overseas loan market. They know what is going on in finance around the world. There are Treasury officers in London, Washington, New York, Geneva, Tokyo, Paris and Brussels. Would it not have been sensible, if overseas loan borrowings are to be considered, for the negotiations to be conducted in the normal way by discreet inquiries through the officers of the Treasury stationed around the world and through Treasury itself in a proper discreet fashion? I seek leave to table a document entitled Treasury Officers Stationed Overseas &#39;. </para>

            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Government over the last couple of years, for reasons of its own, has broken substantially with past practice. I am suggesting that in that process Australia&#39;s credit in the overseas lending area has been endangered. Where is all this money we hear about? What was the fate of the US$100m loan we heard about recently? We have heard all the speculation, but what comes out of this is a nasty feeling that Australia&#39;s credit is perhaps being endangered. Once upon a time Australia used to be country noted for breeding and exporting confidence men, but it seems to me that we have lost that talent. We seem to have become the victims of confidence men both overseas and local, and the local ones were not bred here. </para>
          <para>I suggest to the Senate that the whole Government is responsible in this matter. It is not good enough to leave it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> to defend the Government&#39;s position. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> is responsible; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> is responsible; the whole Government is responsible. I noted with interest last night while listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden,</inline> the new Treasurer, that he seemed to me to be rather anxious to evade responsibility for any past actions, and that of course I would naturally understand. I believe that the Government has a responsibility properly to itself and properly to the country to explain this whole position to Australia through the Senate, lt is true that in all situations- people become involved in difficult affairs- this is sometimes very difficult, but in the sense of corporate responsibility, which we are all engaged in from time to time, in the end the men of integrity and capacity have to clear themselves. They cannot in the end stand responsible for acts which they find themselves unable to believe in, if the facts prove this to be the case. </para>
          <para>Australia as a nation is going into overdraft in a massive way. In effect what we say to be our assets and our future earning capacity are going to be pledged. We have heard a lot from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> in past years about the fact that we were a country huge in resource; the world was rushing us with money; anywhere we liked we could get it; they all wanted to come here. The carpetbaggers arrived in droves because we were a country of immense promise, immense resource, immense capacity and there was no problem. We heard this and things like it in debate on the Australian Industries Development Corporation. We have heard all this in the past. The great assets which we have are yet to be developed in the sense of borrowing to develop them. </para>
          <para>What we are borrowing for now is to finance a fairly large overall extravagance. We are going into overdraft to do that. Someone will have to get the cash together and the resources to make the effort to produce the revenue to pay off this sort of loan. We are talking about a future charge upon the Australian people and their children. I think that under those circumstances everybody has a substantial right to be concerned. Various sums of money have been said to be involved in this exercise of what I call public controversy about Australia&#39;s loan raisings. It has been very hard to get any illumination on the actual amount of money being talked about. That could well be clarified. Are we seeking to borrow overseas? If so, how much money? If so, for how long? Can we be told the rate? Who are the lenders? Who is arranging this? Why is it necessary to go about it in this way? What is wrong with the traditional method by which we have managed to do ourselves fairly well and achieve good results in overseas borrowings? When I have been worrying about this- I have been for some months now- I have wondered that perhaps this is why we have seen this consistent rubbishing of Treasury and its officers, and this perhaps is why the current permanent head of the Treasury is under some degree of challenge by the Government. </para>

              <para>-I would like you to do that and to illuminate this scene more accurately. If people are to be charged with things, I hope it will be done properly and they will be given a chance to defend themselves because, if there are any star chamber tactics, the Opposition stands ready to try to defend the people involved. Let there be no doubt about that. There are many matters to be cleared up, today or later. We have heard all sorts of things. We even had Press reports this morning. I cannot vouch for them. Nobody can vouch for them. There are said to be telexes mentioning $4,000m. There is said to be an amount of $20,000m. This is all too great for me. I am a fairly simple person in matters of finance having, I think, $2.25 in my pocket at the present time. But I am concerned about this total position. </para>

          <para>There has been too much speculation; too much public talk; too many people involved in these acts- people who have not the training or the discretion to be so engaged. These are matters on which the proper officials of the Government and the proper people of responsibility, both in this country and stationed around the world, should be able to advise quite adequately. I have other colleagues who have a great interest in this matter and they will pick up other areas of reference as we proceed through this debate. We will be wanting to hear, as I said earlier, from responsible persons on the Government side, proper explanations of these matters if those explanations are available. I serve notice on the Government that the Opposition at the moment is a long way from satisfied about the wisdom, probity or common sense of this whole exercise in loan raisings in which the Government has been engaged. </para>

            <para>- The debate on this matter of urgency comes about as a result of issues raised by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, namely <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Phillip</inline> Lynch. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> has a record of carelessness in making public statements. We all recall, for example, his great faux pas during the Vietnam war. We remember the water torture case. He said that there was not a scintilla of evidence to prove that there had been any water torture in Vietnam. It was not long before he had to eat his words because he was proven wrong. It was not long ago that he was making statements about a certain person who will be named during the course of this debate. I will name him now. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani. Mr Lynch</inline> made statements about his having a criminal record. It was proved that that also was a false statement. It was a slanderous statement, utterly untrue and used solely for the purpose of trying to discredit that person and in turn the Australian Government, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> in particular. So much for the validity of the arguments used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> and also for his personal credibility. Even last night we heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacDonald,</inline> who has been involved in this matter according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> denying the sort of things that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> has been saying.

              <para>-That was a good point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges.</inline> I intended to raise it anyhow. It would be interesting to know if the Opposition is prepared to lay on the table of the Senate the documents relating to some of the people that he has been talking to in certain places in order to get the scanty facts that he has. This is the basis on which this debate is taking place. It is taking place on the basis of unreliable information from an unreliable person. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>What are the facts? We have known that for many years there have been traditional sources of supply of overseas money for nations that wish to borrow, and Australia has been a regular borrower on the world&#39;s money markets. Great supplies of money have been arranged through Europe, from Switzerland in particular and Germany, the United States of America and more recently Japan. Established avenues have been used by the contacts and agencies which Australian Governments over the years have had in those various countries. But over the past 18 months a dramatic development has taken place. There has been an enormous shift of capital from those countries to the oil exporting countries, an amount of the order of $70,000m. </para>
          <para>Is it not obvious that as a result the normal channels available to a government have to be reconsidered? Would it not be an absurdity if any government, the Australian Government or any other government seeking borrowings, was to neglect and disregard the new sources of lending which have become available? No government would be committed for ever and a day to remain tied entirely to those normal channels through which it could determine where moneys were available. This Government, like other governments, is quite entitled to explore the avenues that are available to it in various parts of the world. But it was absolutely essential for the Australian Government, realising the need to make contact with these new sources of loan moneys, to adjust and change its methods as it saw fit and the avenues that it used to explore where these various sources of capital could be located. </para>
          <para>It is true, as I indicated during question time today, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> was authorised- this point ought to be restated- to investigate the possibility of raising a certain amount of money on overseas markets. The authority did not extend beyond <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor.</inline> No other person was authorised to negotiate loans on behalf of the Australian Government. One person, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> was asked to obtain details of possible sources of funds in a particular place. Having obtained such information, he was to report back to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> without any commitment whatsoever. Then, if the Australian </para>
          <para class="block">Government saw fit, the matters would be negotiated by Reserve Bank officers between principals only. Yet for some reason or another this seems to be regarded as some terrible thing which has been done by the Government. At no time was it ever suggested, let alone was such an authority given, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> or any other person had any right to profess to have an authority from the Australian Government. </para>
          <para>The document circulated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> is almost an absurdity. It alleges that the writer of a particular letter, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr L.</inline> MacDonald, claimed in the letter: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We hereby confirm that we are the holders of an exclusive mandate from the Government of Australia, represented by the Minister of Mines and Energy; confirmed by E. G. Whitlam, Q.C., Prime Minister; J. F. Cairns, Deputy Prime Minister; L. Murphy, Q.C., Attorney-General; and R. F. X. Connor, M.P. . . . approved in council by J. Kerr, Governor-General. </para>
            <para>In this mandate we are authorised to negotiate a loan of US Dollar funds totalling 4,000 million. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is a completely absurd statement, a completely irresponsible paragraph in that letter. Subsequently of course <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacDonald</inline> denied that any such mandate was ever given to his firm. We can only be left with doubt in our minds. I am sure that during the course of this debate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> who seeks to interject, will be able to give us unqualified proof of the authenticity of that document. If he cannot, there is no point in his constantly seeking to interject on that score. The fact remains that that document which purports to claim a mandate from the Australian Government in fact gives no such mandate at all. That is the essence of this whole question. At no time was anybody authorised to negotiate loans on behalf of the Austraiian Government, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline></para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline>referred to the deficit which the Australian Government expects in the forthcoming Budget. Of course he did not claim to know how much that deficit would be. The Government has indicated on previous occasions its desire to minimise that deficit. But it should not be assumed that any of the moneys that may have been sought on any of the world money markets would be used for that purpose. It was indicated previously that there are many areas in which such loan moneys could be utilised- for payments to the States, for the Australian Industry Development Corporation and for matters related to energy requirements. It is said that Australia finds itself in a terrible position. But as was indicated here only a day or so ago the United States finds itself with a bigger budget deficit problem than we have in Australia. </para>

              <para>- Yes. At the time I indicated that $70,000m was proportionately higher than the estimated $3,000m in this country. Quite apart from the fact of what arrangements might be made by the Government to finance the deficit of the Budget, nothing has been borrowed under these arrangements which are the subject matter of the debate. No offers were made. No communication was given in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> to the Government to say that the money was there and that therefore the Government could have it, if it wished. No loan offer was made and no such offer had to be accepted. So it is quite erroneous to suggest that because that person was used to examine the source of funds there was anything improper. It was certainly a departure from what may be described as the traditional means of establishing the source of funds on the world money markets. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I repeat, and I believe it is important that it be understood, that there was nothing illegal or improper. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> went on to say that there were all sorts of things to be cleared up and that all sorts of documents were floating around. He admits that he cannot vouch for the authenticity of any of these documents. Why is it that if these documents exist and if they are authentic they have not been brought into the Senate chamber and tabled? Why is it that the Opposition cannot find one single document to indicate that any authority was given to any person to negotiate loans on behalf of this Government? The Opposition has been challenged. It has been asked to do this. It will not do it because it cannot do it. That is the simple answer. It is quite true that there are properly qualified people in this country who are competent to negotiate loans. As I have indicated, they are the people who would do any negotiating flowing from the information which may have been received concerning the source of funds. I do not fully comprehend the thinking of the Opposition in this case except if we assume that the whole purpose of the exercise is a deliberate attempt to discredit this country in the eyes of overseas lenders. No other possible motive could be behind the motion. </para>
          <para>Again we have had reference by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> to the $100m loan being raised on the New York market. He said that we have heard nothing about the loan and that Australia has been discredited. I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> and to honourable senators opposite that they will hear something about it tomorrow. I am glad to be able to advise the Senate that the loss of credibility on the part of the Government is a complete fallacy. It is something which the Opposition, in its own mind, has conjured up for cheap political reasons in Australia. When the New York loan announcement is made it will establish beyond any doubt that the loan being raised in accordance with the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which seeks the most stringent conditions from any borrower, indicates that the credibility of this country has in no way been damaged. </para>
          <para>I am quite sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> will be among those who will be bitterly disappointed to know that Australia&#39;s credibility still stands very high in places from which we traditionally seek our sources of funds. I think this is one of the most unfortunate matters which has been dragged across the arena for some time. There was no doubt in my mind from the beginning that all proper procedures had been followed by the Government. Yet despite that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has made a whole series of accusations based on material which cannot be authenticated. If the Opposition is so sure of its position one would assume that it would be much more forthcoming than moving a motion to debate a matter of urgency, because that debate will not establish anything. One would presume that the Opposition would like to go further than that if it really believed that all this information was correct. </para>
          <para>It is a great shame that the time of this Parliament must be taken up with matters which are based purely on hearsay and rumour. I doubt very much whether in past years we have seen a more puerile exercise than that which has been conducted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> for the sole purpose of some sort of self-promotion. I do not intend to cover all the matters in my initial remarks other than to outline the broad aspect of Government policy. But I trust that during the course of the debate other speakers on the Government side will be able to demonstrate to the Australian people in various ways the total falsity of the arguments and of the alleged case that has been instigated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Phillip</inline> Lynch. </para>

            <para>-I think that the first thing that should be stressed is that this motion criticises the Government for its failure to make a full disclosure regarding overseas loan transactions and for not tabling one document which would substantiate the claims which it is now making to the Parliament. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> as the Leader of the Government in the Senate, has said today has disclosed some chinks of light which however have not dispelled in any way the darkness which surrounds that whole transaction. I simply wish to say one or two things by way of preliminary reference to what he said. He was concerned to regard this motion as being in some way a matter of abuse and personal attack upon Ministers. From the Opposition&#39;s viewpoint that is not the case at all; we are seeking information. I think I should correct the record at the outset, in view of an imputation which was made earlier this morning. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies is not, and never has been, a director of the Morgan Bank of New York. If one looks at the names of the VicePresidents of the Morgan Guarantee Trust Company of New York the only familiar name which appears is that of Nicholas R. Whitlam. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline>has been challenged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> for allegedly having been careless of the truth. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> &#39;s conduct in this matter has been one of creditable diligence in endeavouring to ascertain the facts of the situation which have not been disclosed to the people of Australia. He was concerned, as those who saw his appearance on television only 2 nights ago will recall, to stress that he could not authenticate a document or say whether a document was genuine. He was at pains to stress that. But he said that the existence of the document raised 2 questions: If it was genuine the Government has been concealing and has a lot to explain. If it was not genuine the Government really ought to conduct a most intensive investigation to find out why fraudulent statements were being made about what the Government had authorised or to ascertain who was responsible for the forgery. </para>
          <para>As the Government has been ready to command the Commonwealth Police to move in on so many occasions in the past for far less important matters than whether the Government is being wrongfully charged with having granted a mandate to borrow $2,000m, it is surprising that there has been no reference whatsoever to any concern by the Government to investigate this matter. One also might ask: Why is it that in this very important debate we find the advisers&#39; benches on the Government side empty of any representatives of the Treasury, any representatives of the Department of Minerals and Energy and any representatives of any Government department? Is that a fair indication of the way in which the Government treats this matter? I further say, and this is in direct response to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> and follows on what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> said, that we have developed over the years a pattern of having Treasury representatives located in the significant places throughout the world where finances may be raised, as required. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> tabled a document which shows where they are. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt:</inline> If there are new areas of finance opening up why does not Treasury have its representatives in these new areas? Why is it that we involve ourselves in these apparently murky transactions about which the Government is not prepared to give any information whatsoever and which raise the suggestion that our credit worthiness is not as good as it should be? </para>
          <para>One of the questions to which the documents would give the answer is whether the Government was having difficulty in raising finance in the traditional centres of the world and had to resort to this type of approach in order to get the money it was wanting. Might I say to the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> it does not in any way answer any of the problems connected with the reason for the Government wanting to borrow $2,000m to say simply that we may hear tomorrow that $100m was able to be borrowed. Is the Government&#39;s success to be measured by the fact that having sought $2,000m it is able to borrow only $ 100m? </para>
          <para>Let me return to the particulars of the general case which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> opened up. The first mention of this matter was in December last year when the private secretary of the shadow Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> sought information from Treasury about allegations that Australia was engaged in loan raising. The proper reply which the private secretary received from Treasury to his proper inquiry was: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Approaches were made recently to the Australian Government for loans to it on behalf of unidentified principals. The Government placed itself in a position to investigate the approaches. In the absence of identification of the principals, the Government withdrew from further investigation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was last December, but the rumour persisted and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> asked a question when Parliament resumed in February. He was brushed off by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> who simply said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Matters relating to the currency, loans and the commercial credit of the nation should be handled with the utmost discretion. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is a matter of record that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> was issuing statements calling upon the Government to explain what was happening, and to confirm or deny information which he believed was important and which the Government could have denied if the facts were untrue that would have set at rest all the concern that was being felt by the Opposition. On 23 April this year when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> asked a further question of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> all <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> could say was:   . . borrowing transactions are a matter of confidentiality and responsibility and will continue to be so treated. </para>
          <para class="block">We have seen in the last few weeks such a revealing miscellany of apparently inconsistent statements, of cover up and a failure to give information that this motion is made a perfectly justifiable call upon the Government to explain itself. </para>
          <para>I mention some of the questions asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch.</inline> Is it correct that letters have been exchanged between the Treasurer or <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt and the person to whom the brokerage was to be payable? Where are the letters? Is it a fact that the international institutions normally involved in the Government&#39;s loan arrangements were by-passed in favour of an individual with alleged Middle East connections? Why was borrowing authority given to the Minister for Minerals and Energy and not to the Treasurer? Was advice received from the Treasury and the Attorney-General&#39;s Department questioning the legality and the economic consequences of the loan? The Minister made no statement in the Parliament or outside the Parliament in answer to any of those questions. If those things had not occurred why could not a statement have been bluntly made that there is no truth in any of those allegations? Nothing was said. </para>
          <para>Is it not a matter of concern to wonder what it is that the Government is hiding? The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam ) said in the Parliament on 23 April that none of the money was to be expended under the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act, but on 20 May he said that the borrowing was for matters relating to energy. In between times the former Treasurer said that not only would the States benefit by it but that the highest priority would be given to energy purposes under the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act. That was said at his Press conference on 8 May. In all this we have the statement that Loan Council approval had not been obtained. Loan Council approval was not obtained for a loan sought to be gathered in Australia&#39;s name for $2,000m. Is it any wonder that a responsible Opposition seeks to find out the facts? Is it any wonder that after we ask question after question and are given the brush off we come to this point and seek to get the information that we want.</inline></para>
          <para>Who are the intermediaries who have been authorised by relevant Ministers? Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> was dismissed as Treasurer because he authorised a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> to investigate whether money was available. Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns,</inline> in the light of questions asked this morning, has given all the facts to the Parliament is a matter still to be probed. I would hope that this is a matter that is regarded as being of some consequence so we will learn whether or not <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> offered a brokerage of <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> per cent. These are matters which ought to be explained. </para>
          <para>We have sought to find out who were the intermediaries authorised by the Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor).</inline> The Minister said in Parliament in May that there was a careful letter of identification to an intermediary. We find that the Prime Minister at his Press conference this week said there was no letter; there was a cable. This morning, for the first time in this Parliament, after 2 questions I asked yesterday, 2 questions I asked today and a fifth question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume,</inline> the Leader of the Government in the Senate acknowledged that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was the intermediary, and we are assured that he is the only person. If he is the only person, what is the reason behind the other letters that are floating around about which the Government appears to be not at all concerned and which suggests that an exclusive mandate has been given to another company? This word mandate&#39; is curious in the context. The Minister for Minerals and Energy on 22 May used the same word- an unusual word in the context in which these circumstances have developed. Furthermore, we find reference to an exclusive mandate. The Prime Minister himself, when he explained why the Executive Council authority had been revoked, indicated that it was revoked because the general pattern overseas was that when you gave an authority of this character it was an exclusive authority, and therefore it had to be revoked. </para>
          <para>These are the matters upon which a probing Opposition has sought information and in respect of which the Government has not been forthcoming. We have a system of government in this country which depends upon the Parliament being able to exert its authority over the Ministers who come from that Parliament, and Ministers are expected to be responsible and responsive to that Parliament. If that is not able to be sustained, the efficacy of our system must be under challenge. So much depends upon an Opposition in its willingness to probe and to push. It is only 2 years ago that we heard so much from the paragons of virtue who now disgrace so many of the offices they hold that open government was the great plea and the great need in this country, but we do not hear very much about open government today, because this Government has set new standards in concealing matters from the people of Australia. I think it is a matter of great regret that we are called upon to move this motion, but we do it because the circumstances have left us no alternative. It is up to the Government to give far, far more information than it has already given. </para>

            <para>- I have found great difficulty in detecting any coherent theme in what has been put to us today, and indeed in the line of questioning that has muddied the waters of this place over the last few days. What is it that is alleged against the Government? Is it wrong for the Australian Government to seek to get its hands on some of the billions of petro-dollars that are floating around the world? I am greeted with silence. Is it wrong to deal in financial matters with Pakistanis? Is that alleged against the Government? Should we be dealing with reputable American banking firms, such as has been the practice in the past, instead of dealing with reputable Pakistani authorities? Is that alleged against us? Is it alleged that it is perhaps wrong to deal through people with whom one goes to the football? That raises the interesting question of the deals <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies may have cooked up here and in England when he went to the cricket. </para>

At the present moment I am answering the outrageous charges that have been made by a reckless and unscrupulous Opposition which is quite unconcerned with Australia&#39;s credit abroad. If there has been any damage done to Australia&#39;s credit and its ability to raise funds, it has not been done by this Government; it has been done by a reckless and unscrupulous Opposition which is prepared to grasp at any straw in order to attempt to discredit this Government. </para>

          <para>In any event, we have the spectacle of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler conducting his secret investigations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and being unable to come up with anything damaging to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> I may add, by the way, that the Government had made its own inquiries about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> The suggestion that there is something murky about it, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> paranoid term, just will not stand up. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> is a reputable member of the firm of Dalamal and Sons, an old Pakistani firm centred in London. We made our inquiries through Morgan Guaranty, among others, and we got nothing but good reports about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> The fact that he did not come up with any money is beside the point. The only thing that matters is that he is a reputable man, outside of the main stream, perhaps, of international finance, but as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> pointed out in his statement in the other place, there is nothing odd about that. We are in a totally new situation. The fact is that because of the energy crisis and because of the increase in oil prices there has been a totally unprecedented redistribution of the world&#39;s wealth and the money markets of the world have shifted from their traditional sites and the petro-dollar, which is as good a dollar as any other dollar, is to be found in unexpected places. Is it at all surprising that a Pakistani firm or a Middle East firm, or some firm that was not centred on London, Zurich or New York, would have more ready access to petro-dollars than would the traditional firms? That is the reason why we went outside the established lines to attempt to raise this money. We suggest that to say there is anything sinister about that just would not stand up. </para>
          <para>Another very interesting thing about the whole matter are the curious double standards that we get from the Opposition. This morning in this place one of its own, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood,</inline> stood up and made allegations from a document. These gentlemen opposite who are always screaming for us to table documents rose to his defence and divided the Senate on the question of whether he should be required to table the document. </para>

            <para>- Before I return to the burden of the motion before the Senate, I wish to give some information concerning the Right Honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">An allegation was made this morning- by interjection it was stated that there was a tie-up with great and powerful friends- that he was a director of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York. I am informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline> private secretary that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> was never a director. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies was on the International Council of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York from 1968 to 1972. 1 am assured that that is a group which dispenses charitable moneys provided by the company. It has nothing whatever to do with the management of the bank itself. The  chairman  of the Council during that period was the Right Honourable Lord Shawcross, formerly Attorney-General in the Attlee Labour Government. I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland has now left the Senate chamber. He has stated in the debate that there is more than one company. That is one and the same company in which Nicholas R. Whitlam is listed as a vicepresident. So much for the sort of interruption we had this morning in an attempt to defame a very distinguished Australian. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> said that he could not understand the theme that the Opposition was trying to get at. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland did this morning was to give the evidence of why he has been promoted by the Prime Minister. He had been promoted to a more significant portfolio whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron, as somebody said, has been blinded with science. Basically, he has been promoted because his chief role seems to be that of the Prime Minister&#39;s hatchet man to carry out the execution of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler, one of Australia&#39;s most distinguished public servants. What the Minister did this morning brings no credit upon himself and very little credit upon the Senate. </para>
          <para>The documents produced are very interesting. The Minister asks what is the theme. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Larkin</inline> &#39;s document is dated 23 May 1975. It is all about a conversation of 13 December 1974. It is some time since I practised in the semi-criminal jurisdiction or the criminal jurisdiction. But I always thought that notes had to be made reasonably close to the event to be of any real value. The evidence of a policeman who wrote up his notebook days or weeks later was not always that good. Apart from that, I ask the question: Why did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Larkin</inline> prepare on 23 May 1975 for the file this note of something which occurred on 13 December 1974? That is something I would like to have answered. </para>
          <para>I thought also that the Minister- I hope I did not mishear him- said that this note was for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Lenox Hewitt. If that is so, why is the First Assistant Secretary of the Treasury preparing a note concerning his departmental head for the head of another department? I ask that simple question. I accept the Minister&#39;s statement that the minute paper to the Executive Council is the correct copy. As my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> points out it is not the final document because it does not bear the Governor-General&#39;s signature. But this appears to be sent from the AttorneyGeneral &#39;s Department. This was crossed out and Department of Minerals and Energy&#39; written over the top. That is by the way. When the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> answered a question in the Senate this morning I thought that the burden of his speech was that the most anybody had been authorised- that was the Minister for Minerals and Energy- to do was to investigate whether there were some funds available abroad. </para>
          <para>Let us read what the Minister tables as authentic documents. I will leave out all the stuff at the top of the document about $4,000m. I am not taking things out of context; I am just getting down to the heart of the document. It reads: </para>

              <para>- It strikes me as more than interesting. I ask the Senate: What is the Minister up to? This is a gorgeous red herring. The Minister comes in and says he has a minute paper from the Executive Council. He tables it with a great flourish and says: &#39;We have got nothing to hide&#39;. He now admits that it is not the real minute paper, that it is only a draft. Does the Minister not agree with that? That is what he is saying. </para>

              <para>- Yes, where have they all gone? Who will reply to me in this debate? Will it be one of the boys from Queensland? Why do the Ministers not get up and defend the Government? Where have all the front bench tall poppies gone? Are they rushing off to see the Strangler to get further instructions? Is that where they have gone? I know that suggestions have been made about what further action the Opposition might take. Let my put some things on the record quite plainly. In no circumstances does the Opposition intend to let the matter rest when this debate is concluded. Some time this afternoon the Manager pf Government Business in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland)</inline> will move the motion which is normally moved at the end of each period of sitting, that the Senate at its rising adjourn to a date to be fixed, when the  President  shall summon honourable senators back. That date is expected to be about 19 August. I give notice now to the Government that I will move an amendment to that motion which I trust the Senate will carry, and that is that an absolute majority of the Senate will have the capacity to recall the Senate should circumstances require it in the meantime. We know very well that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> by the use of his numbers in the other place- and I do not object to that - </para>

              <para>-Because I knew that you would interject and so I thought that I would say it. The Prime Minister has sent the House of Representatives off into legislative limbo until 19 August. It is well for Australia that he cannot do that to this place. Therefore I give notice that the Opposition will attempt and hope to convince the Senate that the Senate ought to be recalled if something further arises. It has been suggested that committees should perhaps be set up. That is still a matter for consideration. I note that this morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> gave notice that he may seek to have people called before the Bar of the Senate. This matter also has been within the consideration of the Opposition and will remain within its consideration. </para>

              <para>-I realise that, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> has given notice of an intention, as he is entitled to do. I mention these things because the Government may think that it can come into this chamber today and bandy around documents and notes for the file, trail red herrings across the place and attack people who are not here. That is a very simple thing to do. The Government hopes that the problem will go away when the Senate rises tonight. For what it is worth, let me assure the Government that the problem will not go away. These sorts of things have a habit of staying around and becoming worse. If as the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> said earlier this morning, this is nothing but a storm in a teacup, why does he not get rid of the storm in the teacup by tabling every document concerned with this episode from its commencement some time prior to 13 December 1974. Let him put all the documents on the table. If he does not put them on the table - </para>

            <para>- Before addressing myself to the debate I should like to say that I do not think the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> enhanced his reputation in this place by snidery asking where were the Ministers in this chamber and saying that he would be followed by the boy from Queensland. Does he deny Queensland senators the right to participate in this debate? After all, Queensland is a State that has given to this Parliament 3 eminent Treasurers- E. G. Theodore, Fadden and the present Treasurer, Bill Hayden. But I do not know that the State that the Leader of the Opposition represents, Western Australia, has a record to equal that. However, I am not going to be too sensitive about the matter, but it is typical of the criticisms that the honourable senator makes of people on the Government side when he has no evidence to support the claims that his colleagues have been making. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Ever since the December 1972 election when the Liberal-Country Parties were thrown out of power, and now that they are the Opposition, they seem to have flatly refused to accept the verdict of the people; they do not seem to realise and appreciate that they are no longer the Government; that they are the Opposition. They beieve that, like the Stuarts&#39; divine right of kings, they have the divine right and duty to occupy the Treasury benches. We have seen that they will come at anything to achieve these ends. We have seen them in operation as the Opposition for 3 years now. The pattern of their strategy is falling into place. When the Government introduces measures on matters such as health, welfare and education it receives tardy and qualified censure from the Opposition members. They use every pretence and pretext to delay the measures. But any attempt to discredit the credibility of the Government is trumpeted with the loudest blast throughout the nation. </para>
          <para>Let us examine the urgency motion that is before the Senate today and see what all the fuss is about. The motion is very broad indeed; it covers a wide spectrum. But is there any charge of dishonesty or improper practice contained in the motion? Of course there is not. Let us put the situation under calm and careful consideration. With regard to overseas loan raisings, the availability of funds today is quite different from what it was, say, 2 or 3 years ago. However, we hope that one practice still remains, and that is the practice that when governments, irrespective of their political persuasion, have been successful in raising a loan their success has been welcomed by the nation because loans have been required for national purposes. They were even hailed by the State governments because the States would have benefited from the transactions also. That is how it should be, and let us hope that it will continue to be that way. </para>
          <para>Since 1973, with the increase in the price of oil, an amount of some $60,000m has changed direction; it has come under control of different people. A large amount of that money was being invested in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe for wealthy individuals in various financial circles. The competition to lend is keen. We heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> say here this morning that he was approached by an intermediary. I was approached by an intermediary who said he was representing Denis Lee, the  Chairman  of the Moscow Norodny Bank in Singapore, and the brother of Lee Kuan Yew. He claimed he could get the money. So there are intermediaries all around the place. One wonders now whether, because the Singapore Branch of the Moscow Norodny Bank did not get the lending authority it might be trying to discredit the Government. One wonders what is happening in these things when one sees letters floating around and being bandied around throughout the community by the Opposition. This Government has, as any other government has, a responsibility to ascertain the circumstances with respect to the availability of these funds. Other governments took similar steps to explore new areas for available funds and available investment. Their steps were justified. If we had not done so we would have been vulnerable to criticism for failing to do so. That would have been the cry of the Opposition. It would have told us: &#39;There is an abundance of petro-dollars available. What are you doing about it?&#39; </para>
          <para>Let us turn our attention to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Phillip</inline> Lynch. Just how reliable is he? He has engaged in a smear campaign against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> in order to discredit the Government. He has implied that the Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor),</inline> a most highly respected member of this Parliament for a long period of years, has been dealing with people of no repute in arranging funds for the Australian Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> has claimed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> has a criminal record and was engaged by the Government to do the rounds of overseas financial institutions. What are the facts? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> has again been played as a sucker. He has been misinformed about or has made up these accusations against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani. Mr Khemlani</inline> has been cleared by the Treasury and by Scotland Yard. My colleague the Minister for Labor and Immigration, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, earlier gave complete and adequate answers to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> &#39;s false claims regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> This is only another occasion on which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> has been proven to be the carrier of false information. </para>
          <para>Sure we remember his stance when he denied the water torture incidents in Vietnam. He later capitulated and admitted certain water torture incidents. What about his denials of a man called O&#39;Neill being chained in the trenches in Vietnam? He capitulated again and admitted he was wrong. There is no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> will be proven wrong again, just as he was proven wrong on the 2 Vietnam issues and on his denial of a claim of bastardisation in the Army at Duntroon. Since I have been a member of the Senate </para>
          <para class="block">I have seen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> conceive many things. He has conceived on many occasions, and nothing has happened. I submit to the Senate that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> must be barren. Whether or not he is barren, he is certainly acrobatic. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser was making his run against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden, Mr Lynch</inline> &#39;s footwork was so complete that everyone knew that he had a foot in each camp. The only reason he did not have a foot in the third camp, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peacock&#39;s,</inline> was that he had only 2 feet. So much for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch.</inline></para>
          <para>Let us turn our attention to the self-appointed representative in the Senate of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch.</inline> I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood. Senator Greenwood</inline> has repeated all the charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> and has attempted to make out that in the Government&#39;s negotiating overseas loans, in petrodollars, for $4,000m somebody was doing something improper, that as a result of the one per cent which was mentioned as brokerage somebody stood to make $40m and that somewhere, somehow the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam), Dr J.</inline> F. Cairns and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> were connected. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> also included his old friend, the former Leader of the Government in the Senate, ex-Senator Murphy. What a contemptible state of affairs. Being a member of a ministry and a former Attorney-General, the senator should know that all governments, whether they are Labor or Liberal-National Country Party governments, traditionally deal with brokers such as Morgan Stanley and Co. Inc. of New York. It has been traditional for expenses, fees and brokerages to be paid. </para>
          <para>Earlier today, at question time, my Leader had permission from the Senate to have incorporated in Hansard a list of loan raisings by the LiberalCountry Party Government, together with the percentage of fees and expenses paid, between 1967 and 1972. So the electors of Australia can be informed and can judge for themselves whether this Government is acting illegally or improperly, as claimed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and the Opposition, I will read out the loan borrowings by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government and the amount of fees and expenses that were paid for the period 1967-72. In 1972 there was a Japanese loan for $9. 8m. The expenses were 1.93 per cent. In January 1972 there was a German loan for DM 100m. The expenses were 3.09 per cent. In 1971 there was a loan from the Netherlands for f60m. The expenses were 1.55 per cent. I can give further examples. There was a Swiss loan for SwF60m and the expenses were 5.06 per cent. There was a German loan in July 1968 and the expenses were 3.15 per cent. There was a Swiss loan in April 1967 for SwF50m and the expenses were 5.16 per cent. In 1967 there was a German loan and the expenses were 3.20 per cent. The average percentage of expenses and brokerage paid on loans arranged by the previous Liberal-National Country Party Government during the period 1 967 to 1 972 was 2.97 per cent. </para>
          <para>This is the traditional procedure followed by Liberal-National Country Party Governments. It is the traditional procedure that has been followed by this Government and, no doubt, will be followed by governments in the future. This whole affair has been a despicable attempt to discredit this Government. The charges made by the Opposition have not been supported. As I said earlier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> has been played for a sucker. The Opposition, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> in his demeanour and his stance in these matters, is like the old Irish policeman who, having apprehended the prisoner and having questioned him, said: &#39;You might be right; you might be wrong; but I do not think so&#39;. That is the attitude of the Opposition in this matter. </para>

Contrary to that, I do not think the people of Australia learned anything from listening to the honourable senator because his whole speech was a great tirade directed at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> Apparently the honourable senator, in going back to 1972 and saying that this Opposition still thought that it was in Government, had forgotten entirely the actions of members of the Australian Labor Party when it was in Opposition. I remember many occasions in those days when the then Opposition took the business out of the hands of the then Government and defeated and amended legislation. Yet, they claimed this was all in the interests of the country at that time. They claimed this had nothing to do with denigrating the Government in those times; far from it. They claimed they were looking at the legislation and trying to improve it. Now when the Opposition, which sometimes has the numbers, tries to amend legislation it is acting despicably, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe.</inline></para>

              <para>-Before the suspension of the sitting, we were discussing an urgency motion which had been moved earlier in the morning by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> from the Opposition side of the chamber. He had used the forms of the Senate to seek further information about overseas loan transactions carried out by the Government. This action was necessary because for some time Opposition senators had been seeking information without success. I believe that the motion is perfectly justified despite the criticism of Government senators. Immediately before the luncheon adjournment I was reminding Government senators of some of their actions in the past when they were in Opposition in this chamber. Without any factual information and a great deal of innuendo, they had brought motions of no confidence against two of my colleagues- without success, I might add. But those motions had very little fact about them. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>This morning we elicited only a small amount of information, despite the number of speakers from the Government side. We know that there are Treasury officials stationed overseas who negotiate Government loans in those areas. We know that in the past the Government has dealt with or raised loans overseas through many reputable and well established financial institutions. On this occasion we are sure that Government loans could be handled by these institutions or by the Treasury officials stationed overseas with professional competence. We do not see why the Ministers of the Government should authorise their own nominees or acquaintances to seek out funds abroad- something which I believe has made Australia the laughing stock in the financial circles of the world. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Labor and Immigration, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, when making his contribution to this debate talked about petrodollars and said that there were new areas of money available to the world. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland:</inline> ls he saying that this money is available on black market lines, or is it available and known to the established institutions and to the Treasury officials of this country? I should like him or some of the Government speakers who will come forward, to tell us the reason why the Government should seek out this money from the areas from which it is seeking it. Why not go to those people who have handled loans in the past? </para>
          <para>I was greatly interested in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> &#39;s submission when he tabled a memo dated 23 May 1975 which detailed a private conversation held some 6 months before. I should like to ask the question- and I hope that Government speakers will be able to inform the Senate- why a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Larkin</inline> should write a memo to the Head of the Department of Minerals and Energy about his own permanent head? Is the action of the Secretary of the Treasury in investigating <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> &#39;s background without telling the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> such a crime? I should like to know the answer to that. After all, the Secretary is the head of the Treasury and the matter did involve many thousands of dollars. I ask the question: Who else could do it? Why should <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland table the memo and then make the statement that the Head of the Treasury had gone behind the Prime Minister&#39;s back in investigating this man? This is the reason why this motion was brought before the Senate. </para>
          <para>We have had 3 question time periods- if today is included- in which matters arising out of loan borrowings overseas have been raised by a great number of senators. On every occasion- perhaps there is some reservation about today- the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> has fobbed off the questions. I know, as all honourable senators know, that the Leader of the Government is a man who generally does his homework. Generally he gives a pretty good answer to the questions he is asked, and no matter how many times he is asked a question he gives an answer and explains the situation. He has done that time and time again on questions that have been asked in this Senate relating to wool and meat; yet he has sidestepped the issues that have been raised during every question time this week. Why did he do that? Is it because he has something to hide? Is it because the Government does not want the Senate, and particularly the Opposition, to know what is going on? Or is it because the Government does not want the people of this country to know what is going on? </para>
          <para>Every time a question has been asked on this matter the Leader of the Government has said that he is not compelled to answer because the Opposition has not produced any information. If we abided by that ruling, there would not be any questions asked in this place, particularly from the Government side. Quite often I have seen Government senators handed pieces of paper by Ministers and, knowing nothing about what they are asking about, they get up and ask Dorothy Dix questions. At other times they have asked questions based on headlines in newspapers. Government senators particularly did this when they were in Opposition; they came along and asked questions based purely on the headlines without reading the following letterpress. Information has been provided today by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, but nothing was said by the other Government <inline font-weight="bold">speaker, Senator McAuliffe,</inline> about what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> had said. All <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> did was to pose a great number of questions that he suggested have to be explained in this place. I hope that the next  speaker  for the Government will provide some further information. I believe that the Opposition has done a great service to the people of this country in bringing forward this urgency motion. </para>

            <para>-As has happened on, I think, every occasion since I came into the Senate on which the Opposition has launched an urgency motion, frequently in a very aggressive and confident manner, today the course of the debate has turned right around and the Opposition is trying desperately to defend its effrontery in launching the motion in the first place. That happened in relation to the Ermolenko affair, the South Vietnamese orphans and the South Vietnamese refugees, and the pattern seems to be repeating itself today. Just as an aside, I was interested to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> complain about the pre- 1972 Opposition having the audacity to take the business of the Senate out of the hands of the then Government. The irony of that is that such action could not have been taken before the 1 972 election without the support of Democratic Labor Party, the Party that endorsed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> and helped elect him to this Senate at the 1974 elections. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DrakeBrockman</inline> was the Democratic Labor Party candidate, No. 1 on the Democratic Labor Party ticket, for the 1974 Senate election. So I find it ironic, to say the least, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DrakeBrockman</inline> should see fit to chastise the Party which endorsed him, an endorsement which he accepted and under which he sits today in this Senate. However, that is an aside. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As to the debate proper, once again we are being subjected to the spectacle of the Opposition wasting the time of the Senate, wasting the time of every member of the Senate in a sordid attempt to gain some political mileage from a non-issue. As has happened previously, the attempt has backfired on the Opposition. The one substantial point which has emerged from this debate today, the one piece of evidence which has been adduced to corroborate the fantastic charges which members of the Opposition have made in this chamber and in the other place, is that at some time in the past the Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> wrote a letter to a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> a representative of a firm of London merchants and traders. The letter, of course, was a letter of introduction. It was not a commission or a contract to write loans on behalf of the Australian Government. That, of course, is not news. It was acknowledged in the other place by the Minister for Minerals and Energy himself some weeks ago. The rest of the falsehoods which Opposition members have presented here have been fabricated by either the honourable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> or the people who fed the information to him, including the honourable member&#39;s own allegation in the House of Representatives when this matter first arose or his own inference that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was some sort of crook who was under investigation by Scotland Yard. That story, of course, was blown. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> had been investigated by Scotland Yard- which is another story- and Scotland Yard had given him a clean reference. </para>
          <para>The other major falsehood or fabrication which had been fed to the Press by the honourable member for Flinders was that the Australian Government had authorised the firm known as Dolmac Consultants as sole agents- I think that was the term which was used- for raising a substantial loan for the Australian Government. That allegation blew up in the face of the honourable member for Flinders, as had his previous fabrications and falsehoods. It was unequivocally denied by the general manager of the firm concerned in a statement last night on the television program &#39;This Day Tonight&#39;. I will quote what was said and I will table the transcript of what was said if the Opposition would like me to do so. It reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The General Manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacDonald,</inline> confirms that he was indeed an international financier involved in raising money overseas but he told us he had been given no authority by the Australian Government to negotiate or raise loans. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So that blew up on the honourable member for Flinders. </para>
          <para>The other possible justification for the Opposition moving this motion is that it believes that such matters should be handled only in accordance with established Treasury procedures, that I think being the term which was used. I do not know why the Opposition insists on this rigid adherence to the pattern of orthodoxy especially in a changing world. It could, I suppose, be because of the Opposition&#39;s innate conservatism. It could possibly be that some powerful friends of the Opposition were in the habit of obtaining commissions on loans previously raised. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe,</inline> who spoke earlier in this debate, has already given some indication of the very substantial commissions which were available on loans which were raised by the previous Government in accordance with these established Treasury procedures. It may possibly be that there were some kickbacks like the alleged kickback from the Dillingham mining company to the Queensland Government. It was alleged that $100,000 was paid into the funds of the National Country Party in Queensland by this company in return for favours from the Queensland Government. I dare say those diligent members of the </para>
          <para class="block">National Country Party who represent Queensland in this Senate will insist with the same tenacity and the same aggression they have displayed today that the Government of Queensland should conduct a royal commission into that allegation to establish whether the Dillingham company did pay $100,000 into the slush funds of the Queensland National Country Party, or perhaps the Opposition was just outraged at the thought of any deviance from the line of orthodoxy. </para>
          <para>Apparently the Opposition thinks it quite intolerable that the Government, any government, should object to a situation wherein the Permanent Head of the Department of the Treasury castigates a subordinate for transmitting a message in such a manner that the Prime Minister could have discovered what the Treasury was up to. Apparently it is incomprehensible to the members of the Opposition that any government should object or should have any reservations whatsoever when one of its major departments behaves in that manner, or when the head of one of its major departments sees fit to castigate one of his subordinates because his security has been so slack that the Prime Minister might discover what the Treasury has been up to. </para>
          <para>Given the weakness of the argument which the Opposition has attempted to present, it is not surprising that it should have drifted into an indefensible position. When the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> was speaking, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> had the effrontery to raise a point of order because the Minister had referred to certain disclosures concerning the Department of the Treasury, and particularly the head of that Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> raised a point of order on the ground that it was quite improper that the Minister should canvass these matters since they were already the subject of an inquiry ordered by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> It is interesting that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> should have taken that view. I presume that he approved of the Opposition&#39;s raising this matter of urgency today to canvass those very matters which already are the subject of an inquiry ordered by the Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> in that instance has applied a double standard. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> is the representative of the antediluvian wing of the Liberal Party- the personification of the antediluvian wing of the Liberal Party. That is the sort of double standard for which the Liberal Party has become infamous. It is the sort of double standard which enabled it to posture and pose as the champion of the liberty of the individual against the tyranny of the State while at the same time it was sending out press gangs to dragoon Australian youths into fighting a war in IndoChina, a war in which Australia had become involved on the basis of a tissue of lies circulated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> &#39;s party and the Government formed by his party. </para>
          <para>The other major distortion came from the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers),</inline> who seized upon the Executive Council minute and attempted to distort it. In fact he did distort that minute in a fruitless endeavour to prove that it established that the Australian Government had authorised an agent, be it <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> or someone else, to negotiate loans on its behalf. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> who is a lawyer and to the best of my knowledge a lawyer at least of medium competence, would know very well that that minute authorised the Minister for Minerals and Energy to negotiate loans on behalf of the Australian Government. It did not authorise any other person who may be delegated by the Minister for Minerals and Energy to raise loans on behalf of the Australian Government. </para>
          <para>It seems that the Opposition in a sense has been the victim of a self-promotion exercise by one of its members, that synthetic man, that habitual headline snatcher, the honourable member for Flinders, who has been building up his image, no doubt in anticipation of the next Liberal Party blood bath. I daresay that the honourable member for Flinders could anticipate, perhaps with considerable glee, another meeting at the godfather&#39;s flat at Toorak when the jackals of the Liberal Party prepare to pick the bones of the Leader that they appointed in the godfather&#39;s flat on the ides of March last. Maybe, about next March, after the Liberal Party fails to win the by-election in Bass, its members will be asking what is wrong with their present Leader and beginning to look for another one. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Flinders, whose political ambition is well known and is without bounds, will be very anxious to promote his image in such a way that he will be favourably considered. Of course he has some handicaps to overcome. He has probably an innate and, some would even be uncharitable enough to say, a well deserved, inferiority complex. But above all, he has the tremendous handicap of being a Roman Catholic and trying to reach the top in a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant Party. I suggest that the members of the Opposition should seriously examine the proposition that they have been used in this instance by the habitual headline grabbing honourable member for Flinders in pursuance of his own personal political ambitions. </para>
          <para>In the couple of minutes that remain to me I should like to say something about the ethics of stealing. Clearly the one substantial piece of evidence which the Opposition has managed to present in this debate, namely, the Khemlani letter, was stolen by, or stolen on behalf of, a member of the Opposition, presumably for the honourable member for Flinders. It is interesting to note what the Premier of Queensland had to say when some documents fell into the hands of the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I am not concerned with the Opposition&#39;s attempts to use stolen information to try to embarrass the Queensland Government ... the Opposition is deserving of the severest censure for its lack of ethics in this affair. </para>

            <para>- When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland spoke this morning on the matter of urgency that is before the Senate he said that no theme is alleged against the Government. I wish to state that the theme as we see it and as it is unfolding is the pursuit of facts and truth with regard to overseas borrowings on behalf of the Australian Government. It is a matter of pursuing from a point which is as yet obscure to us. We would like to have started at the beginning and to have worked through this thing to a conclusion. It seems to me that we are starting somewhere in the middle and we do not know whether we are going forwards or backwards. But we intend to use the theme of the pursuit of truth and facts so that they may be placed on the record and we may get an understanding of the matters which we are pursuing. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think what has been developing in the Senate today is evidence of a breakdown of government. It is evidence which indicates that the opportunity is being taken to denigrate the head of the Department of the Treasury. Also, I believe that the Department of the Treasury in its entirety is being denigrated by the Government, in the contributions which Government senators are making today. In asking a question of the Leader of the Government in the Senate this morning I referred to the established procedures of the Treasury.  His  answer to me with regard to bypassing established Treasury procedures was that he had referred to the matter earlier in his reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges.</inline> He indicated that the Government was at liberty to use whatever channels were available to it if it sought information concerning the source of funds in world money markets. He said that there was nothing improper or illegal about that. If we analyse that statement we have to ask the question: Is the Minister talking about bypassing the established offices of the Australian Treasury as they are situated in the world money markets? Is he talking about using those offices or is he talking about using some other source of which we have seen evidence in the procedures about which we have been talking for the past few days. </para>
          <para>Let me refer to the breakdown of government. Those of us who represent the Parliament on the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Public Accounts know that that Committee has investigated the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. We saw there evidence of a breakdown in communication and relationship between the head of the Department and the then Minister of the Department. I do not in any way want to develop what has been an investigation by the Public Accounts Committee. If members of the Government Party in the Senate do not understand that there has been a breakdown of government when there is no relationship between the head of a Department and his Minister then they do not understand the functions of the Australian Administration. We have seen this sort of development. I think the opportunity that is being taken today to denigrate the Department of the Treasury is evidence of this breakdown of government. It is not a breakdown between the head of a department and some Minister because they may not be able to work together. We have an assertion by honourable senators on the Government side that there is no need to work through established government procedures or departments. </para>
          <para>Since this Government has been in office we have seen an unprecedented increase in public administrators in Australia. Yet it is being asserted that the Government can use other means to do the things which have to be done on behalf of the Australian people. The way in which a note was written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> T. Larkin on 23 May relating to matters which occurred in December is evidence of the way in which we will use any means to denigrate an individual or a department. Again this is evidence of the breakdown of the relationship which ought to be part of a cohesive government. It is the Treasury through which we deal throughout the world, as was said this morning. It is the Treasury which is denigrated in this Parliament. If the Treasury is to deal on behalf of the Australian people on markets throughout the world, I think it goes into those markets in the future with less credibility than it had in the past. </para>

This is not a matter of removing an individual. The need is to have an operation which hangs together as an administration. Parliamentary Ministers are responsible for the administration and the relationship with the Australian people. </para>

              <para>- I suggest the Minister let me make my point. What was not read out earlier was the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the minute. It reads: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>The Australian Government needs immediate access to substantial sums on non-equity capital from abroad for temporary purposes, amongst other things to deal with exigencies arising out of the current world situation and the international energy crisis, to strengthen Australia&#39;s external financial position, to provide immediate protection for Australia in regard to supplies of minerals and energy and to deal with current and immediately foreseeable unemployment in Australia. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Are the functions that are set out in that memorandum the exclusive responsibility of the Minister for Minerals and Energy? I suggest to the Senate that they are the responsibility of the Australian Treasury. The Minister for Minerals and Energy has had placed in his hands wide powers, including authority to borrow $4,000m for temporary purposes; authority to borrow and to determine on behalf of Australia the terms and conditions of the borrowing; authority to authorise any other person to enter into an arrangement and to sign the necessary document; authority for and on behalf of Australia to issue any promissory notes; and authority to take any other action and execute any other documents required or permitted to be taken or executed for the purpose of making the borrowing. Such wide powers should not be placed in the hands of the Minister for Minerals and Energy. Those powers are the widest powers that could be given to an Australian Treasurer to work through the established Treasury procedures. That is the point I am making. </para>
          <para>I am not at this stage interested in who has the letters, who has developed the letters or whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> &#39;s credibility is better than that of any other person. I thing we are examining the foundation of government and fundamentals of government administration in Australia. That matter has developed, perhaps unexpectedly, from this debate today. There has been the revelation through this minute of the wide powers that were given to the Minister for Minerals and Energy, which have been referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> as being powers to investigate. These are not powers to investigate and report back, as was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt.</inline> They are not powers to investigate and report back and then for the Reserve Bank to act as principals. That is what was said this morning and yet the minute of authority from the Executive Council is so wide ranging that it does not relate to the Minister for Minerals and Energy at all. It relates to the Treasurer of Australia. I think we need to ask why this has developed from the pursuit of facts that we started because people were running around the world with letters and pieces of paper that purported to be some sort of authority to borrow on behalf of Australia. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline>McClelland suggested that the onus of proof was on us. This matter could have been skillfully dealt with by the Government and should have been dealt with by the Government before we reached this point. We have been seeking the facts. The Government is in possession of the facts and it has knowledge of the sequence of events. It could table an official Government statement, which is what we have been pursuing since we started to investigate this matter. If we are talking about borrowing $4,000m, it seems to me to be somewhat absurd that we are asked to take some comfort from the fact that we have nearly been able to borrow $100m. Why was authority given to the Minister for Minerals and Energy to borrow $4,000m, for matters such as unemployment? </para>
          <para>That takes us back to the questions that were posed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> when he spoke to the motion. How are we to finance the Budget deficit in the economic situation in which we find ourselves this year? How are we to find the rest of the money that will be required for such purposes as the expected increase in unemployment, that were apparently authentic so far as the Government was concerned? Was the $4,000m required for some purpose of Government? Did the need for it arise from the fact that the Senate refused to pass the National Investment Fund Bill because we felt there was no protection for the savings of the Australian people in that Bill and in the purposes for which the Government wished to apply the money in the so-called national interest? Did these matters arise from that sequence of events? Has it been decided now by the Government that it would have been better to continue printing money than to have stumbled into this excursion into the international loan market which has revealed the Government&#39;s ineptitude? These things are the collective responsibility of government and should have been dealt with in that way. </para>
          <para>We have heard in the past few hours something of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacDonald</inline> and what he was reported to have said on television last night. Published in the &#39;Australian&#39; yesterday was the damaging document to the Government signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacDonald</inline> in which he quoted many of the facts that are in the Executive Council Minute tabled in the Senate today. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacDonald</inline> has been said to deny that he has an agency relationship with the Australian Government. It has not been answered yet whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacDonald</inline> denies that he wrote the letter which bears his signature over his company name, and whether he is purporting to be someone who is a representative of the Australian Government in the pursuit of loan moneys. </para>
          <para>Why did the Minister refer to the incidents relating to the loan borrowings as a storm in a teacup? If that is an example of the value judgment of this Government of this incident involving the breakdown between a departmental head and the ministry, and between government and public administration, it seems to me that the Government&#39;s relativities are somewhat awry. Do the Minister and the Government seriously suggest that there is no basis for the concern which has developed with regard to letters and documents which are in circulation? They are running around the world, and it is inescapable that they are running around the world, yet a simple assertion by this Government in a public announcement would destroy any letters which have no basis in fact and which are not the basis of some agency or commission relationship which may have been negotiated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor.</inline></para>
          <para>It seems to me that the unanswered questions are still the subject of concern, and the Opposition felt it was its responsibility to bring them before the Senate by way of a motion to debate a matter of urgency. Does the Government believe that attempts to borrow large sums of money outside Australia and outside established Treasury procedures will remain secret from the Australian people? Is it not understood that a simple telephone call on the international money market reveals what is happening all around the world on a particular day? Those honourable senators who sat on the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership and Control would have understood from the financial intermediaries who appeared before that Committee how sensitive the international money market is. Is it to be regarded as responsible that we bypass those parts of Government administration which have developed expertise in dealing on the international loan market? Why does the Government not make an official statement to refute the claims that have been emerging daily? Perhaps they are becoming distorted because there is no concrete statement in specific terms from the Australian Government. Until we get this sort of information, I believe it is despicable to use a Senate debate on a matter of urgency to set the stage to remove the head of the most important department in this country. </para>

I hoped that the honourable senator also would have pointed out that on the Public Accounts Committee we take great pride in taking a non-partisan cool look at the problem, at looking at the evidence, at times in camera where appropriate and in public where appropriate, and investigating the matter before the Committee and looking calmly and coolly at the facts. This is not what we are doing today. We are indulging in a traditional sordid political argument with adversaries on both sides and with people trying to win political points. This is not the way to look at this problem. The appropriate way to look at this problem is through an investigation by a committee, as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> has promised, and then for the Government to look at the findings of that committee and at the evidence that was produced to that committee to give those findings. There is a world of difference between what happens on the Public Accounts Committee and what is happening in this place today. </para>
          <para>Other members of the Government Party and I have awaited this debate with some interest. </para>
          <para class="block">Most of us have been surprised that it has taken so long to come on because of the claims and the posturings of members of the Opposition, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> about the mysterious things going on in the money market around the world, especially in the mysterious East, and mysterious eastern gentlemen involved in all sorts of shady deals. The first accusation that I came across seemed to be that the Government had some sort of agency arrangement with a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani. Mr Lynch</inline> asserted that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> had a criminal background. When it was shown that neither Scotland Yard nor the Treasury, nor, I understand, a leading New York bank, could find any evidence to support this assertion there was no back-down from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch.</inline> To my knowledge, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> has not apologised to the gentleman for the assertions he made. I must say that in view of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> &#39;s record the fact that the assertion is wrong and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> will not back down and will not apologise to someone about whom he has made accusations in this way does not surprise anybody on the Government side. </para>
          <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> found he was getting nowhere with this accusation he started to produce mysterious pieces of paper. They came from sources that he would not reveal. He would not submit them to authentication, and he would not guarantee himself that they were authentic. One of the documents claiming that the Government had an agency arrangement with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacDonald</inline> of a company called Dolmac Consultants has since been denied. From the Government side of the House it is really difficult to understand what are the motives behind the Opposition &#39;s campaign- this campaign that has consisted of unsubstantiated statements of denigration and innuendo. It is difficult to know what it is all about, unless it is just for sordid political gain. There are always people who will produce pieces of paper and push selective facts or selective tracts out to people for their own gain or for their own notoriety, and unfortunately there are always people in this place who will take them and use them for their own gain. They will always accept them. We have to five with this. </para>
          <para>I had hoped with other members on the Government side of the House that today we would have had some indications of the reasons for this episode from the arguments that were put forward by the Opposition. As with other urgency motions we have had in this place, we have had very little indication. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> have pointed out to members of the Opposition and to members on the Government side the obvious fact that the world has changed and that there has been a great capital flow from the traditional money markets of the world to the Middle East oil producers. I think the figure of $700,000m was quoted. It is obvious that many of the oil producing countries, many of which previously were unsophisticated in money matters, would use people from their own area, their own racial groups and their own religions to develop methods of handling this money and investing it. For example, I can remember that Saudi Arabia hired a Pakistani gentleman- a banker and a distinguished economist- to develop its treasury procedures and to develop its economy. </para>
          <para>It seems to me that it is also sensible that someone seeking funds from these areas should look to people who have had long experience in the area and who may even be of the same racial group as the people in the area or even sometimes of the same religion, to seek funds, to find out where these funds come from and to investigate whether arrangements can be made to borrow some of these funds- not to borrow the money for us but to investigate the sources of the funds. I can see nothing unusual in that and I can see nothing sinister in that. It was on that theme that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> started the argument which I think has been the one consistent argument used by the Opposition all afternoon. We have had all sorts of diversions. We have even had an interjection of a racial nature. But the basic argument that has run right through the speeches of members of the Opposition this afternoon has been that the Government has not used the traditional methods of seeking finance, that we have not used the Morgan Stanley group in New York, that we have had the temerity to change the practices of the past. I suppose some members of the Opposition will object to that merely from the approach of blind conservatism - </para>

          <para>If the furtive little epistles produced on television by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> and followed up by claims such as &#39;I cannot authenticate them. It is up to someone else to authenticate them&#39;, is the sort of evidence the Opposition is using to question the Government&#39;s motives, I would suggest that we could probably question the Opposition&#39;s motives.

The Opposition has to answer these questions. It is not for me to suggest that the Opposition is just protecting its traditional friends or that it is even protecting its traditional sources of income for itself. The questions have been asked of the Opposition. It now has to explain why it has indulged in this little episode and why it has gone along with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> and his little tricks, because the nature of the debate has changed. The Opposition has received answers to its questions from this side of the chamber. It now has to produce some answers to the questions as to why it has indulged in this sort of nonsense. </para>

            <para>- The picture is now quite clear. The Whitlam Government, faced with a major political scandal as a result of its carpetbagging around the world in search of loans, is seeking to create a whitewash for itself and a major diversion. It is quite clear that what is to happen is that the Treasury is to become a scapegoat and that the Secretary of the Treasury is to become the major scapegoat. It is well that the Senate and the people of Australia should understand and have clearly recorded the interjection by the Minister for Police and Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> during <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> &#39;s speech when he said: &#39;What if the whole Department is corrupt? &#39; The implication is there. </para>

              <para>- Those were his words. He said before that, in effect: &#39;If the house is wrong don&#39;t you pull down the whole house?&#39;. He implied that the Treasury is in fact corrupt. Indeed the only case that has been put forward today by the Government was put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland in what I regard as being one of the most despicable interventions I have seen. He brought forward a memorandum the author of which, in my view, will regret that he ever wrote it in a tittle, tattle way. The bringing forward of that document was a complete diversion and, in itself, a petty diversion at that. If that is the best argument that the Government can have in facing up to the charges laid against it, it will not get far. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Let me crystallise this matter. These are the questions that the Government must answer: Why, in the first place, did it decide to raise $4,000m, a figure quite unprecedented not only in Australian terms but in world terms? The total borrowings from overseas at any one time over the years collectively and current in Australia are of the order of about $ 1,000m to $ 1,500m. It is suggested that we were going to put on top of that amount $4,000m, a kind of figure which would have been grossly inflationary had it been achieved. We have been given no explanation, except a conflicting one- a clear statement by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> in Hansard that the loan was purely for energy purposes and a statement attached to the Executive Council minute to say that it was for far more general purposes. The reason for this conflict is not answered. </para>
          <para>Secondly, I ask: Why was not it a Cabinet decision? Why did it not emerge through Cabinet, as it was of major importance, absolutely major importance, and something that had never been done before in Australia. Why did it creep through into the Executive Council where it was considered by a handful of Ministers, including the Prime Minister? That question has not been answered. Why did it not go before the Australian Loan Council and get Loan Council approval, as has been the practice with all previous loans? That question has not been answered. Above everything, why was it decided for the first time in history to bypass the Treasury, to bypass all of the Treasury outlets around the world, and use those outlets, the proper authoritative outlets that are recognised for the raising of loans. Why was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> given the job of raising the loan when the loan was to be used for general purposes? Why was he given an open book? None of these questions have been answered. </para>
          <para>The Government has said that the onus of proof is on us. Let me put this to honourable senators opposite: A series of letters and a series of telexes have now been published throughout the world. A number of people when approached have confirmed that. Let us now put the onus back on the Government. The simple fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giok,</inline> a Belgian financier, has said that he had been offered a 1 per cent commission in connection with the proposed $4,000m loan to the Australian Government. </para>

              <para>- The onus now shifts to the Government because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giok,</inline> when approached, said: &#39;I have received such a letter and in such terms&#39;. The purported letter contains the normal letterhead of the Moscow Narodny </para>

          <para class="block">Bank. So the onus shifts to the Government. Two more telexes appeared this morning and perhaps the Government would like to respond to what I have to say. The spokesman for the Minister for Minerals and Energy when approached about the telexes said that they were probably genuine. He went on to say: &#39;But there was no backing or authority for them from the Australian Government&#39;. If it is said by the Government that they were probably genuine we have the circumstance that I raised with the Leader of the Government in the Senate this morning: The letters from Dolmac and from the Moscow Narodny Bank and the telexes are genuine or they are a fraud, or they are fraudulently uttered by the person who wrote them. They are genuine, they are a forgery or they are fraudulently uttered. We have in the case of the telexes- and the Leader of the Government smiles- a statement reported and not denied from the Department that they are probably genuine. We have a statement from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giok</inline> to the effect that he had such a letter. </para>
          <para>Now we come to Dolmac. The onus is on the Government to tell the financial circles of this world whether or not the Dolmac Consultants&#39; letter now circulating throughout the world as an alleged letter is a forgery or a fraud, or is authentic. That clearly is the onus which is on the Government. The onus goes far wider than this Parliament. All the financial houses of the world are interested to know whether in fact this particular financial house has the authority from this Government. Indeed, the Government must respond. Is it possible to believe that a responsible government would allow a whole host of people to run around the world alleging that they have mandates and letters of authority, or alleging that they are agents and have a commission, and not deny those claims? </para>
          <para>The most significant thing in this debate is that the Government has made no statement to the effect either that the Dolmac Consultants&#39; letter is a forgery or that it is fraudulently uttered. If it is fraudulently uttered, the signatory to that letter is in for serious legal trouble. It would be a gross uttered fraud if that letter is in fact a fraud. Of course, if the letter were forged, it would be equally so. But the real onus shifts to the Government for the very simple reason that the Government is saying here that nobody has such authority, yet it is not saying to the world that these letters are spurious. When I asked a question about this matter this morning the Minister ran away from it. It is utterly clear that the Government has a major case to answer. I come back to it: Why this enormous sum of $4,000m? Of all the Arab currency available in the world at any one time this loan is in the order of 8 per cent of the whole, which is quite impossible to chase, anyhow. </para>
          <para>This morning the Government admitted this gross disparity by claiming some credit for the fact that tomorrow it intends to announce that it has secured $ 100m worth of loans from America. Does it really believe that by securing a relatively modest amount of money- it is something which has been done many times before- that in any way proves anything about the security of a loan of $4,000m in a completely unorthodox, carpetbagging way. The Government has been very vocal in demanding that the letters and the facts be produced. But the Government will not do one thing; it will not produce the letter of accreditation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> Therefore it must be entirely suspect and remain so unless and until that letter comes forward. Why will the Government not produce that letter? I pressed the Minister this morning about this matter and he ran away from it again. He is very willing to bring forward and to table a snivelling little memo, a pimping little memo, because it suits his despicable purpose of trying to pin the blame on some departmental head who has rendered magnificent service to Australia and on a body, the Treasury, whose only sin in its eyes is that it has had the integrity to stand up to the Government and remind the Government that what it was doing was unorthodox and wrong. Because the Treasury has had the integrity and the courage to come forward and stand up to the Government, it is now to be punished. Now we are to have the most un-Australian and miserable sort of thing that you can have- the use of sneaking little memos to try to dob in somebody. </para>

              <para>-I thought that the <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poysers</inline> of this world would never have taken part in the most totally un-Australian of all activities, and that is dobbing in the other fellow, putting in your mate. What kind of mateship is that? The Government is building up a memo which it purports to be authoritative. Half of it is concerned with a formal meeting and the other half is concerned with informal asides, if in fact they are true. The best that the Government can do in the face of this situation is to come forward with what I regard to be something which is completely contemptible and completely unAustralian. The simple fact is that throughout the whole of Australia more and more people are coming forward and saying: &#39;We have such letters. They contain a mandate for action and for commission&#39;. The Government itself has not said that the letters are fraudulent or forgeries. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Indeed, the Department has said today that it believes that the telex is genuine. It has stated that it believes there are a couple more pieces of correspondence floating around the world which state that certain people act for the Australian Government, that those people are authorised to raise $3, 000m. Yet the Government itself says that it has no responsibility to respond to this. Of course, this is completely nonsensical. </para>
          <para>I have already received permission to have incorporated in Hansard copies of the 2 alleged letters. Indeed, one of those letters is now claimed to be true by the man to whom it was addressed. One of the letters is claimed to be true by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giok. Mr Giok</inline> has said that he had correspondence and instructions from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Macdonald. Mr MacDonald</inline> is the purported signatory of the other letter. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Ako</inline> in Switzerland, acting for the Moscow Narodny Bank, has also indicated this. So we have a fair authentication of one letter. It states that a loan of $4,000m was to be raised with a one per cent commission, that the man concerned was dealing with a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacDonald</inline> who is the purported signatory of the second letter and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Ako</inline> who is the addressee of the first letter, has also given verification. The authenticity of the letters themselves has been strengthened, plus the fact that it was agreed today that the telex is genuine. </para>
          <para>Now, what do we have? What we have now is quite clearly a picture of a series of documents circulating throughout this world and a number of people going around now saying that they represent the Australian Government and have authority to raise $4,000m and to receive one per cent commission. That is what is happening now. In reply, the Government says that nobody has such authority. The Government says: &#39;We appointed one man, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> but we did not give him any authority; we just gave him a letter of accreditation. He was not an agent and he was not getting a commission &#39;. </para>

            <para>- I am amazed at the attitude that has been adopted by the Opposition on the last day of this sessional period. At the request of the Opposition, for a period of 3 hours we have been debating a so-called motion of urgency, really whether the Government has answered questions in this present sessional period of Parliament. Opposition members have done this behind the weapon of an alleged failure of Ministers to answer their questions. Opposition senators have said: &#39;We have documents. They are behind our backs&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> used the phrase &#39;I have here 2 alleged letters. You are in the dock. You prove that you are innocent&#39;. That is the attitude that is being adopted by the Opposition. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If one had listened, as we have on the Government side, to the case that has been put forward by  speaker  after  speaker  from the Opposition, one would have realised that the Opposition&#39;s whole case has been based on hyperbole and hypothesis. Practically every sentence in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> &#39;s speech commenced with the preposition &#39;if. He said: &#39;If this letter is true&#39; or &#39;if this letter has been written&#39;. But not once did any member of the Opposition come forward with any document of any evidentiary value. I remind honourable senators that the motion to debate a matter of urgency is not a motion of lack of confidence in the Government; it is not a motion of censure of any Minister of the Crown; it is not a request for a commission of inquiry or anything of that nature; it is a motion to debate a matter of urgency which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .Cotton</inline> on behalf of the Liberal Party. When the  President  asked whether the motion was seconded every member of the Liberal Party in the chamber rose in his place to second the motion. </para>
          <para>What is the motion? This motion to debate a matter of urgency is brought on on the last day of this sessional period, and when a number of Bills have to be dealt with and debated constructively and at length in this chamber we are expected to discuss the failure of the Government, when questioned, to make full disclosure to Parliament regarding overseas loan transactions. The House of Representatives sat until this time last week. From, I suppose, March to the end of last week, question after question was asked by Opposition spokesmen of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns)</inline> and the Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor).</inline> No motion of lack of confidence in the Government has been moved in the House of Representatives as a result of any answer given by the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Prime Minister or the Minister for Minerals and Energy. No motion of censure of any Minister has been moved as a result of any answer given in the House of Representatives. The House of </para>
          <para class="block">Representatives has adjourned, and so the battle has transferred to the Senate this week. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline>as Leader of the Government in the Senate, as the Minister representing the Treasurer in the Senate, as the Minister representing the Prime Minister in the Senate, and as the Minister representing the Minister for Minerals and Energy in the Senate, has had to run the gauntlet of the whole of the Opposition&#39;s attack on this question this week. All questions asked have been qualified with an &#39;if. If the total time that was devoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> to answering questions on this matter this week were added up it would be at least an hour. Quite clearly on Tuesday, Wednesday and today <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> opened up everything that he had on behalf of the Government. </para>

              <para>-My friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> asks: &#39;Why did he not file the letters?&#39; Honourable senators opposite have made the accusation. They should produce the letters and then we will prove our innocence. The Leader of the Government already has described this debate that was brought on as a matter of urgency as a mere storm in a teacup and, frankly, having listened to the case this morning, so far as this Government is concerned, that storm has very much abated, if ever there was a storm. On the evidence that has been adduced from both sides in this debate today it appears that the stormclouds now are blowing very much towards the Opposition. The evidence that has come out in this debate, which now has taken nearly 3 hours, quite clearly is that in typical fashion the Opposition members- as has been proved over and over again in the <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> years they have been in Opposition- have acted on half-baked information and furphies, and by keeping on as they have on this occasion they have blown their gaff once again. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>These constant allegations now have been floating around for three or four months. There has been furphy after furphy. Because the Government has followed the normal arrangement of governments in seeking overseas borrowings, but perhaps because we have explored areas additional to the ordinary areas that are explored, the Opposition draws sinister inferences and makes smear attacks on people. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> who said something about Australia&#39;s lack of credit rating in the United States of America at present. The information now provided to me by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, on advice from </para>
          <para class="block">Treasury officials, is that Australia&#39;s credit rating in the United States is at an all time high. Both rating agencies rate Australia as a &#39;triple A&#39; borrower, which is the highest rating obtainable. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission is guided in its assessment of the rating of nations by these agencies. So another furphy is exploded. Despite what the Opposition has said, on the record of evidence available to the whole world, Australia&#39;s credit rating in the United States is at an all time high. </para>
          <para>Let us come back to this urgency motion. The Opposition says that there has been a failure on the part of the Government when questioned to make full disclosure in Parliament regarding overseas loan transactions. As I have said, the Government has supplied all the answers, the Opposition has supplied all the accusations, but it has supplied nothing with which to back up its accusations. Despite all that honourable senators opposite have said, they have not produced one tittle of evidence against any single person either in government or acting for or on behalf of government. All that they have done is prove to themselves that they are getting unsure, uncertain and poor information from one or twoperhaps three or four- people in the Public Service, people who try to make out to the Opposition that they know everything. All that really has come out is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> is literally roaming the world, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh&#39;s</inline> phrase, in an endeavour to find something that he can use as another smear weapon against people. </para>
          <para>Only last Tuesday night- 2 nights ago- the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> appeared on the national television program &#39;This Day Tonight&#39; and said on that program, which has a very high national rating, that he had letters proving a relationship between intermediaries nominated by the Australian Government, on the one hand, and a London based Iranian firm called Dolmac Consultants, on the other hand. Nothing was produced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> except words, hyperbole, hypothesis and accusation. No document was shown. There was merely a bald statement that he had letters- not one letter, not a document, but that he had letters- two or more of them, to prove a relationship between intermediaries nominated by the Australian Government and a London based Iranian firm, Dolmac Consultants. Last night TDT came on the air and again started to discuss the question that has been roaming around this Parliament and through the pages of the newspapers over the last 4 or 5 months- the question of the way the Australian Government was involving itself in international borrowings on the overseas loan markets. TDT came back to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> &#39;s accusations made the previous night. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finlay,</inline> the compere of the show, said amongst other things: </para>
          <para>Well, we&#39;ve just been talking to the managing director of that firm - </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline>having made that accusation, the next night <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finlay</inline> queried the accusation and went on the air and made the statement which I have quoted, not under the privilege of Parliament. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> wants to query <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finlay</inline> I suggest that he can do so by either going on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finlay</inline> &#39;s program or taking action against him in the courts of this country. Yet we have heard nothing more from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch.</inline> Opposition members continually make the charges. They are the accusers. They have produced no evidence. They drop phrases in now and again, such as someone having- and I use the phrase that they have used- &#39;a criminal record&#39;. To add to the element of drama that they have tried to build up over four, five or six months, they add an additional phrase and state that advice to this effect- that is, about a person having a criminal record- &#39;was given to the Government by Scotland Yard&#39;. I think my colleague, the Leader of the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> already has exploded that myth. </para>
          <para>As I have said, all of this mud-slinging has been going on for three or four months. It was first raised in the Melbourne &#39;Age &#39;, I think, in the middle of February of this year- 5 months ago. Now, 5 months after it first broke, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> produces 2 alleged letters written as long ago as, I think he said, 28 or 29 January. No one will know whether they are genuine letters until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> produces the letters, and no one can confirm or deny that they are genuine until he produces them. One must ask, if they are genuine letters, who extracted them from which files? </para>
          <para>I remind the Senate that we are not discussing a motion of lack of confidence in the Government; we are not discussing a motion of censure against any Minister; we are not discussing a motion calling for a committee or a commission of inquiry into the matter. We are merely discussing the failure- and I say the alleged failure, and wrongly alleged failure- of the Government, when questioned, to make full disclosure to Parliament regarding overseas loan transactions. I say that every answer that has been given by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and by the Minister for Minerals and Energy in another place and by the Leader of the Government in the Senate on behalf of the Government has been satisfactorily given. </para>

            <para>-The Special Minister of State <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland)</inline> has referred once again to the terms of the motion which has been brought before the Senate today by the Opposition. I refer to it once again. The Opposition has raised here for debate a very vital question; namely, the failure of the Government, when questioned, to make full disclosure to Parliament regarding overseas loan transactions. I probably do not need to remind the Senate that this matter involves attempts by this Government over the past 6 months to raise something of the order of 4,000m on the overseas money market. The Special Minister of State has said the Opposition, in raising this matter, is creating a storm in a teacup. That is a fairly good indication of the attitude this Government has taken all along to efforts made by the Opposition to find out what has been going on in this matter. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The first question on this matter was asked on 13 February this year- 4 months ago. I think it is perfectly obvious from today&#39;s debate that it is only as a result of questioning over that period and as a result of this matter having been raised for debate in the Senate today that we have been able to obtain some glimmer of the facts in relation to this vitally important matter. I am not satisfied- I am sure honourable senators on this side of the chamber are not satisfied- with the information which we have been given so far. To explain why we moved this motion I would like to read some of the early answers given by Ministers in relation to this matter. On 1 3 February the matter was first raised in another place. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> was asked this very simple question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Is the Government engaged in seeking massive overseas loan funds from the Middle East? If so, will he make a full explanation to the House? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline>replied: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I noticed a report concerning this matter in one metropolitan journal. Matters relating to the currency, loans and the commercial credit of the nation should be handled with the utmost discretion. I am acting accordingly. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was the answer. On 23 April <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline></para>
          <para>Did the Minister for Minerals and Energy receive authority from the Executive Council to borrow up to $4,000m overseas? </para>
          <para class="block">A number of other matters were raised. They related to the fact that the amount was reduced to $2,000m. This answer was given on 23 April: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The statement as to the amounts is correct. As I indicated to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on a former occasion, borrowing transactions are a matter of confidentiality and responsibility and will continue to be so treated. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He simply said that the statement as to the amounts was correct, not whether there was or was not an authority. I turn to the first answer given by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> in relation to this matter. That was on 20 May this year. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser asked the Prime Minister: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Can he inform the House whether the proposed $2 billion borrowing by the Minister for Minerals and Energy has the approval of the Australian Loan Counicl? If not, when will the Government seek approval of the Loan Council? What is the purpose of the loan? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Prime Minister replied: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The answer to the first question is no; to the second, if and when the loan is made; to the third, for matters related to energy. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">After all the efforts which have been made by the Opposition in another place and here over this period of 4 months, finally today we have, as a result of this motion being moved in the Senate, had tabled in the Senate, not by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt),</inline> as one might have expected, but by his colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, the actual Executive Council minute of 13 December 1974. For the whole period of 4 months the Government has been refusing to give details of it to the Parliament or to the public. When it is tabled, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> has very carefully and skilfully analysed, it is quite clear that this authority was a very much wider authority than had ever been suggested by the Government. It was for purposes very much wider and very much more detailed than that which the Prime Minister indicated on 20 May- for purposes relating to energy. It was a very wider purpose. I will refer to that again because I think the Prime Minister&#39;s credibility is now very gravely in question as a result of these proceedings. </para>
          <para>The explanatory memorandum attached to that Executive Council minute indicates that the Government needs immediate access to substantial sums of non-equity capital. It wanted immediate access for temporary purposes. Is the borrowing of money for matters related to energy projects- projects which would have lead times of years and which would have a life of decades- a temporary purpose? The Government stated it wanted such money for temporary purposes. The explanatory memorandum of the Executive Council minute states in part:  . . amongst other things to deal with exigencies arising out of the current world situation and the international energy crisis, to strengthen Australia&#39;s external financial position, to provide immediate protection for Australia in regard to supplies of minerals and energy and to deal with current and immediately foreseeable unemployment in Australia. </para>
          <para class="block">We have, 1 believe, as a result of the debate today finally extracted from the Government some very important information about this matter. The only way in which we were able to extract such information was by raising this matter of public importance today. We attempted to extract this information over months by questions, asked of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> the Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> and the previous Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns).</inline> As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland stated, we have attempted during this week to extract this information by directing questions to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> the Leader of the Government in this place. Until today we have been continually fobbed off and misled in one form or another, over a period of 4 months, by this Government. We have finally, as I have said, as a result of the pressure of this debate some glimmer of the Government&#39;s activities in this matter. </para>
          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> made quite clear, the Opposition is by no means satisfied with the answers we have had either at question time today or in this debate and it is the intention of the Opposition to continue to pursue this matter until we get the whole truth from the Government. It has been a story of cover-up- a story of one cover-up after another, not only by Ministers including the Minister for Minerals and Energy, but also by the Prime Minister himself. Not only has there been a cover-up but there has been grave misleading of the Parliament- of the House of Representatives and the Senate- during this period. We intend to pursue this matter to the bitter end. We will continue to maintain that stance. The Opposition will use a number of tactics which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has already indicated. The Government need not think that it will be let off the string by the Opposition in relation to this vital matter, the importance of which has been clearly indicated time and time again by the Opposition and which is well understood by the electorate. The issues in this debate, I think, are now exhausted. I move: </para>

              <para>-The Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty entered into force on 5 March 1970 and has now been in force for 5 years. In accordance with the provisions of Article 8(3) of the Treaty, a conference of parties and signatories to the Treaty was held in Geneva for 4 weeks during May to review the operation of the Treaty. The declaration adopted by the conference in its final session on 30 May and upon which a consensus of all those present was achieved is tabled herewith for the information of honourable senators. The conference considered a wide range of issues relating to the role of this Treaty in encouraging the peaceful application of nuclear energy as well as its contribution to peace and security throughout the world. The declaration testifies to the comprehensive nature of the discussions, to which the Australian delegation made a significant contribution. A number of important initiatives for further enhancing this Treaty were suggested at the conference. These will require the careful consideration of the Government and will provide a firm basis for further consultations between States to ensure the continued success of the Treaty and the further reinforcement of the international non-proliferation regime. </para>

        <para class="block">On 1 August 1974 the House of Representatives affirmed the decision taken by that House on 31 May 1973 that the Australian Parliament join with the parliaments of the States in the Constitutional Convention that has been established to review the Australian Constitution. It further determined that of the delegation from the Australian Parliament of 16 members, ten should be members of the House of Representatives, comprising 5 members of the Australian Labor Party, 3 members of the Liberal Party of Australia and 2 members of the then Australian </para>
        <para class="block">Country Party. A similar motion was moved in the Senate on the same day by the then AttorneyGeneral which proposed that 6 members of the Senate should be members of the delegation, being 3 members of the Australian Labor Party, one member of the Liberal Party of Australia, one member of the then Australian Country Party, and the Leader of the Liberal Movement. That resolution was similar to the one passed by the Senate on 31 May 1973, which determined that the 6 members of the Senate comprise 3 members of the Australian Labor Party, one member of the Liberal Party of Australia, one member of the Australian Country Party and one member of the Australian Democratic Labor Party. On 15 August 1974 the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate moved a new resolution, the effect of which was to delete from the delegation the Leader of the Liberal Movement and substitute a second member of the Liberal Party. Both the motion of the Attorney-General and that of the Leader of the Opposition were negatived on tied votes on 2 1 September 1 974. </para>
        <para>Yesterday the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> together with the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> and the Honourable Ian Sinclair, attended a meeting of the executive committee of the Australian Constitutional Convention that had been called to consider an agenda for the next full meeting of the Convention and to establish a date and place for the holding of that meeting. As a result of yesterday&#39;s discussions the basis of a draft agenda was determined. This is to include a constitutional amendment for the interchange of powers between the Australian and State parliaments- a much needed constitutional amendment; consideration of the constitutional position of local government; several important references of power to the Australian Parliament, and a number of matters of importance to the Territories. It was further determined that the next meeting of the Convention should be held in Melbourne, commencing on 24 September 1975. It is therefore important that the Australian Parliament&#39;s delegation to the Convention should be determined without further delay. </para>
        <para>In submitting this motion there are 2 particular points that I wish to emphasise. Firstly, the motion now before the Senate is on all fours with that passed by the Senate on 31 May 1973. It simply substitutes the Leader of the Liberal Movement for a member of the Australian Democratic Labor Party, a Party that is no longer represented in this chamber. The representation of the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia and the National </para>
        <para class="block">Country Party is unchanged. Secondly, the Leader of the Liberal Movement, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall, is recognised by this Senate as the leader of a party. This was accepted by the Senate when the senator took his seat following the election in May 1 974. Indeed, a glance at our list of senators and the daily Hansard of the Senate, for example, will show honourable senators that he is the Leader of the Liberal Movement. I commend the motion to the Senate. </para>

          <para>- I do not dispute the accuracy of the dates and the terms of the motions referred to by the Minister for Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt),</inline> but I would dispute some of the other things which he has said. He said that this motion is on all fours with the one which was carried by the Senate in 1 973. It is really not on all fours because at that time the Australian Democratic Labor Party was represented in this place by 5 senators. At that time the Australian Labor Party had 26 senators and the Liberal-Country Party had, I think, 26 senators. There were 3 independent senators, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Negus, Senator Turnbull</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley.</inline> The composition of the Senate at that time was totally different from the present composition. Therefore, any attempt to draw any sort of a comparison betwen those 2 situations is, I think, wrong. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>When this matter was last before the Senate the Opposition asked: Why should the Labor Party with 29 senators have 3 representatives on the delegation and the Liberal-Country Party with 29 senators have only 2 representatives. We thought that if the Government was so anxious to have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall,</inline> as the Leader of his Party, as a member of the delegation it should reduce by one the number of its own representatives, not the number of the Opposition&#39;s representatives. Since that time the numbers in this place have changed. The Government has but 28 senators; the Liberal-Country Party has 30 senators; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> sits as Leader of his Party, as he did before; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunton</inline> has become a member of this place, as an Independent. Yet the Government still thinks that with 28 senators it should have 3 representatives on the delegation and that the Liberal-Country Party with 30 senators should have 2 representatives. Again I say to the Government: If it is genuine about this matter it should make provision for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> in its own numbers on the delegation. I say this not in any personal sense; I do not bear any personal animosity. It is a matter of equity between the parties. </para>
        <para>On Thursday of last week, the last day on which the House of Representatives sat, there was moved in this place a motion which was designed to set up a Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House. In many ways that was an unusual motion as to determining the composition of the proposed Committee. I suppose it was promoted on the basis that this was something which affected the Parliament. Honourable senators will recall that the composition there set out was a committee of twelve, six from each House. Leaving aside the equality between the Houses, how the six from each House was to be determined was very interesting. In that motion it was said that three were to be nominated by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and three by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> As to the senators, three were to be nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> and three by me, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. That proposition, which was to reflect the will of the Parliament, took no account of the National Country Party. It gave it no representation. </para>

            <para>-Do not jump too quickly. It made no provision for direct representation of the National Country Party, as does this motion, either here or in the House of Representatives.

            <para>-I try to think that people ought not to be any worse than I am. I will put it that way. Is that kinder? We must look at the whole history of this Constitutional Convention. It was quite obvious from the day it started that the Prime Minister intended to make certain that it did not work. I do not think he was ever particularly enamoured of the whole idea. It is well known- nobody is under any illusion- that the Prime Minister would not care if the Constitutional Convention died and disappeared. Again it is no secret that he has been under a great deal of pressure from his colleagues of the Labor Party in State parliaments in the postTerrigal atmosphere for the Labor Party to be taking a little more interest in this situation and as a result I understand that a delegation saw him recently. </para>

        <para>The Senate well knows that last night the Leader of the Government in the Senate asked for leave to give notice of this motion. That leave was readily granted by the Opposition on the simple basis that if the Leader of the Government wants leave it always ought to be given, other than in exceptional circumstances which I cannot contemplate happening. I know that basically the same courtesy has been extended to me. I had a suspicion that the Prime Minister would not have minded if we had refused leave last night so that notice would have had to be given today and then there would have been no opportunity for this matter to come on for discussion. I also have not much doubt that the matter having come on the Prime Minister would not be terribly upset if the result was the same as last time. Then the Prime Minister would be able to say to the Premiers Conference next week: &#39;I wanted to go to the Constitutional Convention but those old dinosaurs in the Senate who are supposed to represent the States prevented the national Parliament from being represented &#39;. I do not think that anybody in State politics would be fooled by that operation. </para>
        <para>In any event, the amendments I propose to move will have the same result although they are different in form because of the way this motion has come before the Senate. I would hope that this time I will have more success than I had last time. I do not know whether I can move the amendments in one motion, by leave, rather than to have two, three or four divisions about whether certain words should be left out and whether certain other words should be inserted, as well as all the other things. </para>

            <para>-I thank the Senate. The amendment is quite simple. It does not quarrel with the composition as between the 2 Houses. All it states is that the 6 members of the Senate comprise 3 Government supporters, 2 senators from my Party and one from the National Country Party of Australia. We propose this merely as a matter of equity as between the parties. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> feels that he is being disadvantaged I suggest that he ask the Government to make one of its positions available to him. I do not think we need to go into the statistics of the percentage of votes polled by each of the parties at the last election. After all, I thought this was supposed to be a parliamentary delegation to the Constitutional Convention. I would have thought that we would have followed the precedent established in relation to the committee that inquired into the new and permanent parliament house- equal numbers a side, nominated by the Leaders. </para>

I should not like to say that I would be personally disappointed if the vote on this motion went against my inclusion in the delegation. That of course would relieve me from a great deal of study and application to the subject matter. But I know that the 23 per cent of the non-Labor voters in South Australia who voted for me at the Senate elections would be disappointed. They would feel that some unfair - </para>

            <para>-The 23 per cent of the non-Labor voters who voted for my Party at the Senate election- that is the statistic if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> would like to do his homework- would be very disappointed if I were excluded. I think that is the basis of the matter. Why has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> proposed the motion? He said that he has done it on a non-personal basis and I hope that is the case. But I feel that he thinks there is some political question in South Australia attached to this matter. He may attribute motives to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> but I think it is fair enough to say that he sees some political result in South Australia. I wonder whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> is mistaken, that the people who think about politics in South Australia would feel that he is taking some unfair advantage of this corner of the chamber which includes 2 people who are not members of the National Country Party of Australia or the Liberal Party of Australia, especially as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> has pointed out that his Party did not have any additional representation because of the previous motion on this matter that went through the House. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> is now looking to use brute force in this House to alter the position dramatically in his Party&#39;s favour, in fact to double- to put up by 100 per cent- the representation of his Party from this Senate at the Constitutional Convention. </para>

            <para>- I think that is another matter. Electorally, it may well be that he is doing me a favour by pointing out that he will take his opposition, politically, to any lengths to try to make an impact. I believe that will rebound in South Australia despite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren&#39;s</inline> hopeful stirring interjection which is without foundation. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers&#39;</inline> view prevails there will be a significant independent and small party viewpoint which will be unrepresented at the Constitutional Convention. I do not think it is represented in any way from the lower House. It could not be. There is no nonmajor party representation from the lower House. Therefore all minor parties, smaller partieshowever they are measured- and independents will be excluded. So as far as the Federal Parliament is concerned the Constitutional Convention will be a big party machine deal. </para>

            <para>- I do not know the answer to that question. The South Australian House is sitting at the moment. I do not know whether it has made any fresh arrangement. I quite honestly cannot answer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> I hope they have not made any changes in South Australia because my colleague and State leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robin</inline> Millhouse, is recognised as a very keen and able constitutional student and lawyer who applies himself well to matters relating to the Federal Constitution. I think that despite the problem in the upper House with the party to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> belongs and, of course, the opposition of the Liberal Party in the lower House, the South Australian Parliament is likely to retain the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Millhouse</inline> because of the value he contributes to the Convention. Without in any way arguing this in a personal way, I think it is wrong for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> to try to use brute force to double his party&#39;s involvement from the Senate at the Constitutional Convention and to exclude all federal non-major party representation at that Convention. </para>

            <para>-I think it is a fair point that any political party ought to be represented there if it is represented in the Parliament. Previously the Australian Democratic Labor Party was to be included as part of the representation, but as it no longer exists in the Parliament it is fitting that the Liberal Movement should be represented. It is not so much a question of equity as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has suggested. The Liberal Party is represented and in the House of Representatives where the numbers position is the opposite to what it is here, the Government did not take advantage of those numbers to give itself undue or unequal representation. It could have done so had it wanted to use its numbers which appears to be the intention of the Opposition in this place. It will simply use its numbers without concern for the justice of what it is doing. I believe that if the motion which has been put forward by the Government is accepted, then we will have proper representation by all political parties which are represented here. I feel it would be wrong and not in the spirit of being represented at that Convention if one of the smaller parties was to be deliberately excluded. The Democratic Labor Party at one stage certainly had 5 honourable senators sitting here. But the fact that it was five in number is not the important point. The important point is that it existed in the Parliament. The Liberal Movement as a party, much to the regret, I know, of the Liberal Party exists here and there is a possibility that it will exist for quite some time. </para>

            <para>-That will be a matter of judgment. Considering the sorts of problems which the Liberal Movement has created for the honourable senator&#39;s party in South Australia, I think the honourable senator will have a greater desire than the Labor Party to see the destruction of the Liberal Movement, certainly in that State. It is suggested that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> has not been greatly interested in the Constitutional Convention, but it is interesting to note that only this week he attended the meeting of the Executive Committee of that Convention which I think was held in Brisbane. He is the first Prime Minister ever to attend the Executive Committee of the Convention. That hardly suggests that he is antagonistic to or is not greatly interested in the working of the Convention. The proper course is to carry the motion. I hope that the Senate, in particular the Independent senators, will recognise the rights of the smaller political Party and will support the Government motion. The acceptance of the motion would give us the fairest and most equitable representation at the Convention. </para>

The Government is in power and the Liberal Party, the National Country Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall &#39;s Party and I, as an Independent, are on the Opposition benches. That position can be altered at any time. If there is an alteration I am certain that we would find the Government advancing a different viewpoint. If the LiberalCountry Party Opposition were in government we would find that the Australian Labor Party- I think rightly- would require to have the same number of representatives. In the other place the numbers are not so very different and there is equal representation from that place on the Convention. </para>

        <para>As was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> the matter which came down in respect of the new parliament house made provision for the Opposition and the Government to have equal representation. I would like to think that if this amendment were carried it would be carried in a different form so as to make provision for representation by 3 members from the Government and 3 members from the Opposition. If the motion were carried in that form I would like to think that the Opposition would give consideration to accepting the outstanding qualifications of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall and perhaps including him amongst its representatives.

With all deference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunton</inline> &#39;s removal, perhaps, from the power base of the Liberal Movement, a splinter party is what we are not.

He said that the Liberal Movement should have representation on the delegation. However, the Liberal Movement already has representation at the Convention in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Millhouse,</inline> the leader of that relatively minor Party in South Australia. I dare not use the word &#39;splinter&#39; because I know how offensive it would be to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall. However, I do remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> that 33 and one-third per cent of his Party&#39;s parliamentary representation will be in attendance at the Convention. If we give him a place it will mean that 50 per cent of his Party&#39;s parliamentary representation will be at the Convention. </para>

        <para>I want to indicate to the Senate and to the South Australian electorate that in no way are we denigrating <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> by moving this amendment. We think it is fair to insist that the Liberal and National Country parties have a greater voice on this delegation. The Leader of the Government in the Senate referred to the Democratic Labor Party. The Democratic Labor Party is a Party of a quite different character to that of the Liberal Movement and it did contest elections in every State. As such it had some claim to be represented on the delegation from this Parliament. Not only that, it had four or five members in the Senate which is quite different from the single voice from the Liberal Movement we have bleating here occasionally. I repeat that this is not an action by the Opposition in denigration of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall;</inline> it is merely a fair request and I believe we ought to insist on it. </para>

            <para>- I believe that the debate on the motion for the second reading of this Bill, the Customs Bill and the Customs Tariff Validation Bill terminated last evening with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim&#39;s</inline> speech. I am now replying to the comments made in that debate. I have very little to say. In his contribution to the debate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> asked for some assurance from me. I thought that his speech was a most peculiar one to be made by a member of the National Country Party of Australia, in that he expressed concern about the protection of secondary industries. The Minister for Police and Customs still has the right to prevent dumping. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">He has that right under the existing legislation. I can give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> the assurance that he sought from me. Such powers exist already and it is not the intention of the Government to permit the dumping of goods in Australia to the detriment of Australian industry. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline>likewise made a good contribution to the debate. It was the sort of contribution that we have heard for the last 20 years from every free protectionist in Australia. I believe that it would have done justice to the honourable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kelly),</inline> from whom we have heard so often. The only difference on this occasion is that there was some criticism of the Government&#39;s 25 per cent across-the-board tariff reduction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland explained the situation in that respect yesterday. The desired result in this respect has failed to be achieved because instead of a cheaper commodity being available to the consumer, the situation has developed in which the sale price of a commodity has been determined by what the market will bear, and the market has been able to bear imported goods at the same price as Australian goods, which has permitted a profit of up to 400 per cent to be made by the distributors in Australia of imported goods. Of course the distributors did not reduce the price. Although they made profits they did not make any reduction in the price of their goods. I thank the Opposition for supporting the 3 Bills and for the expedition with which it has allowed them to pass through the Senate. </para>

            <para>-The Ship Construction Bounty Bill 1975 gives effect to measures announced by the Minister for Secondary Industry and Minister for Supply on 18 December 1973. The Bill aims to provide assistance for continuing development of a rational and efficient ship building industry in Australia. Protection against prospective import competition is therefore built into it, while providing purchasers with opportunities to source their requirements overseas under certain conditions. Current assistance is provided for under section 47 of the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Act 1956, as amended. Under that Act Australia agrees to purchase a vessel from the shipowner on completion and sell it back at the same price, less the amount of subsidy to be provided. The level and mode of assistance have been reviewed by the Tariff Board from time to time, and the last dme it was reviewed was in June 1971. Annual payments in this area of expenditure have risen from about $2m in 1947 to $3Om in 1974. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Bounty provided for under this legislation is calculated in a manner similar to that in other bounty legislation. The Bill brings the method of calculation into Une with that used in regard to other bounty assistance to manufacturers in other areas. The bounty is payable on vessels constructed in Australia, in registered shipyards. It is payable on vessels of 150 gross construction tons or more and on fishing vessels 2 1 metres or more in length, where these vessels are to be used in Australian waters or for use by Australian flag operators in international trade. The bounty is also payable on modifications carried out in Australia on existing vessels where the cost involved in the modification exceeds $500,000. There is provision for a pro rata recapture bounty arrangement which is spelt out in the second reading speech of the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland),</inline> but I do not feel I need once more to spell that out. The cost of certain items, such as the purchase of designs and miscellaneous stores, may be excluded. The Bill also provided for registration of premises, and those provisions are similar to those in the Metal Working Machine Tools Bounty Act 1972 and the Agricultural Tractors Bounty Act 1973. </para>
          <para>The Opposition did not oppose this Bill in the House of Representatives and it does not oppose it in this chamber. During the intervening period between the Bill being considered in the House of Representatives and being considered by ourselves, I have received a long representation by way of telex from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Butler</inline> of the State Dockyard who was acting, I believe, on behalf of a number of shipbuilders. They have raised various areas of difficulty and probable concern that they feel might perhaps arise. I have been through the points they raise in some detail. The Opposition does not propose to move any amendments at this stage because we did not take that course in the House of Representatives. I have conferred with the Minister for Labor and Immigration. I understand that he has the same information that I have. It is my intention to check that with him. I ask him to give an undertaking in his reply to take care of those various areas of concern. If it is shown in due course that these areas of concern need rectification or change, I ask him to give an undertaking also that he will bring the matter forward. I ask the Minister to be so kind as to discuss the matter with me in order that I may perhaps facilitate the process. </para>

            <para>- The Senate is discussing the Ship Construction Bounty Bill 1975 which authorises the payment of a bounty to shipbuilders who are engaged in the construction or modification, at registered premises, of vessels for use in Australian waters or for use in the overseas trade as vessels registered in Australia. This Bill is of particular interest to me, as it is to the Australian shipbuilding industry as a whole. I have a particular interest in it because it affects, of course, the shipbuilding activities of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd at Whyalla, upon which that community depends very much for its economic well being. There are a number of aspects of this Bill which perhaps ought to be discussed in fairly great detail. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> who led for the Opposition in the debate on this Bill has indicated that he has had representations from shipbuilders and has taken note of their concern, so I will not elaborate to any great extent in that respect. The matter of the date of the keel laying or the date of the beginning of construction which is mentioned in the Bill has apparently been dealt with fairly adequately in the legislation. The Bill, as tabled in the Senate, really makes no specific mention of a keel laying date but refers to the commencement of construction. This seems to overcome some difficulties which have worried shipbuilders. </para>
          <para>Another point which is not mentioned in the representations that were made to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> but which has come to mind following a study of this Bill relates to clause 6 of the Bill. This clause confers wide discretionary powers on the Minister whereby he may disregard any part of a vessel price for the purpose of determining bounty. The original policy statement of December 1973 enumerated several specific items. For example, it mentioned that insurance would be excluded from price for determination of the bounty. However, the last paragraph of clause 6(1) is not specific and could be interpreted to mean that the Minister may adjust the bounty on the basis of factors such as the vessel design features or selection of particular items of machinery or equipment. For example, the Minister may consider that a vessel needs only 6 hatches instead of 7 hatches or that the speed of 16 knots for the vessel is unnecessary and that 15 knots would be sufficient. On the basis of such judgments it seems that the Minister would have the power to reduce the bounty price and hence the bounty itself. If the discretionary powers are likely to be used in this way it will add to the uncertainty already existing in the minds of owners and builders in the whole matter of bounty determination. </para>
          <para>I think that the shipbuilders misgivings about the policy and the legislation may be summarised by saying that there is nothing to encourage capital investment in new facilities. Such investment is badly needed if the industry is to achieve the efficiencies needed to offset the effects of reducing bounty in the face of world competition. Inducements to shipowners in the form of credit facilities and accelerated depreciation have been suggested but apparently the Government has rejected these proposals. Incentives to the shipbuilders themselves could be in the form of an investment allowance for taxation purposes, or perhaps special loans. But again, these proposals have not been favourably considered by the Government. I think the Government has rebutted this with the argument that the shipbuilding industry should receive no concessions that are not available to manufacturing industry generally. </para>
          <para>Another matter on which I would like the Minister&#39;s comment is the case of a shipbuilder in Australia who may build a vessel for an Australian enterprise. What would happen if that enterprise, through unforeseen circumstances, no longer required such a vessel? I understand that there is a problem here if the shipbuilder sells the vessel at a loss. I believe that the recapture of the bounty in such a case should be waived. I support the Bill. </para>

            <para>-The Ship Construction Bounty Bill has been framed after close co-operation with the industry. Various suggestions have been put which have been embodied in the legislation. The doubts that have been expressed in the telex from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Butler</inline> of the State Dockyard to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> adverted have also been conveyed to me. I took the trouble to discuss them with the Department of Manufacturing Industry. They were actually forwarded to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Henderson,</inline> who is the Executive Director of the Australian Shipbuilders Association. The Department discussed these points in detail with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Henderson</inline> and he said that he would be satisfied and the industry would be satisfied if the points were answered in a letter from the Department, and the Department has undertaken to do that. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not think the points that are raised are matters of great substance. Rather they are administrative matters. For example doubt is expressed as to the specific action of the bounty. I assure the Senate that the Minister would not act capriciously in a way that is feared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Butler.</inline> There is also a comment on the variation of the bounty price. As this refers to clause 13 subclause 2 I assure the Senate that the working of that sub-clause will be examined in the light of experience. It does not seem to raise any immediate problem. The intention is that the existing procedures covering variation of the bounty, taking account of cost escalation will continue to apply, but if it turns out by experience that some amendment is necessary I will give an undertaking that the matter will be considered as indeed will any other amendments needed in the light of experience. This goes also to the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop.</inline> If it turns out that the fear he has of what might happen in the event of unforeseeable circumstances is well founded we will be ready to consider any necessary amendments to the Bill. We do not claim that it is a perfect Bill. We see that it is naturally a Bill which will require to be tested by trial and error. We are not inflexible about the Bill. Our attitude is: Let us see how it works, and if it turns out to have flaws we will be open to suggestions for improvement. </para>

            <para>- The Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Bill 1975 is a composite measure with two main sets of proposals. One set of proposals relates to an adjustment of the terms of loans made under clause 12 (4) of the AlburyWodonga Area Development Agreement and enables the deferment of repayment by New South Wales and Victoria of loans made to the growth areas where the growth centre program is generating insufficient income to cover repayments. The Opposition appreciates the legal doubts that arose as to whether or not the arrangements infringed the provisions of the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act. We appreciate the need for that part of this particular Bill. We also appreciate the provisions in the Bill to adjust other terms and conditions of loans made to the States. We are interested that the opportunity now exists for loans of longer than the previous maximum period to become available- longer than 40 years for sewerage works and longer than 30 years for other kinds of work. I reiterate the interest of the shadow Minister in the House of Representatives who said that the Senate should be kept fully informed of the conditions of these loans as and when they are made. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The second part of this measure, however, provides&#39;- I use the inverted commas because we are not quite sure whether it is in the form of loans or grants- funds for instance for flood mitigation works in Brisbane. I would like to address just a few remarks to that subject. I remind the Senate that, following the floods which occured on Australia Day 1974, a decision was reached that flood mitigation works were necessary in Brisbane. According to the &#39;Courier Mail&#39; of 6 December 1974, the Government intimated that it would give up to $lm to help with these flood mitigation works. I further remind the Senate that the project in question is one to raise the level of a dam on Breakfast Creek by some 20 feet to provide some flood mitigation for Breakfast Creek and Enoggera Creek. The cost of this project, which has been let to Thiess Brothers Pty Ltd, is $2,812,000. I simply remind the Senate that on other flood mitigation projects- for example, the one relating to Seymour- the Federal Government has generally taken up to 40 per cent of the cost. Forty per cent of the cost of this project would be $1,250,000. I will be interested to know whether the grant of $450,000 provided for in this Bill represents the entire contribution of the Australian Government or whether it is the first of several contributions to bring its total contribution up to 40 percent of$2.8m </para>
          <para>From reading the second reading speech of the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh)</inline> at no stage was it clear whether the assistance was to be a loan or a grant. There is a very big difference. For example, when we discussed the sewerage grants program last year we were talking about money being available at the long term bond rate which, according to the latest figures I have, is 9.5 per cent. It would be gratifying to know that this money is being given to Queensland as a grant. I hope that the Minister will advise us of that. My understanding is that no final agreement has yet been signed with the Queensland Government. That Government is very concerned that there should be an agreement. It is possible that this will be in the form of a grant. Opposition Senators have no desire to hold up this legislation. We wish the Bill a speedy passage. We hope that the Minister can fill us in on the very few details which we have requested. </para>

            <para>- There are more than legal doubts now about the growth centres which are the subject of this Bill. On 10 June there appeared in the &#39;Australian&#39; newspaper a Press report of a departmental inquiry commissioned by the Federal Department of Urban and Regional Development. I have not yet had time to read the report of that inquiry, if one is available and I suppose it is available. But one cannot doubt the validity of the newspaper report, on a general scan of it. It raises tremendous questions as to the propriety of having these growth centres at all. It raises the question of whether there is room in Australia for more than one growth centre.

              <para>- Well, it impinges on growth centres in the sense that it is very closely allied with them. It is part of the sense of widening development of population centres in which the Government is involved. Before the Government gets too deeply involved in spreading its money widely in spheres which are being greatly questioned by independent advisers I suggest it should look carefully at its programs. It should look particularly carefully at Monarto, which is not concerned with this Bill I admit but is subject to very severe questioning by authorities who are advising the South Australian Government. The Government should look at its wide range of expenditures in the general spreading of Australia&#39;s population to make sure that it is not making the vast mistakes there that it is making in other directions. </para>

It was not. That is a mistatement in the book.

So it is not an official departmental document. While Professor Logan is entitled to his views and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall is entitled to his views, the Government policy is- and it was a promise in two policy speeches- that we will develop those centres in Australia to erase the intolerable situation that exists in the outer metropolitan and inner metropolitan areas of the big capital dues.

            <para>- The Income Tax Assessment Bill 1975 attends to various matters in the Income Tax Assessment Act. It was not objected to in the House of Representatives and it is not objected to here. It seeks to amend the tax law so that after independence Papua New Guinea will be treated as a separate country for Australian tax purposes. The Bill ends the operation of special provisions applying to Papua New Guinea. Income that is derived from Papua New Guinea by Australian residents will be treated as income from a source outside Australia. Exception to this case is in the form of double tax relief to apply after independence. Salary or wages of Australians working in Papua New Guinea under various attachments or contracts to that Government will be exempt from Australian tax where the Papua New Guinea Government taxes the income. The rate of withholding tax on dividends paid to Papua New Guinea residents will remain at half the general rate of 30 per cent, despite the fact that there is no comprehensive double tax agreement with Papua New Guinea. That is a concession by Australia to the emerging independent nation. It is normal to have double tax agreements in those cases. I think the Government is correct in making that concession because no doubt such an agreement will come to pass. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We have a very special relationship with that nation which we have brought to a state of adulthood, if I might use that term. The changes are to be synchronised with the independence of Papua New Guinea, whenever that comes about. There are problems in that regard, as we know, but they are foreign affairs problems, not problems with the taxation law. People in receipt of pensions from Australia or Papua New Guinea will be taxed only in the country of residence. Exemptions from Australian tax on compensation and allowances paid under the employment security scheme are only to the extent that the amount is of a kind prescribed by the Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) (Termination of Employment) Regulations. They are the amounts which are paid to expatriate officers of the Public Service of Papua New Guinea at the end of their service there. That seems to be a fairly tidy and sensible arrangement and one which is consistent with our relationship with that nation. </para>
          <para>Another clause provides exemption from withholding tax for interest paid by the Australian Industry Development Corporation in respect of loans raised overseas. A very good explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the Bill, which is the normal practice with the Treasury and the Taxation Office. This matter is referred to at page 33 of the explanatory memorandum. It is one to which we do not take exception. It is a straightforward operation. Therefore I think we would find ourselves quite able to agree with it, as we were in the House of Representatives. The Bill provides also for accelerated income tax deductions for depreciation, as announced on 9 December 1974. It is designed to stimulate investment in manufacturing and primary production plant. It is a measure with which we find ourselves in agreement. Taxpayers will be entitled to claim depreciation deductions on eligible plant at twice the rate normally applied. The increased rates so taken up will apply until the cost of the eligible plant is written off. Plant which was previously eligible for the now abolished investment allowances and is first installed and ready for use during the 12 months ending June 1975 is eligible for that concession. Taxpayers may elect to forego accelerated depreciation allowances if they so wish. This is referred to in the explanatory memorandum, in reference to clause 20, and, in more detail, in reference to clauses 23 and 24. </para>
          <para>I should like to say that obviously this concession, under this legislation, expires in June 1975. Expenditure that is contemplated by manufacturers or primary producers on and after 1 July 1975 will not be eligible for this concession, as I read it, unless the Government in its wisdom decides, in its next Budget, to extend the concession in the future to cover new plant and equipment purchased by manufacturers and primary producers. I think that it is a wise provision. I think that the comments we have been making here about the need for investment in Australia and the need for people to obtain new plant and equipment are completely correct. This may, perhaps, facilitate the process. Indeed, one certainly hopes it will do so. </para>
          <para>The Bill also provides for the previous decision to dispense with the collection of the instalment of company tax in February 1975 to be set aside for the present. It was proposed that companies would pay tax quarterly. At the same time that that legislation was introduced there was a fairly massive credit squeeze, a drop in profitability and the problem of inflation. Many companies found themselves so short of cash because of inflation, low profitability and difficulties in obtaining credit that they were unable to pay their income tax bills as the Government thought they would be able to do. That position has been moderated to some extent. I imagine that it is only a temporary moderation. Perhaps it will emerge again at some future time. When it does emerge again- if it does- we will consider it on its merits or demerits. It will be the subject of substantial argument at that time. </para>
          <para>This Bill also repeals the provisions contained in the 1974-75 Budget to ascribe minimum values for income tax purposes to cars available for private use of employees. This repeal was part of a general package announced by the Government on 28 January this year to try to stimulate employment in the motor car manufacturing industry by getting people, once again, to start buying motor cars. There was the great problem of accumulated stocks. This created the further problem of a great number of people being put out of work because manufacturers could no longer continue to finance expansion of the industry. As I said at that time, this relief, plus the temporary reductions in sales tax and a few other measures, produced a temporary relief in the situation. Whilst we agreed with this proposal and thought that it was a wise step to take, because at the time it was introduced it stopped many companies from buying motor cars for their employees, it depressed the market very substantially. It also made it very difficult for many individuals in their own personal financial situations to calculate their income tax. The Opposition believes that before very long the motor car industry, as such, will be heading for trouble. It believes that the number of new motor car purchases will diminish once again, and the problem of unemployment will arise. </para>
          <para>As the Opposition has stated, if these problems are going to arise in the motor car industry the Opposition hopes that the Government will come along early with ideas to try to improve the situation so that we can have time to consider our position in relation to this question. </para>
          <para>The Bill also amends the income tax law to ensure that the allowances that are paid under the National Employment and Training scheme will be taxable. This is referred to on page 38 of the explanatory memorandum. It refers to clause 50 and states: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. allowances paid under the NEAT System are to be subject to tax and are to come under the pay-as-you-earn tax instalment system. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">There is more than that but I do not need to refer to it at greater length. As honourable senators will see, the Opposition does not oppose these measures, and in some cases regards them as both wise and sensible. </para>

              <para>- In December last year. I made urgent inquiries about this matter last week. I found, of course, what I ought to have known, that the benefits were tied up in this major Bill affecting the situation in Papua New Guinea. This matter has caused some concern among people who had been encouraged to buy large amounts of farm machinery. Of course, the policies which were announced in December were designed to give this encouragement. It seems to me, from the experience of these 2 taxation consultants who had advised their customers of their belief that the depreciation allowance would not apply, that some publicity will need to be given to the passage of this Bill. Not, of course, that the matter would not be fixed eventually. I am sure that in the end, after some confusion in accounting procedures, the position would be clarified. But it might save inefficiency and some doubt in the minds of some people who have bought machinery on the strength of the earlier announcement, if the Department could perhaps make known to all consultants that the changes are now in effect and are law. . </para>

            <para>-The Bill before the Senate is the States Grants (Beef Industry) Bill 1975. On behalf of the Opposition, I indicate that we are in full support of this Bill which proposes an additional loan to the industry of some $ 19.6m to be matched by the States on a dollar for dollar basis, and fortunately, on this occasion, at a much lower rate of interest than the previous loan to the beef industry. The States will receive these moneys in the proportions of $10m to Queensland, $5m to New South Wales, $2m to Victoria, $1,500,000 to South Australia, $800,000 to Western Australia and $300,000 to Tasmania. We support this Bill for the obvious reason that this extremely great primary industry is in dire straits at this time and indeed it is regrettably in a deteriorating condition still in the Australian scene. We believe that the Government must show the responsibility that it is now showing with respect to the beef industry in Australia, because that industry surely, amongst all the industries in this country, has in fact a great potential. There can be little doubt that in the ultimate and we hope in the not too far distant future, the industry will round the corner and once again become as significant in the economy of this country as it has been in the past. Consequently, I believe it is an industry which investment by the Government is not only proper but is certainly necessary. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that in the course of this debate I should make one or two brief references to the industry. I think it proper that the Senate should be aware of the extreme circumstances that exist and why they exist. There is in this industry a circumstance in which the price of the product has fallen by some 60 per cent to 80 per cent in 12 months. Regrettably, in that same industry the cost structure has increased by somewhere in the vicinity of 25 per cent. Those 2 elements of a lowering and still lowering price factor and a spiralling cost factor have contributed most significantly to the circumstances in which the industry finds itself. </para>
          <para>There are one or two areas to which I believe the Government quite properly should turn its attention. Unemployment in the beef producing industry is such that money should be made available in order to keep employees of that industry operating on the properties on which they have been living and operating over the years. There are 2 very good reasons to provide that money. In the first place, not only would it prevent their impending unemployment but it would maintain within the industry the skill and knowledge that is represented by those employees, and it would retain them in the communitiesin many cases in far flung areas of Australia- of which they and their families are significant members. The other reason for the provision of assistance obviously is that by making it possible to retain these people in the beef producing area of the industry, the capacity of the industry to keep and develop its assets at this particularly dangerous period of its existence would be maintained. Indeed, that asset is a great asset of the Australian people and the Australian economy. By retaining these skilled people in the industry, at least in a depressed period, it becomes possible to keep and develop that asset. </para>
          <para>Perhaps greater attention could have been paid in the industry to the programs for eradication of disease, and I believe that here in particular there arises the question of tuberculosis and brucellosis, which campaigns are running down at a time when, hopefully, they should have been increased. An increase in the campaigns at this stage could have been done quite obviously at lesser cost to the Government because of the unfortunately low price of the animals concerned. Secondly, it would have been of great value to take advantage of these campaigns at this time because as the industry climbs out of its trough it would have found itself with a much healthier and much better herd than otherwise may have been the case. I believe also that the Government should consider most seriously the question of suspending the 1.6c per lb export tax on beef. While that obviously would not alter the price of beef, it would in real terms change the net return to the grower. Export incentives in this industry have been curtailed; transport charges, fuel bunkering charges, freight and so forth have all risen dramatically, and unfortunately these are in the main a product of this Government&#39;s economic policies across a very wide field. </para>
          <para>Briefly, then, I indicate that the Opposition supports this Bill. The money is very necessary for the industry. It is an industry with a tremendous significance to the Australian economy and ultimately it will climb out of the trough it is in. But the Opposition does insist that there are positive measures that could and should be taken in addition to the provision of these loan moneys. So we would urge the Government to look at all these other possibilities of improving an industry which is in dire straits at the moment and which unquestionably will ultimately fulfil its potential in this economy. </para>

            <para>- I would not anticipate that the Opposition would oppose this legislation because it is the result of deliberations between the Australian Government and the State governments. In fact the amounts sought by all the States are being provided on a matching basis by the Australian Government at 4 per cent interest. I am sure that no other industry in Australia, possibly with the exception of the dairying industry, is receiving such favourable consideration as the beef industry is getting at the present time. It is all very well to nominate a string of other measures that the Government ought to take but there is a limit to what any government can do or should be expected to do. I know that there are such things as meat inspection levies that the industry is paying and there is also the brucellosis eradication campaign, but I do hope that the measures that are being taken by the Government are recognised and not drowned in suggestions of what else might be done. This arrangement, as I said, is a joint arrangement with the States and I believe the industry generally is quite satisfied with the performance of all the governments, both State and Federal, in respect of the assistance being given. The future for the beef industry in the long term remains good and I have no doubt that despite the downturn in this industry at the present time those producers who are properly established in the industry will again see a return to the buoyant conditions that we have witnessed over the last four or five years. </para>

            <para>- Again on behalf of the Opposition I indicate our firm support for these Wool Tax Bills. These Bills implement the proposal for a 250c per kilo reserve price for the coming 1975-76 season. They refer to the 5 per cent levy paid by producers to the market support fund and to the 2% per cent levy imposed for promotion and research purposes. The Bills also refer to the collection of those levies from all the sellers and handlers of wool whether they are inside or outside the auction system. It is most important that this legislation should come through this Parliament because the wool industry is of great significance in the Australian scene. The industry incidentally has been climbing out of one of its worst troughs. In this industry we have seen the base price for wool move from the 250c limit to 275c a few weeks ago. We have seen the trade purchasing 98 per cent and 99 per cent of the wool coming before it. These are superb signs of an industry, which probably more than any other is basic to the total balance of the rural economy, climbing out of yet another of its troughs. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that all people involved in this industry, all Australians, and certainly the Government, should be aware of the dangers of floating uncertainties in the context of an industry which is so basic and which, in all probability, is once again reaching a level of security, certainty and stability. Only a few weeks ago a kite was floated suggesting that the base price might be 200c. </para>
          <para class="block">This followed long delay in announcing the base price. The consternation of the producer through to the processor, the manufacturer and the retailer was intense all around the world. It was fortunate that that circumstance was not allowed to continue and that Caucus was able on that occasion to over-rule the Cabinet decision. If there is one thing that this industry must have in order to achieve and retain stability it is confidence. That confidence was severely shaken on that occasion. What a situation we would have had in this country if by such an action we literally had sold out to the eastern and western European users of wool by writing down the base price by some 50c a kilo. </para>
          <para>I do not want to delay the Senate&#39;s discussion of this Bill because we of the Opposition support it for excellent reasons. However I want to make one or two references to matters in the industry. The people of Australia, the taxpayers, from time to time hear stories of handouts to the great wool industry and of how the taxpayers are carrying it. I believe we should look at the industry very briefly in that context. People should be aware that in the last 12 months this industry, although not in as dire straits as the beef industry perhaps, has suffered a pretty serious crisis. In a period of 12 months it had seen the price of its product fall by some 65c a kilo while at the same time it was faced with an increase in its cost structure of not less than 37 per cent due to various economic policies that bear extremely heavily on the Australian wool industry. </para>
          <para>I want to refer once again to the necessity to erase the view that this great industry is heavily dependent on the Austraiian taxpayers. On the contrary, the moneys that support this industry are in the nature of loan moneys. They are provided as a commercial venture and carry an 1 1 per cent interest rate. As security for those moneys there is a substantial stockpile of wool in the hands of the Australian Wool Corporation. Those moneys are not subject to any great risk. More importantly still, people should realise that the producers themselves contribute 5 per cent to a market support fund of some $50m in round figures. This fund provides the moneys necessary for interest payments and handling charges. Indeed, it can be called on in the first instance to recover any losses by the Corporation. Moreover, by means of a direct <inline font-style="italic">2V*</inline> per cent levy on gross return the industry contributes money for promotion and research within the wool trade. These moneys, the 7% per cent of gross takings, as was indicated as a result of a question in this place by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> recently, are moneys which are never received by the Australian wool producer, yet on which he pays commission. That is a question at which in the future some real inquiry will be directed. </para>
          <para>We support these Bills fully because we are aware of the absolute necessity for a basic stability in this industry which is more referable to the total balance of the rural scene than probably any other industry. It is in the wool industry that Australia produces the most and the best. Indeed, to quote the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Patterson</inline> back in the days when the Australian Wool Commission was being formed to give an indication of his view of the wool industry: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The wool industry, without a shadow of doubt, is the most efficient export industry Australia has had since it was settled by white men. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is a remarkably fine credential coming from a spokesman from the Australian Labor Party. We support this legislation and we trust that the dismay and uncertainty that has come across, and hopefully drifted away from, this great industry will never be allowed to arise again. </para>

              <para>- I am going to. I shall make a comparison which may interest <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> quite considerably. In fact I shall make it a little sooner than I had intended. It is interesting to see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> is substantially blaming the Government for what he alleges to be a significant depression in Australian agriculture. As a couple of very well known agricultural economists remarked in a book which they published recently- the economists being Doctors Schapper and Mauldon- many of the beliefs pertaining to agriculture are often flatly contradicted by the facts, and the apparent belief of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> is one of those beliefs. The facts are that the anticipated net farm income, estimated by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, in real terms for the financial year 1974-75 is 20 per cent higher than it was in 1971-72. The significance of those years, of course, is that 1 97 1 -72 was the last full year of Liberal-Country Party Government. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> wishes to suggest that the Labor Government is totally or substantially responsible for what he sees as a significant depression in agriculture today perhaps he might have some explanation to offer as to why this income was 20 per cent less in real terms in the last year that his Party was in government? </para>

          <para>The purpose of this Bill <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> has explained accurately, the major feature of course being to continue a 5 per cent levy on gross wool proceeds to provide a capital fund in association with the maintenance of a fixed seasonal floor price. A couple of weeks ago this reserve price issue provided the setting for a most reprehensible exhibition of synthetic indignity or hypocrisy by the right honourable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> and the honourable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> who are the Leader and  Deputy  Leader respectively of the National Country Party of Australia in the other place. These 2 great poseurs who lead a Party which was in Government for more than 20 years, for much of which time they were senior Ministers in the coalition government and during which time they consistently refused to hold any seasonal floor price, have the audacity to castigate this Government which has the courage to do what they failed to do for 23 years. These honourable members pose and posture about the damage which they allege would be done to the wool industry if this Government failed to maintain a marketing policy which they for more than 2 decades refused to implement. The villainy and infamy was compounded by a most vicious, unfounded and typically inaccurate personal attack on the Minister for Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> launched by the greatest of all poseurs in the National Country Party, the honourable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> while on This Day Tonight&#39; on the evening of 26 May. On this program <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> stated among many other things: </para>
          <quote>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The honourable member was cut off by an interjection. Of course the decision to which he referred was clearly the then prevailing belief that the floor price of wool would be reduced to 200c per kilo. </para>
          <para>One could quibble about the accuracy of that $177m assessment which seems to be a fairly precise figure when we are dealing with such a nebulous concept. Far more importantly, if we accept at face value that, as the  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party said, it would cost the community $177m if price support were withdrawn from the wool market, I wonder what was the cost to the community of the 20-odd years which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair&#39;s</inline> Party was in government and during which time it provided no price support at all. I would love to have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> sitting opposite me so that I could put that question to him. As he is not here I would welcome an answer from some of his colleagues in his Party or in the other coalition Party. It seems to me that if it cost $177m in one year then a fairly reasonable assessment of the total cost to the community of the 20-odd years of inertia of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair&#39;s</inline> Party would be in the vicinity of 4 billion dollars. The Opposition may not accept that estimate. I accept that it is fallible. It seems to me to be a reasonable conclusion from the assumptions and assertions which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> has presented. </para>
          <para>The reason why the honourable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> and the honourable member for New England have lately taken to launching most vicious and unfounded attacks on the Minister for Agriculture is that they are beginning to realise that their credibility in the farming community is being eroded. They are terrified that the present Minister for Agriculture is being regarded, even by farmers, as a better Minister for Agriculture than either of those 2 honourable members was. Nearly everyone outside farming has always known that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> is a better Minister for Agriculture than either of them. With regard to the wool industry decision of a couple of weeks ago, I came across an article in the &#39;Chronicle&#39; which is a rural weekly publication in South Australia. From my reading of it and from information supplied to me by South Australian colleagues I understand it is far removed from being a radical left-wing journal. In fact, it is a typically conservative rural weekly paper. It contains a column which is written by a person who I understand is an active farmer. Certainly he is not a member of my Party nor, I believe, does he support it at election times. He writes under the pen name Victoria. In the issue of 6 June Victoria wrote an article describing the scenes on 26 May following the Caucus decision on the reserve price. He stated: </para>

          <para>The chronology of this matter begins, of course, with the Cabinet decision being made on 23 May. Having due regard for the size of this year&#39;s deficit, for worries about next year&#39;s deficit and for the uncertainty of the wool market- no doubt spurred on by the continuous campaign and the righteous exhortations of members of the Opposition in this chamber and in the other place to reduce Government spending and to cut the size of the Government deficit- the Cabinet made a decision to reduce the floor price. As anyone who has a minimum level of political literacy knows, in the Labor Party all Cabinet decisions must be referred to Caucus. Finally, the decison was due to have been made by Caucus on the following Tuesday. </para>
          <para>The House of Representatives sat on the Monday. We witnessed the disgusting spectacle of these two great poseurs, the honourable member for Richmond and the honourable member for New England, who claim to have been overwhelmingly concerned with the welfare of wool growers and the wool market, attempting to make the Government, and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> in particular, commit themselves to an irrevocable statement that the reserve price would not be set at 250c and that the Caucus would not amend the Cabinet&#39;s original decision. In the hope of getting a bit of cheap political mileage these poseurs did everything they possibly could to prevent an amendment to .the Cabinet decision with regard to the maintenance of the reserve price at 250c. On 27 May the Caucus meeting was held and the decision was taken to maintain the reserve price. I shall not keep the Senate much longer, but it is worth noting - </para>

          <para>Let us go back 4 years. In May 1 97 1 , ironically enough the same month as the decision was made this year, the Wool Corporation, as it was then known- its name was changed later- was operating what was euphemistically described by the then Minister for Primary Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> as a potholing operation. It was not holding a fixed seasonal reserve price, of course, because the Country Party used to say that above all we must not interfere with the free flow of wool on to the market. The Corporation was performing this potholing operation, following the market all over the place and doing all the things which the National Country Party now says is quite intolerable for us to contemplate doing. It was following the market all around the place, buying a bit of wool. At that time I think that the Government had outlaid $30m in advances or had guaranteed advances of $30m from private banks, as against the $3 50m which this Government has provided by direct appropriation. </para>
          <para>The then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon,</inline> was interviewed about this matter and, amongst other things, he said that the Government would have to review the finances of the Wool Corporation in that coming season. He did not say what he meant by &#39;review&#39; but the inference was quite clear- the Government would have to see whether it could responsibly continue to guarantee moneys to the Wool Corporation for the purchase of wool in a very depressed market, a much more depressed market than it is now. In May 1971, at one sale greasy wool was sold for an average price of 23c a lb, which is about 40 per cent of the current level. Despite what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> said I do not recall the Leader or the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party, who have been posing and posturing on this issue over the last couple of weeks, then demanding that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> make a firm and unequivocal statement that the Government would stand behind the Corporation for a full 12 months and maintain a seasonal price, as they were demanding that the Prime Minister should do a couple of weeks ago. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, the attempts by the Leader and Deputy Leader of the National Country Party to undermine and destabilise the wool market did not cease even with the Caucus decision and the Press statement by the Minister for Agriculture. They kept up this campaign for a full week, demanding that the Prime Minister make an unequivocal statement that the further reserve price would be held. Never mind how unnecessary that was, never mind that the responsible Minister had made such a statement on behalf the Government, they said that the Prime Minister had to say so and that until he did no one could be sure that the Government really meant what it said. What possible reason could there have been for attempting to continually destabilise the market, other than their long-standing and permanent ambition to gain a bit of cheap political mileage? Anyway, they finally got what they demanded, and it should satisfy even the National Country Party. On &#39;National Farming News&#39; on Thursday, 5 June, John Parker asked the Prime Minister this question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Prime Minister, will the Government definitely stand behind the reserve price of 250c in the wool market? </para>

            <para>- in reply- The Opposition is not opposing this legislation. It is enthusiastically supporting it, as it did the previous Bill which came before the Senate, and for that reason I do not wish to elaborate any of the aspects of the Bill. However, I wish to compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> for highlighting a very important point, that is, that it was the previous Government with a then Country Party Minister for Primary Industry that refused to take the steps that this Government was prepared to take to support the wool industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> who appears to be trying to interrupt me, would know nothing about this matter. He would know no more about it than I did when I started as Minister for Agriculture. I admit that, but at least I know something about it now. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline>commented about what it cost the wool industry when the Government allegedly decided to reduce the floor price. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> is quite right. If that argument is used let us try to calculate what it cost the wool industry in all the years that the Country Party and its friends in the </para>
          <para class="block">Liberal Party refused to put in a floor price for wool. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> quite rightly says that it would involve thousands of millions of dollars worth of Australian wool that was sent overseas at give away prices by the Liberal-Country Party Government. That is all history now. </para>
          <para>I take up the point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott.</inline> I shall make my point as strongly as I possibly can. He said that we must do nothing to shake the confidence of the world buying trade. How true that is. But who are the guilty people? Only last week Messrs Fraser, Sinclair and Anthony were doing their best to undermine the confidence of the wool trade and the wool buyers overseas by their continual spurious remarks about the Government&#39;s decision, even after the Government had clearly made a decision that the floor price would be 250c. They continually harped on the proposition that the Government did not really mean what it decided because the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> had said nothing. These are the guilty men. If any confidence has been taken away from the wool trade it has been taken away by people like Fraser, Sinclair and Anthony and nobody else. I am sure that the wool growers realise the extent to which this Government is prepared to stand behind them, and this legislation does exactly that. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition welcomes the introduction of the Dairy Produce Bill, basically for the reason that the reconstitution of the Dairy Produce Board was something that the Opposition had in mind when there was a change of Government. I must say that I and, I think, most of the dairy industry welcome the reconstitution. I think it will give additional emphasis and additional strength in a number of ways  to  the Board as it will be reconstituted in a way that will make it more effective and provide it with an opportunity to grapple with the problems that are now facing the industry and that have been facing the industry for a long time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Just before I move on to the reconstitution of the Board as a Corporation and one or two of the matters associated with that, I think it would be appropriate if I were to pay a tribute at this point to the  Various  people who have constituted the former Dairy Produce Board over the last 50 years or so for the work they have done. They have gone through some periods of extreme difficulty. I think that they have produced a particularly fine record for the industry. They, together with the industry. have realised for a long time that there have been certain drawbacks and there still are certain drawbacks within the powers that they have had. Hence they have been willing to see a reconstituted body. The former Board is now to be called the Australian Dairy Corporation. The reconstitution will in fact result in a reduction in the number of members of the organisation from thirteen to eleven. </para>
          <para>As pointed out by the Minister for Agriculture in his second reading speech, the Corporation will consist of 3 members who will be representing the dairy farmers, 3 members who will be representing the manufacturers, 2 members who will have special qualifications, one representative of the employees and a Government nominee. It will have an independent chairman. I think the only part of that aspect that has been the subject of any debate or discussion is the view in some sections of the industry that perhaps there may have been some case for a greater representation from the primary industry side- in other words, the dairy industry. But I suppose one can quite logically argue mathematically that three-elevenths is better than the previous position of three-thirteenths. I assume from the reaction by the Minister that he is quite happy with that mathematical calculation. </para>
          <para>There are some problems that the industry will have to look at in the future. Some of them have been with us for a long time; some of them are still arising in different ways. But perhaps we should look for a few minutes at the intention concerning what the Corporation is to do. We may realise from doing that that the Corporation, as it will be known, will be more effective. The first power that will be given to the Corporation is one of a regulatory nature. It will enable the Corporation to make assessments on the amount of the product from the industry that is needed for Australian consumption and the amount that is needed for sale overseas. We do not see any great difference in this respect, except that there will be a strengthening of the powers available to the Corporation. </para>
          <para>The second and probably most important power is the monopoly trading power. In other words the Corporation will be given the right to trade exclusively in the products of the dairy industry. Changes have taken place in the world demand for the products of the dairy industry, particularly with the entry of the United Kingdom into the European Economic Community. Of course, only last week there was a reaffirmation of that fact. That very large market used to be available to the dairy farmers and dairy industry of Australia but it is no longer available except in exceptional circumstances. Those circumstances probably are not foreseeable at this point. So I think there is a need in this area. I believe that these trading powers will help to strengthen the Australian Dairy Corporation to achieve what it is hoped will be achieved. The other purpose of the Bill, of course, is purely one that concerns the borrowing powers of the Corporation. We can see that there is a dramatic need for this. </para>
          <para>I mentioned that there are a number of problems still associated with the industry at which the industry and the Corporation, which will be at the head or the board of control of the industry, will have to look. I shall take a moment or two to enumerate them for the sake of record. As I have just indicated, there are many problems awaiting the new body. One is the increase in margarine quotas which perhaps is predictable in view of what has been happening in this field for many years. This is a problem that will increasingly worry the dairy industry. Although I do not say that I personally accept the argument that the margarine industry is or can be basically an Australian industry, I believe that we have to learn to live with it. In fact, one dairy factory in my own area is currently working on a blend of margarine and butter. Therefore I think that factory and a number of other people in the industry are accepting margarine, reluctantly though this may be. </para>
          <para>Perhaps one of the other problems that has been associated with the industry for a long time is getting what the industry accepts or thinks is a realistic price for its product. On two or three occasions in recent months a case has been put to the Prices Justification Tribunal for an increase in price. On one occasion the application was withdrawn. Subsequently there have been 2 very small increases in the price of basic dairy products, namely, butter and cheese. But I believe that the big problem, if we look at this matter objectively, is that of price. We have to realise that if the price of butter over the last 10 years had kept pace with rises in the average weekly wage its present price on the retail market would be something in the vicinity of $ 1.30 per lb. This, of course, is a very high price and is probably unrealistic in today&#39;s economic situation. But it is not a price that is unrealistic when one considers whether people were eating more or less butter 10, 12 or 15 years ago. In fact, butter consumption has dropped during that period up to 1975. As I have said, if the price of butter had kept pace with the average weekly wage it would now sell at $1.30 per lb. While this is a mathematical calculation, I believe that the industry will not push for such an increase. But I also believe that people have to realise that the time of cheap food has passed. They can no longer expect people in the dairy industry, particularly at the production level, to work very long hours, 7 days a week for 8, 9 or 10 months of the year for something less than actual wages. </para>
          <para>We have only to look through some of the numerous statistical records to see that dairy farmers in the main have had a pretty difficult time. Admittedly the dairy industry is the most effective, I suppose one could say, in this field in regard to stability of income. But it is not of much comfort for the people in the industry if the stable income is to be at a level that is too low to provide sufficient for them to live on and to pay their way. This problem was discussed on Tuesday of this week when the Senate was debating war service land settlement legislation. Many people have had to deal with this problem for a long time. Because things move so quickly it is not always possible for the individual, the Government or anyone else who wishes to do something to help or to correct the situation, to catch up in the short term. </para>
          <para>Another problem which is with us all the time- it is one I mentioned a few moments ago- is related to the sale of the product on the overseas market. In general terms the Australian dairying industry sells about 60 per cent of its total product on the overseas market. I refer to the manufactured side. Of course, the general narrowing of market availability is making it increasingly difficult for the new Corporation to find the conditions in which we can work and show a profit, and thus be of encouragement to the industry so that industry will be maintained at a viable and active level. The problem of viability today is one which is concerned not only with the question of price but also with the question of the availability of market so that there can be within the industry the diversification that is so sorely needed and, unfortunately, which is so terribly costly at the capital level on the manufacturing side. </para>
          <para>I think we all agree that the Dairy Adjustment Bill which was passed by the Parliament last year proved of tremendous assistance to the people who could take advantage of it. I do not think anybody would say that that is not so. But the big advantage of the legislation is that it is not as effective as it could be. It is a very effective piece of legislation and it provides for a very effective plan for those people who can make use of it, but the assistance which it provided was not as widespread as were previous forms of assistance- and does not necessarily mean that I am of the opinion that they were the answer, either. The legislation is not as effective as it should be, and for obvious reasons it is not possible to make it as effective as it should be. At the time when the legislation was introduced a tremendous evolution had taken place in the industry and a very large percentage of the dairying industry at that time had changed over from the production of cream to milk production. Most, although certainly not all, also changed over to refrigerated storage. </para>
          <para>Another thing that has had a marked effect on the dairying industry was mentioned earlier by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> in another debate when we were talking about assistance to the beef industry. I refer to the unfortunate fall in the demand for this type of beef- it is usually referred to in the industry as chopper cow meat- on the world market. It took a very severe pounding when prices fell. Because its price was the lowest in the original schedule of prices, it still has the lowest price and it took the greatest beating. It was, and has been for many years, particularly during the time when prices improved to a reasonably high level, a very valuable extra source of income to the dairying industry. The unwanted cows from the dairy herd, the cattle that were sometimes reared in conjunction with the dairy herd, all helped to augment and improve the income of the industry. Admittedly an income is still available, but at a very much reduced level. It does not now provide the advantage of increasing the overall income to any great or marked extent. So we see that there are still some problems in the industry. </para>
          <para>Another problem which I think is going to create a tremendous amount of work for the industry in the not too distant future is concerned with the situation which will arise in relation to the equalisation of prices for dairying industry products. Last year equalisation support dropped to 80 per cent of what it had been. As we look around the various States we see that some States now no longer wish to be involved in this particular aspect of pricing. I think the reason for that is fairly obvious. Three or four of the States of Australia are now consuming States and produce only enough of the product for their own needs. That does not help the 2 major producing States of Tasmania and Victoria. I think that anything that is done to destroy equalisation as we know it is going to be to the eventual detriment of the industry and possibly of Australia. The industry must be kept, as far as is possible by encouragement, by means of assistance from corporate boards and by means of other help, in as viable and healthy a state as is possible. </para>
          <para>I know that during the last few months thousands of words have been spoken on many occasions about the problems associated with rural industry. It is a soundly based industry. It is an industry in which for a long time a lot of people have been able to make a reasonable living. However, there are not very many rich dairy farmers, particularly at the ordinary or average level. </para>
          <para>The other aspect of the dairy industry that is constantly causing trouble and probably will remain with us is the tremendous capital cost in the manufacturing side. We must realise that because of market demands there is a need for very heavy capitalisation of costs in that side of the industry. The capability to diversify on the manufacturing side of the industry is a matter that increasingly creates a problem for the cooperatives and the various other manufacturing sides of the industry that are privately owned. This was one of the problems associated, as we saw a few months ago, with the Murray Goulburn Co-operative and the Kraft organisation in regard to equalisation. </para>
          <para>I turn to the Bill itself. There is only one clause in the Bill to which I do not necessarily object but which causes me a little concern. I refer to clause 6 of the Dairy Produce Bill which proposes to insert a new section 13A, paragraph (c) of which reads: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. the Corporation may- </para>
              <list type="loweralpha">

                  <para>subject to the approval of the Minister, on its own behalf or in collaboration with any other person, authority or association of persons, take, or  arange  for the taking of, any action in Australia or elsewhere that, in the opinion of the Corporation is likely- </para>
                </item>
                <item label="(i)">
                  <para>to lead to the improvement of the quality of dairy produce or the prevention of deterioration, before or during transport from Australia, of dairy produce; </para>
                </item>
              </list>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">I think we can assume from the attitude that has been taken by boards, etc., in the past that an objective and reasonable attitude will be taken by this Corporation towards the problems associated with the industry. </para>
          <para>A subject that is increasingly causing concern to the industry both at the manufacturing and at the producing level is the increased use of pesticides and weedicides. So I would think that one of the problems that will have to be watched by the Corporation in the interpretation of that clause is that no overt action is taken which will be detrimental to the industry, at least at the production level. We know from past experience what careless use of either pesticides or weedicides can have at the manufacturing level when very large quantities of the finished product can be returned or rejected by the country in which the produce is to be sold or, alternatively, at the point at which the manufacture takes place. With these thoughts, as I indicated before, the Opposition accepts these Bills. We welcome them. We congratulate the Government for bringing to fruition thoughts that were in the mind of the Opposition prior to 1 972. We wish the Bills a speedy passage. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-To speak at any length in this debate at this hour of the night so late in what has been a rather heavy session of the Parliament would be almost akin to a dairy farmer being pulled away from his evening meal after a hard day&#39;s work to go to assist a cow that is calving, to help a cow that has milk fever or something like that. Therefore, it is not my intention to speak at any length. As has been said already, the proposals before the Senate tonight will set up an Australian Dairy Corporation to replace what has been for many years the old Dairy Produce Board. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bessell</inline> mentioned, the new Corporation will have a membership of eleven. I think that the industry must surely be very pleased with the attitude that the Government has taken in regard to representation on the new Corporation of dairy farmers themselves. Whereas in the past the producers were entitled to only 3 representatives on a board of thirteen, on the new Corporation the dairy farmers have an entitlement to 3 members out of eleven which, in effect, increases the dairy farmer representation on the Corporation. As I have said, I think the Minister for Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> is to be congratulated for his endeavours in that field. I have no doubt that he was under a great deal of pressure from the industry, as he would be from all other industries at the time of revamping any statutory body, to place more people from all camps on that body. In this instance however he has, I think, been very wise and, because of the diversification of the industry in Australia, has retained the dairy farmers&#39; strength on the proposed Corporation at three, which is, as I have said, a greater proportion than it was under the previous Act. </para>
          <para>The Bill also increases the trading powers of the Corporation. Within the industry over the last decade both at farmer level and at farmer body level the question of marketing has become a rather topical issue. Perhaps it may be said belatedly that the industry is moving into this field; and thanks be to the Minister that that is the case. It is an area, I believe, where to a large extent the industry has fallen by the wayside. Let us hope that with the appointment of specialist people to the proposed Corporation the Corporation can now catch up with what it may have been lacking in the past. </para>
          <para>I noticed in one of this morning&#39;s newspapers that the Board had moved into the Middle East and obtained a market in Iran. On a visit that I was privileged to make into that area some 18 months ago I was informed by the Iranian Minister for Trade that dairy produce was one commodity that the Iranian Government was in search of. We were told that the Iranian Government was prepared to do deals on a long term basis- 5, 10, 15 or even 20 years- and money was no object. To me this type of deal is the ideal situation ibr all primary produce boards or corporations, provided we can guarantee some form of supply over periods and have an assured market when the goods are produced. This is certainly much better than the old catchascatchcan situation which prevailed with a great deal of our produce in times past. </para>
          <para>The proposals we are debating tonight are the second major effort by the Labor Governmentwhich is so often described as being antiruralsince it came to office to revamp the dairy industry. Previous proposals allowed for the broadening of the marginal dairy farm reconstruction scheme and granted interest free loans to dairy farmers to assist in the switch-over from water cooled or canned milk to refrigerated bulk milk vats. I know that there has been a great demand for this money right across Australia and even in my own State where, I believed, demand would not be as great as it would be in some of the warmer climates. However, in my own region alone it is anticipated that perhaps some 1 700 to 2000 dairy farmers will be applying for funds to switch over. I think that endeavours like this by the Government and by the Minister must surely lay somewhat to rest the hoary claim of the Labor Party&#39;s being anti-rural. If we have a look at other aspects of our policy in the cold, hard realities of daylight and see the money that this Government has been prepared to spend in regard to the wool industry and the money that it has poured into the beef industry, surely such claims fall flat on their face. </para>
          <para>The dairy industry has changed, is changing and of course must continue to change. Hundreds or perhaps thousands of dairy farmers have gone out of the occupation over the last 1 5 or 20 years. The industry is tending to settle itself into what one might describe as the traditional dairy farming areas rather than in the marginal land as was sometimes the case in the past. This has been done not out of desire but out of necessity, as we see if we trace the history of the dairy industry in this country since the settlement by white Anglo-Saxons some 200 years ago. </para>

              <para>- I take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner&#39;s</inline> point, it was probably an invasion. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bessell</inline> has mentioned, the dairy industry requires people to work long hours- in many areas, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. For that reason it has become exceedingly difficult in that industry to obtain labour, particularly youthful labour. One cannot blame young people for wanting to work a 40-hour, 5-day week so that they can go and play football or drink beer on a Saturday or Sunday or do things that their mates in town want to do. Because of this the industry has tended to become more capital intensive, and this in turn has created a problem for young people to be able to establish themselves on a dairy farm. A dairy farm is probably no worse than a sheep farm or a beef farm but because the industry is capital intensive it is creating problems for the young people who wish to enter into it. The figures that have been taken out over recent years show that the average dairy farmer in Australia is of my age group and older. I know jolly well that if I tried to go back and milk 85 cows right now I would not be able to manage it. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>As I mentioned before, in the past the industry has been fragmented into 2 sections. This has created deep divisions within the industry. We find that one section of the industry has had access to the liquid milk market, which is a reasonably lucrative market, and the other section has had access only to the manufacturing section. As a result of situations that have evolved and as a result of agitation, moves are being made in the dairy industry. At least in Victoria the situation is being reached where every dairy farmer in that State will have access to both markets. That in turn will create much less friction and will lead to a greater degree of unity in the industry there. In conclusion, I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture for his endeavours in this field. Since he took up his portfolio he has done a magnificent job, despite what our political opponents and many conservative farmers outside have said. At least the dairy farmers, the beef farmers, the wheat farmers and the other farmers who have had the honour to sit down and discuss matters with the Minister have all gone away agreeing that he is a man who will sit and discuss matters with them and that he is one of the best Ministers, if not the best Minister, in charge of primary industry that this country has ever seen. </para>

            <para>- The Senate is nearing the end of this sitting and of course the Bill to amend the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, not being an important Bill, but still being a Bill which must be resolved, finds its place towards the end of the list of business. The Bill is one which the Opposition does not oppose; the Opposition recognises the purposes which the amendments contained in the Bill are designed to serve. I recall that some three or four years ago the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act was amended by provisions of a comparable character to the ones which are now proposed for the Northern Territory Supreme Court Act. As the jurisdiction of the Territory supreme courts grows then provision must be made so that particular matters can be dealt with by courts which consist of more than the traditional one judge, the system which has characterised the development of superior court jurisdictions in the Territories. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This Bill does 4 separate and significant things. In the first place it provides that the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory is to be constituted of not fewer than 3 judges when it is dealing with matters relating to the professional behaviour and conduct of a legal practitioner. I think that there is a need for recognition of the fact that the conduct of barristers and solicitors being subject to the jurisdiction of the supreme court is one of the safeguards that the community has that barristers and solicitors will behave with propriety. I think it is known throughout the Commonwealth that there are very stringent powers, including the ultimate power of taking away a man&#39;s livelihood, which supreme courts can exercise over barristers and solicitors. The Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory had until 1971, and the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory has at the present time, the power which the State Supreme Courts have to exercise virtually, in terms of professional livelihood, a power of life and death over practitioners. I can agree with the Government that it is desirable that that power should be exercised by a court comprised of more than one judge. The principle which was applicable to the Australian Capital Territory in 1971 is a principle which can readily be accepted as now applying to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. The Opposition finds itself in accord with the Government on that proposal. </para>
          <para>The second step which the Bill proposes is that the Supreme Court be constituted of not fewer than 3 judges if a matter arises which in the opinion of the judge who is presiding over the case ought to be decided by a court comprised of not less than 3 judges. This step was taken in regard to the Australian Capital Territory in 1 97 1 . I know that there is no discretion or no test laid down as to the circumstances in which a judge may make this decision. It is left to the judge to decide which case is a proper case. As I understand it, it has worked without great criticism, if any criticism at all, in the Australian Capital Territory. I expect it will work in the same way in the Northern Territory. The right on occasions when there is a difference of opinion between individual judges, when considering past decisions, to decide what should be the law or what is the law in an area in which there are apparently diverging decisions, is a desirable power which a judge should have. In circumstances such as that he can refer the matter to a court consisting of 3 judges. </para>
          <para>It need not be supposed that there will be an increase in the number of judges in the Northern Territory. I think at the moment there are 2 resident judges of the Northern Territory and a number of other judges who hold commissions in other jurisdictions are available to attend in the Northern Territory as the occasion requires. It is a logical and progressive development. </para>

              <para>-There are attractions, but I feel that I should not be diverted from the urgent matters at hand which have commanded the attention of the Senate so much in recent days. I think it is part of the normal progression and development that the Supreme Court should have the power to constitute a court of three when particular issues require it. There is no need for there to be additional judges because there is an adequate number of judges to comprise a court of three as the occasion arises. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The third thing which the Bill does is to clarify in a manner which accords with judicial interpretation of similar words contained in the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act certain words which appear in the Northern Territory Supreme Court Act. The words &#39;convicted on indictment before the Supreme Court&#39; were subjected to judicial interpretation ten or eleven years ago. Following that interpretation an amendment was made to the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act. It is appropriate that a comparable amendment be made to the Northern Territory legislation, and that is one of the objectives of this Bill. The fourth matter which is dealt with is a procedural matter. The amendment ensures that if the venue of a trial is to be determined by a court the power of the court to determine that venue is laid down so that there can be no challenge to that power. The Northern Territory Supreme Court legislation has been before this parliament on a number of occasions during recent years. When the LiberalCountry Party Government was in power discussions took place with the representatives of the Northern Territory Legislative Council. I well remember that one of the matters which the Liberal-Country Party Government proposed should be entirely within the competence of the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory was the administration of the law- the control of the police forces, and the control of the courts, including the control of the Supreme Court. </para>
          <para>I think one of the initial steps which ought to be seen in the development of self-government in any territory is the handing over to the local people of the power generally to maintain law and order in their territory. That involves the ability to maintain the police forces and- putting it briefly- to establish and to run the courts in which the law is enforced. I would have thought that this is one matter which could well be handed over to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I hope it will not be long before this power is conferred upon the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. In recent times the people of the Northern Territory elected a Legislative Assembly in accordance with legislation which was enacted by this present Government. I think this present Government has been slothful because it has not yet given to the Legislative Assembly any executive powers. I pose the question: What is the value of having a representative assembly which does not have any powers to excercise? I think the advances which were made up until we went out of government were taking the people of the Northern Territory along a quite clear course which was leading to selfgovernment, which was in accord with the wishes of the elected Legislative Councillors and the national Government and which, if oppurtunity had been allowed to develop, would have provided a tremendous satisfying form of selfgovernment. </para>
          <para>The course of conduct of 1 972 was brought to an abrupt end with the change of government and a different approach to self-government was adopted, including this concept of an elected Legislative Assembly. All I say is that I hope some substantive area of control will be given to this Legislative Assembly instead of the area of simply discussion and talking, which apparently is its present role. It seems to be relevant to raise this matter in this debate because amendments to the Northern Territory Supreme Court legislation, I think, are properly matters which ought to be able to be dealt with by the Northern Territory people themselves. This is possibly an aspect which looks to the future of the Supreme Court rather than to the text of the Bill. We recognise the need for the amendments. We support them. </para>

            <para>- The Government is grateful to the Opposition for its constructive attitude towards this Bill. It is gratifying to learn that a Party which does not believe that the Northern Territory should have any representation in the Senate at least believes it should have an efficient functioning Supreme Court. There is only one matter which has not been adverted to in the debate but which has been drawn to my attention by our alert and percipient wit- Whip - </para>

              <para>-Both are correct. I am referring to a matter which is in the Bill but which has not been noticed by other honourable senators. I am referring to clause 3 of the Bill which refers to the Bill extending not only to the Northern Territory but also to the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> has directed a question to me as to the exact geographical location, the ecological idiosyncrasies and the ethnic peculiarities of these territories- Ashmore and Cartier Islands. I must confess, to adopt the language of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in another place, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> caught me with my pants down. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser,</inline> in a spirit of co-operation and anxiety to ensure that the program is not delayed in this place, has assured me that he will not hold this legislation, up until the questions that he raised are answered to his satisfaction. Therefore I propose that I be authorised to make inquiries into the matters that he has raised and that the Bill proceed pending satisfaction of his understandable curiosity about this matter. </para>

            <para>-I draw the attention of the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> to clause 6 of the Bill which deals with the exercise of jurisdiction in relation to legal practitioners and the power of a judge to order that jurisdiction in a matter be exercised by not less than 3 judges. It also refers to certain consequential provisions if that power is exercised. I adverted to this in passing during the second reading debate. But I raise the matter as to whether or not the Government considers that the provisions of this clause are adequate. </para>

              <para>- I think they are probably sections 13a and 13b. They raise an issue which will probably become an issue of greater importance in the future than it has been in the past. That is the actual composition of the bench of the court which is to determine matters, including particularly matters relating to the professional behaviour or conduct of a legal practitioner. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>For example, it is beyond dispute, as a recent article in the &#39;Australian Law Journal&#39; declared, that a judge cannot take part in the decision of a matter in respect of which he has already appeared as counsel to argue one side of the case- a view which I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> might well remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy accepted when he declined to sit on the case in which it was argued whether or not the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill was a valid exercise of power by the Commonwealth Parliament. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy&#39;s reasoning was that because of his earlier association with the subject matter of the proceeding, he should not sit. This, I think, is likely to become a matter of some consequence because of the growing number of appointments to judicial office of persons who have had some involvement with issues which are to be litigated. </para>
          <para>I mentioned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy in regard to the particular case which he raised, because more recently there was a case in which he did sit. That was the case as to whether the Senate should have representation from the Territories. That of course was a matter upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy had given advice. Why he sat on that case and not on earlier cases has never been satisfactorily explained. I hope it will do nothing to imperil the integrity of the courts of this country. I raise this because nothing is said about the composition of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in matters in which the Supreme Court may be called upon to adjudicate and some of the judges may have been involved in the issues which are to be litigated. I raise it because I am interested to know whether the Government feels that this is a matter at any stage for legislative prohibition or restraint, or whether it is a matter which ought to be left to the persons who are appointed to a bench to decide for themselves or for parties to the litigation to raise by way of protest in the litigation. It is not a matter of no consequence. It is a matter which I think strikes at the very integrity and public acceptance of our judicial system. Recent events to which I have adverted in passing I think highlight the point, and I should be grateful for the Minister&#39;s response. </para>

I can recall an occasion in the Australian Industrial Court- the Commonwealth Industrial Court as it was known before that word was ostracisedwhen a challenge was made to the propriety of  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Dunphy sitting in a matter involving the Australian Workers Union, the objection being based on the fact that a firm of lawyers with whom  His  Honour had been associated before he was elevated to the bench had acted for the union. I was in court at the time and  His  Honour rejected with great indignation the idea that his mind would be affected in any way by the fact that he or his firm had had a previous professional association with one of the parties to the litigation. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> will agree that there is a remarkable capacity in lawyers, once they have been elevated to the bench, to dissociate themselves from the sympathies or prejudices which they appeared to have when they were in the jungle of legal practice. </para>

              <para>- I would rather not. The fact is that it has never been considered that legislatures should write into the statutes of any country the type of prohibition which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is suggesting. I do not think he went any further than to suggest that the problem should be adverted to. I did not understand him to be saying that an inflexible prohibition should be put into this statute or any statute on legal practitioners who had been elevated to the bench declining to sit in matters which might involve clients whom they had had when they were out in the jungle of legal practice. Nothing is included in any of the statutes over which the Liberal-Country Party Coalition had control in a long period of 23 years. It must have been apparent during that long dark period that this was an ever-present danger. In fact, the matter to which I have adverted involving <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Dunphy arose during the life of the previous coalition Government. </para>

              <para>- It is arguable. The fact is, however, there was abundant opportunity for the Liberal-Country Party coalition in its 23 years in office, a rather long period, to cure this evil and to cure various other evils. However, these evils subsisted and landed on our plate and even though we have not been able to cure them I do not think it is quite fair that we should be blamed for them. I assure the honourable senator that I will ponder the proposition that he has put, as I ponder every proposition that he puts, and that in the higher councils of our Party I will make those who make the decisions conscious of the suggestion he has made for improving the statutory framework of our country. I will be happy to report to him at some future time as to whether I have been able to persuade the Government of the merits of his suggestion. </para>

            <para>- This is a most important Bill. The object of it is to establish the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The long term objective of this legislation is to permit this Parliament to take such steps as may be within its power to preserve for posterity the wonders of the Great Barrier Reef and, as has been said in debate in another place, to preserve not only a major part of Australia&#39;s heritage but also to preserve an important and valuable part of the heritage of the world. This legislation sets up an authority to manage the Marine Park and provides it with very wide powers. The area that is covered by the legislation is vast. It extends along virtually the whole length of the Pacific coast of Queensland from Cape York in the north to a point somewhere adjacent to Fraser Island, I think, in the south, and a great distance out into the Pacific Ocean. The boundaries of the Marine Park have been drawn to encompass the whole area of the Great Barrier Reef. This area is to be known as the Great Barrier Reef region. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>A marine park for the whole region will not be created under this Bill. It simply will give the Governor-General power to declare areas of the region to be a part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. This in itself is rather surprising. One would have thought that if powers are to be given to preserve the Great Barrier Reef, if there is to be a Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, those controlling powers should cover the whole of the Great Barrier Reef. I presume it is the intention that at least some powers should be exercised in respect of the whole of this region; but it does seem as though it is intended that the legislation will have a more restrictive effect and that only portions of this great region will be controlled and become a marine park. I think the Senate would welcome some elaboration by the Government of its intentions. I notice that this matter was raised in the debate in another place but no indication was given as to what portions of the Great Barrier Reef would be declared to be a marine park. </para>

              <para>- I noticed in the second reading speech made by the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bishop)</inline> that there is no further elaboration of that point. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> asked a question about the islands. That is a matter which is of considerable concern when dealing with the control of this region. This Bill does not cover islands in the ordinary sense. It is designed to cover the reefs and cays throughout the region but islands throughout the region will still be part of the State of Queensland. There is no power in this Parliament to disturb the powers of the Queensland Government in relation to the islands within the region any more than there is to establish parks in a State unless the Government resumes areas of the State or the areas are conferred on it by the State. Throughout the region covered by this Bill there are a vast number of islands which will not come within the jurisdiction of the Authority which is to be established. Although that matter represents problems for the administration of the region it does not detract from the importance of this Bill, the object of which is to preserve the Great Barrier Reef, or the reefs and cays themselves. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I hasten to say that the Opposition supports the Bill. We welcome the initiatives taken to ensure that there are proper methods of protecting this priceless heritage. However we are concerned about some of the steps which will be taken under this Bill and the manner in which this Government has gone about the establishment of this Authority to cover this area. The point of major concern is the relations between this Government and the Queensland Government and indeed the relations between the proposed Authority and the Queensland Government. I do not think there is any doubt that if we of the Opposition had- been responsible for establishing this Authority we would have done so as a joint co-operative exercise with the Queensland Government. In the first place it is not yet established that this Parliament indeed has the powers which are necessary to give proper effect to the legislation. </para>
          <para>As the Senate would be very well aware from the debates which have taken place here, the sovereignty over the off-shore areas of Australia has not yet been determined. Although legislation on this subject has been passed through this Parliament it is still a subject of consideration by the High Court of Australia and no decision has yet been made by the High Court which will clarify the nature of the powers of the respective parliaments of the Commonwealth and of Queensland. Therefore, before this Bill can really be known to be effective we will have to await the decision of the High Court. Nevertheless, if the High Court&#39;s decision is that the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia has the power beyond low water mark this Bill will have validity, of course, insofar as we can as a national parliament exercise jurisdiction out into the Pacific Ocean to the extent of sixty or seventy miles of the ocean itself. If we are to exercise these powers effectively there will arise not only the questions of the control of the reefs themselves and of the subsoil of the sea bed but there will also be questions arising as to jurisdiction over the waters themselves, as to the fisheries within them, as to navigation rights and so forth. So it is quite clear that the exercise of powers under this Bill raises and will raise a vast number of very difficult questions not only of Australian constitutional law but also of international law. </para>
          <para>However, I do not propose to canvass those here. They are not really particularly questions for us as members of the Senate; they are matters, of course, for determination by judicial authorities in due course. However, I think it would be fair to say that it is our responsibility as legislators to consider the Bill. I think the </para>
          <para class="block">Government is to be applauded for having exercised responsibility in bringing forward legislation which will do what can be done by this Parliament and by the Government of this country fully to preserve, to protect and to advance the protection of this whole area known as the Great Barrier Reef region. </para>
          <para>The Bill establishes, as I have already indicated, an authority which will be responsible for the administration of the region, but in particular of course, the marine parks that are established within it. There is a further complication in the legislation. I hope that some clarification will be given to it. It involves a power to establish special zones within the region where a park is established. This power to establish special zones within that park will be administered not by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Authority but by the national parks and wildlife authority. That is a further complication in the administration of the area. I do not understand why it is particularly necessary. </para>

Hopefully, though, we will be able to get home tonight and we will not have to spend another day debating this question, no matter how interesting it may be. As I have already said the matter which really concerns the Opposition is the composition of the Authority and the relations which it will have with the Queensland Government. It is perfectly obvious that it is not a practical proposition for the Commonwealth Government or an authority of that Government to exercise powers within an area of this kind without having to co-operate at almost every point with the Government of the State which is adjacent to the area and which controls a large number of islands which are within the area. If we in the Opposition were responsible for bringing forward this legislation and establishing this Authority we would do so entirely in cooperation with and as a joint exercise with the Government of Queensland or the government of the State which was vitally concerned with the area. </para>

In another place 2 very important matters were inserted into the Bill. One related to the composition of the Authority, which will consist of 3 persons, that is the  chairman  and 2 others. One of the members of the Authority will be appointed by the Queensland Government. We welcome that, although we do not think that it goes far enough. As I have said, if we had been responsible for this legislation we would have provided for equal representation on this Authority between the Queensland Government and the Commonwealth Government. </para>
          <para>The second matter related to the Great Barrier Reef Consultative Committee which is an important part of the legislation and of the administration of this area. It will draw upon a large number of experts, not necessarily with academic expertise but with practical expertise and knowledge of the Reef and of the region. This Consultative Committee will consist of a member of the Authority and of not less than 12 other persons determined by the Minister. We are very pleased to find that as a result of representations made by our shadow Minister in another place not less than one-third of the members of the Committee will also be appointed by the Queensland Government. However, again in relation to this matter the Opposition would have provided for equal representation on this Committee between the Queensland Government and the Commonwealth Government. I think an important matter to be stated by the Opposition is that when we are returned to Government, which may well be at an early date and perhaps before this Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority legislation is well advanced, we will certainly renegotiate with the Queensland Government this question concerning the administration of this legislation. We will be bringing forward early legislation to give effect to such renegotiation. We will give full and adequate representation to the interests of the Queensland Government in this important matter. </para>

          <para class="block">Queensland senators on this side of the chamber, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> who will be speaking later, will have a good deal of knowledge of what steps have been taken in the past to protect the environment in this region. The situation is a bit like the situation we had a week or two ago in relation to the Australian Heritage Commission Bill. The Labor Government is trying to suggest that it discovered our heritage and that it was discovered only in 1972. We have seen that those claims are very dubious indeed. I think it is probably true that that sort of claim is just as dubious in relation to this matter as it was in relation to the other matter. </para>
          <para>That is not to say that these matters do not demand and deserve greater attention than they have received in the past by all levels of government in Australia- the Commonwealth Government or the State governments. It is recognised by all sides of political life in this country that these matters deserve and demand greater attention and greater financial assistance than has been given by governments in the past. We are the first to acknowledge that fact, to welcome this legislation and to express our high hopes that is shall be effective. I have already made some mention of the powers that can be exercised by the Authority, for example, the establishment of marine parks and of special zones within the region. There are very wide powers of regulation in relation to the whole of the region. I am pleased to see that the Bill requires that any plans for the management of marine parks will be laid on the table of both Houses of Parliament and the Parliament itself will have the opportunity of debating them and, if necessary, disallowing them. This is a very welcome initiative. A similar provision is contained in the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Bill which we passed a few months ago. I hope that in the future this Parliament will take a good deal of interest in debating these questions when they come before it from time to time. </para>
          <para>However, powers will be exercised also in relation to a great many commercial activities in the region. There are very major commercial activities in the region, particularly tourism and fisheries. It will be most important that those very significant interests- not only the commercial interests but also the interests of people who in the past have moved around the region fishing for pleasure as well as commercially- should be fully protected and recognised, subject to the interests of preservation which is the object of this Bill. The Senate and the Parliament itself will have to be prepared to scrutinise the regulations as they come forward because they could have very serious effects on those most important interests. The Bill contains very wide powers. It contains powers which I think will create legal problems as well as problems concerning the preservation of the area, the ecology and so on. There will be political as well as legal problems. It will be a continuing and important role of this Parliament to maintain an interest in those problems. I hope that as a parliament and as representatives of the national heritage we will in the future take a very close and abiding interest in those most important questions. </para>

            <para>- I think it would be difficult to measure the pleasure, if I can use that word directly after a speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack,</inline> that many people, including myself, will have from the passage of this Bill. For many years now conservationists in Queensland, in particular a group called the Save the Reef Committee and another called the Great Barrier Reef Committee, have fought for the establishment of such an Authority. It has been a difficult struggle because of the many vested interests that sought to exploit the Reef. I do not wish to go right over that ground now but it was difficult to have established even a royal commission into oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef which took so long- some 5 years- to make a determination and recommendations, which were not unanimous. The only Australian on that commission, the  chairman,  came down for protection of this great area until much more research was done. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not doubt that the establishment of this Authority will lead to increased research. Those of us who watched the commission operate were perhaps silently critical or critical in private of the time that the commission was taking, but we did not really object, although it was a rather expensive operation in view of the time it was taking, because the royal commission established a moratorium on the Reef for some 5 years. It enabled public opinion to develop which, on the completion of its report, led to the establishment of the Authority. </para>
          <para>I inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> that not all people who have been critical of the Queensland Government have been members of the Australian Labor Party. In fact the most vocal people have been from opposing parties in Queensland. I refer to people like David Magnus,  chairman  of the Save the Reef Committee in Queensland, who is a member of a party opposed to my Party in Queensland but who took a very active part in the establishment of the royal commission into oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef. John Greenwood, who is now the Liberal member for </para>
          <para class="block">Ashgrove, also was very vocal. He took the same stand as I took, that is, that the Queensland Government does not deserve the consideration that has been extended to it in this Bill and does not deserve the representation which this Bill gives to it both on the Authority and the supporting Committee. </para>

          <para>I must express some concern about the Authority. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> pointed out, we are not establishing a national park, we are not establishing a wilderness area and we are not establishing by this Bill what we hope will be achieved eventually. Instead we are giving a very wide power to an authority to determine what should be done, and for that reason I think the vigilance of this Parliament and all parliamentarians must be exercised. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> mentioned, the Authority could make certain decisions which would be contrary to the wishes of the people of this country. It might make certain decisions on exploitation of certain areas of the Reef. It might fragment this great eco-system if we are not careful. It is for this reason that we must still exercise care. This is a great step forward. I make the point to those who will be responsible for making the appointments to the Authority that their first choice will be the important choice. The appointment of the  Chairman  of this Authority will be the most important decision made in this direction. </para>
          <para>The Great Barrier Reef Consultative Committee which is also provided for in this Bill must be viewed more importantly because appointments to the Consultative Committee will determine the nature of decisions made by the Authority. I trust that in appointing people to this Committee consideration will be given to the many organisations in Queensland and other places which have sought to protect the Great Barrier Reef. Previously I gave credit to David Magnus and John Greenwood. I would also like to give some credit to the Secretary of the Save the Reef Committee, Freda McLennan, who worked over the years with little administrative support to maintain the level of public opinion which was necessary to get the general acceptance of this legislation. Of course the work of these people and many other people has been considerable. Without it we would not have been able to have this bi-partisan debate here in support of the Bill. </para>
          <para>I am under some criticism for speaking on this Bill tonight but I think I should be given at least a little time, after so many years of struggle in this direction, to express my point of view. I do not think I should be denied that right tonight. I do not intend to speak for much longer, but I must make the point clear that the Great Barrier Reef, which consists of many islands which may have to be considered differently or which may have to come under a different responsibility, is one delicate eco-system and we must be careful in the decisions which we must make for its protection. Nevertheless we must have the courage to make those decisions which are necessary but which may not be popular or which may be unacceptable even to those people who live close to the Reef, who should know better; decisions which may be unacceptable to them because in the short term they may disadvantage them economically. We must disregard those attitudes, and the decisions which must be made to protect the Reef must be courageous and determined. </para>
          <para>I commend all those who have been responsible for the Bill. I commend the shadow Minister for Environment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt,</inline> for his cooperation. I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cass</inline> and the members of his former Department for bringing forward such excellent legislation which will well serve us and generations to come. It will serve not only Australia but the whole world, and particularly the nations that surround us. </para>

I remind him that the previous LiberalCountry Party Government was responsible for the creation of the Australian Institute of Marine Science at Townsville for the purpose of propagating a thorough knowledge of the Great Barrier Reef. I want to speak on this wonderful piece of nature as one who knows the Reef and who has been associated with it in its development from the tourist side and looking at it from other aspects for over 40 years. A lot of airy fairy talk goes on about the Reef. Personally I do not see the necessity for this legislation. Despite what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> the Queensland Government has been alert to the value of this wonderful asset and, in the main, has exercised control over it. </para>

As a result many of the islands of the Great Barrier Reef area and the inner reef area are today national parks. I think that the State governments over those years, irrespective of their political colour, have done a good job in looking after this very valuable asset. When people speak of the Great Barrier Reef they have different views about it. It always amazes me when people who live in the southern regions profess to know more about the Great Barrier Reef than we who live in the region of the Great Barrier Reef. The people <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> mentioned are mostly Brisbane people. They are mostly people who come from outside the Great Barrier Reef area. </para>

              <para>- The southernmost part of the Great Barrier Reef is in the Swain Reef area, but there is even a Great Barrier Reef institute in the Heron Island area. The island groups in that area are known as the Bunker and Capricorn groups. So there are distinct reef areas that are outside the range of the Great Barrier Reef area. What does the Great Barrier Reef area consist of, to most people? They mostly think of the mainland islands. It is reckoned that many years ago the islands, which are mountainous in character, were part of the mainland and became submerged. The hills and mountains of those areas are the peaks of what are today termed the mainland islands. Then one gets the other aspects of the Reef. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>What is the Reef? The Reef has several features. First there is the main Barrier Reef structure. The reason it was named the Great Barrier Reef is because it is the greatest barrier type of reef in the world. It is a barrier-like structure. It is not solid all the way down. There are breaks in it. There are reefs that are probably one mile, 5 miles, 10 miles or 15 miles long and that might be one mile or 2 miles deep; then it dips again and then comes up in another area before going further back in another direction. Sometimes there can be a series of reefs 40 or 50 miles across that come up and dip down and come up again and dip down again. They are not always parallel with each other. Sometimes they edge beyond the points of the different reefs. That, of course, is the true structure of the Great Barrier Reef. </para>
          <para>Within the confines of the Reef there are also what are termed coral cay. The coral cay is really that part of the coral that has broken up into a sandy mass and, swirling around the Reef and catching in certain places, with the swirling of the tides there is developed over probably a matter of centuries what is called a coral cay. It might be 100 acres or something of that nature in size. It is just a sandy base on top of dead coral. Then there are the coral atolls. They are similar to the cay insofar as they have coral around them but the sand has not yet swirled in and settled down. So there is a lagoon in the area. That is what is a coral atoll. Then there are what are termed the mainland islands. Around these mainland islands are very beautiful fringing coral reefs. So far as the people are concerned, those are probably the 4 components of the Great Barrier Reef. There is a lot of silly talk about the destruction of the Reef. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> talked about drilling for oil on the Reef. Of course it sounds a very dangerous thing. But how many oil wells really blow out? </para>

              <para>- A lot of silly nonsense is talked about destruction of the Reef, and that is just one illustration. I want to talk about another aspect of the Reef. The Reef is one of nature&#39;s great creations. But just as nature builds, so does nature destroy and rebuild. As I have said before, I can still remember the most beautiful area of coral that I have ever seen, with the greatest variety of form and the greatest variety of beautiful coral. This was around Tern Island and Bushy Island about 60 to 70 miles east of the city of Mackay. The corals which I saw there over 30 years ago are still as beautiful in my mind today as they were when I first saw them. When one stood on the Great Barrier Reef structure a few miles beyond the islands the corals were of such surpassing beauty that one could never forget them. I speak not only of the beauty of the corals, the colours and the form, but also of the glory of the fish that swam between the different crevasses in the Reef. </para>

          <para>The main structure of the Great Barrier Reef is very much like a sunken range of mountains with ravines and gorges on a small scale.

I thought that this area was magnificent. Some years later I took to this area the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr A.</inline> E. Cole, the Director-General of the Queensland Government Tourist Bureau, who unfortunately was killed in a plane crash at Mackay while performing island and Reef business. But what had happened? You talk about destruction. All that beautiful coral looked like a heap of stones on a creek frontage. There was nothing of the coral left. Do you know why? </para>

              <para>- Nature had destroyed it. It was destroyed completely when the tide was out in a period when 55 inches of rain fell in 3 days. That was a tragedy, but I believe that today the reef is as beautiful as ever it was. Nature builds; nature destroys; and nature rebuilds. A short time ago there was a great old pandemonium about the Crown of Thorns starfish. There is no doubt that it was eating and killing the coral. But once again, was it an act of nature? The infestation of the Crown of Thorns took place not only on the Great Barrier Reef but also in places like Fiji and in other coral reefs. </para>

              <para>- We may not be doing something but nature is. Today the coral reefs which were once so thickly infested with the Crown of Thorns are recovering from that visitation. It is very nice to say that one must not cut off a piece of coral or one must not do something else, but from talks which I have had with people who have taken coral for certain reasons- they have pruned the coral in the right place and looked after it in the proper manner- I believe that the pruning of the coral reef can have the same effect as pruning in the garden. We may find in the ultimate that some of these practices will really improve the situation. So I think we have to be a bit sensible about this preservation business. I am one who stands very strongly for the preservation of beautiful things. I have, always appreciated the attitude taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> in his fight for the preservation of our fauna. No one stands more than I do for the preservation of beautiful things. </para>

          <para>I feel that in the Great Barrier Reef we have possibly one of the very greatest of nature&#39;s attractions. It is of such infinite variety and of such dimension that I believe that, in spite of the damage that might be done here and there, in the overall, the Great Barrier Reef cannot be so very greatly destroyed. I believe that over the years the people of the State of Queensland have become conscious of the need to preserve the Reef. It is a lot of silly nonsense for the Australian Government to think that all knowledge about our assets in Queensland lies in Canberra and it should at least give us the benefit of realising that in Queensland, too, we have got sensible people. </para>
          <para>The Great Barrier Reef is a great asset with a great variety of features. I believe that its possibilities are immense. Properly handled and directed it has possibilities not only from the point of view of fishermen and collectors who want to treat what they collect in the proper way but also from the point of view of the tourist. When more modern methods of transportation are available- of course, that can be very costlypeople will realise what a wonderful place it is and more people will go to see the Great Barrier Reef, which, so far as I am concerned, is the greatest natural masterpiece in this country. It is known as the Great Barrier Reef because it is the biggest and the greatest barrier reef in the world. I am very keen on preservation but I want to be known that all the forces of preservation are not to be found in Canberra and in States other than Queensland. The Queensland Government is conscious of the need to look after this very great natural attraction. </para>

            <para>- I want to keep faith with my Whip, and I simply intervene in the debate to seek some information from the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bishop)</inline> when he replies to the debate. I illustrate my point by referring to the protection of the dolphin. I want to know what is indicated in this legislation in relation to the future phasing out of the authority of the Department of Transport as it affects lighthouses and beacons which have a role to play on the Great Barrier Reef and elsewhere. Secondly, I ask how will the existing powers of the Minister for Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> and his control over fisheries be phased out? I would like some clarification in those areas. </para>

          <para>I conclude my remarks by pointing out to honourable senators that the need for regulations was exemplified in the reasonably successful control of drilling on Barrow Island and in the Gulf of Mexico. When one reads magazines such as &#39;Lamp&#39; and &#39;Petroleum News&#39; one sees the eulogistic references to how the industry has lived up to its obligations. But if those regulations did not exist the oil drilling companies may not be so conscious of what they should be doing. I leave it at that. </para>

            <para>- Like my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack,</inline> I rise not to oppose the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Bill but to welcome its introduction. I believe that it is high time that legislation of this kind was introduced into the Parliament. The Great Barrier Reef, running from the Cape York Peninsula to well down the Queensland coast, is one of the great wonders of the world. I believe that if we can do anything to preserve this great reef and this great wonder of the world we should be doing it, and that we all should be united in our attitude towards achieving that end. As a Queenslander I am very proud- I know that all Queenslanders are proud- of our Great Barrier Reef. We realise that it must be preserved as part of our national heritage. But unlike other States which have national heritages which are part of the State and which lie within the State, the Great Barrier Reef is adjacent to the coast of Queensland and probably falls into a different category to other areas of this nature. As I have said, as Queenslanders we are very proud of the Barrier Reef. I must say on behalf of the Queensland Government that over a number of years it has done a lot towards protecting this great wonder of the world. It is not a great wonder only for Australians. It is something of which all mankind should be proud, and it should be preserved for all mankind and not just Queenslanders and Australians. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The reef itself covers a vast area. In some places along the coast of Queensland it may be only 5 or 6 miles from the shore. In other areas it can run up to 60 miles out from the shore. Unfortunately, many people do not have a complete understanding or appreciation of the Great Barrier Reef. There are people who think that the Great Barrier Reef is the part of the reef which is exposed at low tide and which people can view, to see the beauty and the wonderful colours to which my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> has referred, together with the marine life, the fish and the other forms of life on the reef. Unfortunately, what people do not seem to realise is that a great amount of this Great Barrier Reef is not exposed and is not even visible to people who may travel over it by boat or by any other means. A vast amount of the reef is submerged under water. Whilst I believe it is good that we are able to introduce legislation to protect the reef, I am a little concerned at some points which were made in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wheeldon).</inline> I hope that the Minister will be able to give me at least some assurance, because I have some apprehension about certain points. The Minister stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Once the legislation is passed, the Government will be able to declare and protect zones of the Reef as national parks or nature reserves, which will then be managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I have no argument with that part of his speech. But he went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Other zones will be set aside for tourist development, for shipping, fishing and other appropriate uses. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The last part of that sentence gives me some concern. I hope the Minister will be able to give me some clarification with regard to &#39;other appropriate uses&#39;. As my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> saidthough I do not agree with all he said- for a number of years there has been talk of the possibility that oil can be found on the Great Barrier Reef. That is one reason I am concerned at the words &#39;other appropriate uses&#39;. I hope that that does not mean that the Government or the people who will be responsible for the preservation of the Reef will not be too hasty if ever they are contemplating giving permission for drilling on the Great Barrier Reef. The words other appropriate uses&#39; in the Minister&#39;s second reading speech do concern me because the meaning is not spelt out. </para>
          <para>I do not agree with my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> who says that it does not matter if drilling takes place on the Barrier Reef because only one in every 1000 oil wells has blown out and caused any problems. Just a few years ago we had a classic example of what can happen to the wondrous Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Queensland. An oil tanker went aground there and the oil from it spilled and was drifting around the waters of the Great Barrier Reef. Much of the reef was destroyed and also the culture pearl industry, which was of great value to Queensland, was destroyed. Many of the farms that were established in the northern part of Queensland were completely wiped out. The occurrence could have had great effect on the Reef itself. Last year I visited Bamaga, an Aboriginal community on the Cape York Peninsula. I was up there to open the Bamaga show. I was taken to the furthermost point of the Cape York Pen.sinsula and evidence of the oil spill was still there. It is still there today. Great blobs of this oil are on the rocks all around the edge of the Cape York Peninsula showing what can happen when there is an oil spillage. </para>
          <para>Until a complete investigation, an environmental study and scientific research is made to find out whether drilling can be undertaken on the Reef with safety I hope that this legislation will afford protection to the Reef. I hope that drilling will not be permitted on the Great Barrier Reef or, for that matter, off the Great Barrier Reef. It does not matter whether drilling is undertaken on the Reef, off it or over the edge because if there is an oil blowout the Reef can be destroyed. As I said earlier this is not just a matter for the people of Queensland or even for the people of Australia. I believe that this Reef and its wonders must be preserved for the whole of mankind. As I said earlier we in Queensland are conscious of this and have been conscious of it for a long time. Apart from everything else we have had an opportunity over a number of years to see millions of people- not only Australians but also people from overseas- flocking to Queensland to view the wonders of the Great Barrier Reef. The tourist industry contributes greatly to the economy of Queensland. The Reef is there and it must be preserved for all of mankind. </para>
          <para>I spent many years living on an island off the coast of Queensland. I had the opportunity to swim on many parts of the Reef looking for trochus shell. At times the Aboriginal community on Palm Island were able to make some money from the gathering of trochus shell. The Torres Strait Islanders conducted this kind of business for many years. The Great Barrier Reef has an abundance of wealth to offer, not only to the people of Queenland but also to all mankind. So I am very happy this evening to support this measure. I am also very happy to note that the Queensland Government will be represented in this endeavour to preserve the Great Barrier Reef. Perhaps one could express some disappointment that there is not more representation from the Queensland Government and the Queensland people. I am a firm believer in the federal system, but I am also a firm believer in a co-operative federal system, not a centralist system where all power is vested in Canberra. I hope that some time in the very near future when the Opposition Parties regain the Government benches we will be able to review this legislation and ensure that the people of Queensland have greater representation on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. </para>

            <para>- Firstly I would like to thank honourable senators who took part in this debate for their very co-operative attitude. It is clear to me and, I think, to everybody that this legislation represents a great advance. It parallels the work done in this area by other countries. Australia has been behind in this activity. The discussions that have occurred in the other place and here tonight indicate that almost everybody is in favour of the legislation. As honourable senators know, the former Minister for Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Cass)</inline> in the other place was helpfulthe Opposition was helpful also- when a number of the clauses were considered in accepting a number of amendments to satisfy the Opposition. Apart from one or two luke warm comments in the debate it is obvious that everybody here welcomes this great new move by the Government. Apart from the comments about the co-operation with Queensland, it is clear that everybody agrees that the Government is taking a new initiative and it is clear that that initiative was possible because many people contributed to the development of the scheme which is before the Senate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I want to mention particularly my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges.</inline> As everybody knows, he has played quite a role in this scheme. But he was good enough to mention those on the other side who also made a contribution to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> raised a number of queries. The first and most important one is why the scheme does not embrace the whole of the Reef. The purpose of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority will be to examine the entire Barrier Reef area and then to determine which sections of the region should be proclaimed as part of the park. The Bill makes provision for the way in which it shall be zoned. It states the criteria upon which that zoning will be made. So it may be that the whole of the Reef will not be zoned. Some areas could be undisturbed if by the process of examination the Authority so determines. For example, as everybody knows, the Authority initially will determine by examination the priority for zoning and then it must advertise the fact that certain areas will be zoned in a certain way. Representations may be made from the public as a result of that publicity. After decisions have been reached about the zoning and the general purposes of the area the matter will be considered by the consultative committee. </para>
          <para>Let me illustrate the way in which the Government has tried to respond to the Queensland Government&#39;s point of view. In the first instance it was proposed that the Australian Government would share the authority with the Queensland Government. The Queensland Government then came back and said that it would prefer to have one nominee on the Authority. State representation was, I think, in the first instance based on one-fifth but has now been expanded so that Queensland now has about a one-third representation. That consultative committee will consist of members of all of the most important and representational groups- the specialists. The committee having decided on the zoning that zoning will then be subject to the Minister&#39;s examination and the matter must then be placed before the Parliament. Parliament has to see what is done in respect of zoning. It will not be a quick process but a process which will take time. It is subject to a lot of pushes and pulls. There are certainly a number of safeguards against any arbitrary action. There will be some areas, of course- perhaps shipping lanes, recreational areas and fishing areas- which may not be disturbed. But the guidelines have to be developed over a number of months and the sooner the Authority sets about getting experience the better it will be. </para>
          <para>Another related question was why have these 2 authorities- that is, the Wildlife Service and the Marine Park Service. In relation to the Wildlife Service I think the answer must be that in some cases where there are national parks or where an area is finally decided to be a national park the expertise in that category of activities would be best vested in the Wildlife Service. Otherwise we could have 2 authorities operating in the one area. The Wildlife Service would be more concerned with the activities as set out in the Bill. As I think everybody now realises, there will be some areas- those not included in special zones- which will need a different type of management; that is, the fishing, tourist and shipping areas, where different sorts of management will be required to operate them properly. </para>
          <para>In addition, it must be said that it is possibleand it will be done in many cases- that the Authority will hand over to a State Government department or a local authority the operation and control of certain special areas. So there is a general program for the whole Barrier Reef region of step by step zoning and control and of sharing that control with appropriate bodies. There is also a consultative process which, it seems to me, is not only very necessary but is very democratic and an essential way to proceed. </para>
          <para>I know there are a lot of complexities and I think the Government is aware of them; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> referred to many of them. I think those complexities will probably become more amenable to scrutiny, discussion and change when the Authority sets to work. I hope the comment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> and, more latterly, the comment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> that honourable senators opposite will go over the Act again when they come to power will not inhibit the activities of the Authority because all of us should be aware of the need to get going with the Authority, get it established and let it go unhampered by any act of obstruction in the future. I take it that when the honourable senators mentioned that, they had no intention of throwing spanners in the works. Most honourable senators have accepted the measure with great pleasure and I thank them for their co-operation. </para>
          <para>It is left to me to reply to the matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill.</inline> He raised the question, firstly, of the lighthouses. There will not be any phasing out of lighthouse control or taking it over from the Transport Department because, if there is any special Australian Government service or any property owned by the Australian Government for lighthouse purposes there is no reason why that should not continue. There is no such intention. In relation to dolphins my advice is that dolphins are currently protected under the laws of most, if not all, of the States. However, this protection would extend only to the limit of State jurisdiction- generally a 3-mile limit. To ensure that dolphins in Australian waters are protected the Department of Agriculture is currently considering action under the Whaling Act which would have the effect of protecting them against any form of exploitation. The recently passed National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act extends also to marine mammals such as dolphins. Additional protection under that Act could be given when the regulations have been established. With those comments I thank the Senate for its contribution to this very important piece of legislation. </para>

            <para>-Thank you. It was opposed by the then Government but was carried because the members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party voted with the Opposition. As I recall it, it was moved at that stage because of a controversy concerning postal charges. Since the present Government came to power the Opposition moved a similar motion during the Autumn session in 1 973. It was never acted upon. There was no opportunity for one at this stage last year because we had a double dissolution, which rather obviated the need. </para>

            <para>-It is far too late tonight. I put it in this way: Should <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> amendment to my amendment be carried, it could be read as restricting the purpose for which the Senate could be called together again to the summoning of certain persons to attend as witnesses before the Senate. I put it to honourable senators that that is far too restrictive. There may well be other purposes for which the Senate ought to be called together again. I cannot elaborate on them because we do not know what circumstances may intervene. I could suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> that if he did not intend to be so restrictive after the word &#39;which&#39; he could insert the word &#39;may&#39;.

            <para>-Senator Hall&#39;s purpose is to make provision for the reassembly of the Senate for the purpose which he has already stated and for that purpose only. But I put to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunton</inline> the quite simple argument that neither the Liberal Party senators nor the Country Party senators on their own can muster the 3 1 senators to provide the absolute majority. Added to the 30 Liberal-National Country Party senators would have to be the name of either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunton.</inline> I am certain that they would have to be satisfied as to why we wish the Senate to reassemble. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Therefore I put to the Senate, particularly to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunton,</inline> that the purpose of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> amendment is not real. To restrict the meeting of the Senate in this way, as he attempts to do, I think shuts off too many options- not too many options just for the Opposition in which I include the Liberal and National Country Parties- but his own and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunton</inline> &#39;s options. That is what he would be doing. He would shut off the options of the 32 people who sit on this side of the House. As I said, one of those two senators- either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunton-</inline> must agree with the other 30 of us who sit on this side before the Senate can reassemble. I put to them that they ought not to close off their options but should support the amendment which I have moved without any further amendment thereto. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I commend my amendment to the Senate. </para>

        <para class="block">I have moved my amendment for a very definite purpose. Firstly, I say that it is acknowledged that it is normal for a Government to be in control of the business of the House. That is certainly the normal procedure of a House&#39;s operation, whether the Government has a majority in that House or not. That is the procedure which was adopted certainly in the place where I have come from, in South Australia. I must admit, however, that there could be circumstances of a very serious nature in which the Opposition might have a legitimate interest in reassembling the Senate. But I have deliberately framed my amendment to prevent another abject failure such as the Opposition suffered today in trying to attack the Government. I will not support the reassembling of the Senate before the time that the Government has set for it for another debacle by the Opposition. </para>
        <para>Everyone knows that today the Government really won the debate. I will explain why. Since 23 April when the Opposition first started to ask questions about the overseas loan affair, it has gained a certain amount of information concerning names from the Government. It has had those names for a considerable amount of time. The Opposition now relies heavily on the journey to come, I believe, of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> overseas to see the gnomes of Zurich and other mysterious people of Asian origin in mysterious places to confirm the evidence which so far is totally unconfirmed. Of course the problem with the Opposition is that it has totally misdirected its quest and totally misdirected its attack if that is what one could call the urgency motion today. </para>

            <para>- Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline> believes it or not worries me not at all. The situation is- and it must be said- that the secrets and the information which the Opposition desires are held by Anglo-Saxons who live in Canberra. That is where the information resides that the Opposition has said it wants, the Opposition which has become so adept at asking questions but not wanting the answers. Therefore, I will not be one to agree to the reassembly of the Senate so that the Opposition can again embarrass itself. There would have to be very good reasons indeed to take the situation one step further, and the only way in which the situation can be taken further is for the Senate itself to inquire into it. </para>

        <para>Anyone would know that, unless the Opposition has the information, Ministers in this style of government can avoid answering questions, and they are avoiding answering. The Government is hiding important information which is relevant to the Opposition&#39;s questions. It is because the Opposition cannot or will not produce the evidence behind its charges that the Government can sit there free of any real embarrassment. Today&#39;s debate simply has provided no answers and has greatly deepened the mystery and the implications for the Government and for the Senate. Yet the Senate is about to go home, and there is going to be some great play by the Opposition about recalling the Senate. I venture to say that the Opposition has no intention of recalling the Senate. It is a play on words, and it is a sop to the public by an Opposition that has failed to do a job. The Senate goes home on the very day that the mystery has grown to the extent that it has today following the disclosures made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland in his speech when he tabled the various documents. At the very peak of the question, the Senate goes home. </para>

            <para>- I do not mind a certain amount of help, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> but I should like it to be coherent. Why is it that the Opposition fears the information? It knows where it can get it. Tonight <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> said on television that it was facile for the Senate to call witnesses from departments because the Government might direct that they could not attend. Who is he protecting in this case? What could be more embarrassing for the Government than to deny its public servants permission to attend a request by the Senate? I would love to have the Government in that situation. It would be an admission of guilt. And yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> does not want that to happen. Who is he protecting? The Government, apparently. The Opposition has been badly led during this session in this chamber, and the issues have been neglected today. The issues are pretty clear. The Opposition has completely refused to investigate the situation concerning Harris and the deposed Treasurer. There lies one of the greatest mysterieswhy a man can go on the media last night and say: &#39;I have today consulted with the exTreasurer and he has arranged to put a proposition to the new Treasurer&#39;. Yet that exTreasurer lost his job last week because of communications with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris</inline> and this Opposition is to have a look in Zurich. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>What has emerged from the information which has been tabled today is- and this is a scene which cannot be denied, if it cannot be confirmed- that this is one of the greatest interdepartmental battles that the Public Service of the Commonwealth has ever seen. Look at the situation. We have the head of the Treasury who has had 3 different Ministers in six or eight months and the Minister has just been deposed. Who protects him against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor.</inline> Who protects him against the man who stamps on all opposition- the juggernaut of the Government? Who has denied the Minister for Minerals and Energy? Who stood in his way in his plans to borrow overseas? The Treasury. Who is suffering today? The Treasury. That is the scene that Opposition members cannot even see, yet it is in front of their very eyes. It is one of the greatest interdepartmental conflicts with the Department of Minerals and Energy which has grown at a fantastically compounded rate in the last several years, headed by a Minister who is known to crush all opposition. So <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> is even more firmly entrenched in his Department; with an ambitious head of Department. There is the head of Treasury without a Minister in the sense that there have been 3 Ministers in the last 6 or 8 months and there is now a new Minister to deal with. The Minister who has just been deposed broke off, in practical terms, relationships with the Treasury. The Treasury is vulnerable and it is vulnerable to the strongest man in the entire Government. </para>
        <para>What do we find? A minute was tabled today. One thing I would agree with in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> &#39; statement is the strangeness of getting together in words this conversation 5 months after it was made. Who signed it? It was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Larkin</inline> who, the Minister has to explain later in the House- I give him credit for so explaining- is not of the </para>
        <para class="block">Treasury; he is of the Department of Minerals and Energy. What sort of plot this could be. No one could deny that it does not exist in that way. It certainly seems on the evidence that the Department of Minerals and Energy would be quite happy to see <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler lose his job? </para>

            <para>- I hear that remark but I will not bother to repeat it. I hope that Hansard got it. This is the strangest of all minutes I have ever seen. It was brought into the Senate by a Minister who practically said that the Government is going to sack <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler. One could not take any other meaning from the words he used in the House, and this minute came from the Department of Minerals and Energy. This is where the real conflict lies. Yet the Opposition deals, as I said, with Europe. Why will it not agree to call to the Bar of the House- if we want to use dramatic terms- the people who could give the evidence to sort out whether or not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> put any of the Executive Council minute in the letter that he sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani?</inline> Did he or did he not? Is there any portin of this minute in the letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani?</inline> What has it to do with the Treasury that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> could not proceed with his loan raisings. What we can deduce is that the Treasury is being ransacked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> the Minister for Minerals and Energy. That is the scene, the most likely scene that presents itself to the Senate, and the members of the Senate are going home. I notice that there is quite a silent attitude displayed by members on the Government side. They know the conflicts that exist between those 2 Departments. They know the ambitions of the Minister for Minerals and Energy. My remarks are well founded on those ambitions. The person who is most vulnerable, the least protected, is under attack. </para>

        <para>There are 3 issues, as I see the situation. There is the overseas matter- the establishment of the Government&#39;s veracity. But this leads back, of course, to the Harris-Cairns communication. Does not the Senate think it serious that a Minister was demoted for making a communication to a man who lives in Melbourne, Australia. That does not seem to interest the Opposition very much. Surely that is the second issue. The third and most important issue of all is the relationship of the Department of Minerals and Energy to the Treasury. What is the Minister for Minerals and Energy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> doing to the Treasury, and how deeply are his departmental officers implicated in that attack on Treasury? How many more people have taken other parallel actions to put down a conversation 5 months old, a conversation which is so damaging to the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury? </para>
        <para>Honourable senators ought not go home until they know these things. Yet, as I have said, the Opposition presented itself here today and the Government laughed and considered itself free of any effective criticism. The Opposition simply threw small stones from a very great distance and every one of them dropped short. That is what has happened today. </para>

I am not willing to have another talk-fest in this chamber or some jolly phantom fight again simply to get the Senate reassembled. If we reassembled we have to do so for some serious reason. According to the amendment I moved that reason will include the arraigning of witnesses to attend the Senate. At least that is a reason. The reassembly would not be simply to have a propaganda fight and, as I say, it would save the Opposition embarrassment. </para>

As far as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> is concerned, I believe he deserves very serious censure for tonight once again blaming the officers of his former departments for the mistakes of his own creation. That is never to be approved by any government or any individual. The Senate, therefore, is evading its responsibilities. Its members are going home without doing their job. I believe that the most embarrassing issue that has confronted the Government since it took office will not be pursued. I therefore, really in a moment of despair, have moved an amendment which will have no influence on the issues which I have mentioned but at least if it is carried will not see this Senate reassembled for a phantom fight of no substance. </para>

          <para>- I second the amendment and I shall speak to it now. The purpose of the Opposition, which can on proper judgment control the course of this Senate&#39;s power, should be to keep this Senate vigilant during the period until the Parliament reassembles and to observe the quite obvious intention of this dictatorial Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> to dismiss the Secretary of the Treasury. We should have before us the results of the inquiry that is now said to be under way so that we can inform ourselves of the extent to which the Prime Minister has been able to inform himself of matters which affect loan raisings by this Government to the extent of $4,000m. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Contrary to the assertion of the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> that the only authority given was to investigate, the minute of the Government today revealed that there was an absolute authority given to a Minister to arrange that loan on such terms and conditions as he thought fit and to appoint any  deputy  that he thought fit to execute such documents in the name of Australia and to bind and oblige Australia to that huge debt. In those circumstances, with a prescience that the immediate period before us will reveal further interesting information, I believe that the Senate should keep open the option to meet at the behest of an absolute majority represented by the leaders of the Parties and the independents if in their judgment it is thought that the national interest requires it. That is the paramount consideration. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> has put forward a motion to preserve that right without specification. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> has introduced an amendment proposing that, upon such a request for reassembly, the Senate should reassemble for purposes which include the summoning of certain persons to attend as witnesses before the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> puts forward the view upon some advice, which I completely reject, that that amendment would restrict the reassembly of the Senate to that purpose alone. Nothing could be more contradictory to the terms of the amendment. The advice must be based upon a completely erroneous premise. One has only to read the language of the amendment which states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Provided that the  President,  upon a request or requests by an absolute majority of the whole number of Senators that the Senate meet at a certain time . . . </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The amendment then sets out purposes which include the summoning of certain persons to attend as witnesses before the Senate. Anybody who knows that the Senate can only summon witnesses by a resolution of the Senate when assembled knows that there is no mandatory effect in that amendment. That purpose would be included in our reassembly. On reassembly it would be for the Senate to decide whether it took that course. For us on this side to exclude that possibility from our capacity at that time is not the necessary result of rejecting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> amendment, but it would be contended that it was. For us now to deny the assistance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> to get a reassembly by denying his amendment would be foolish in the extreme. Therefore I make it my paramount purpose to retain a capacity in the majority of the Senate to require a reassembly during the vacation to supervise these emergent events and I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> amendment. I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers&#39;</inline> amendment. I shall support any other amendment which is designed to secure to this side of the chamber the capacity to reassemble. It is the Senate &#39;s public duty to reassemble if events develop so that a majority of the Senate, expressed through the leaders of the Parties, convey a request to the  President  that we should meet, lt is as simple as that. </para>
        <para>I am dismayed to think that our capacity to supervise those events could be prejudiced by a division of opinion on this side of the House as to an amendment which is facultative and not in any way mandatory as to whether we assemble and call witnesses. That is a course which has great merit and great potency. The quiet of the Government senators through all this debate as they see a division on this side betokens that they are hoping that our divisions will destroy us and so enable them to escape the scrutiny of the Senate on reassembly. I appeal to this side of the chamber either to adopt the language of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> amendment in simpliciter, or in debate and discussion evolve other language which will make it clear that it is an option for the Senate when we reassemble to decide by resolution whether we summon witnesses and secure on this side the capacity to require the Senate to reassemble before 19 August. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> language is quite sufficient for the purpose and is in no way restrictive of us when we reassemble. In default of better language I would consider myself as following a completely inexcusable course by not adopting that amendment, and so I will support it. </para>

            <para>- I am asked to explain why I think that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers&#39;</inline> amendment were carried simpliciter it would not be competent on reassembly for the Senate to summon witnesses. I have never suggested that it would not be competent to do so. But why is anybody on this side of the chamber of the view that we should not specifically refer to that as one of our options, especially when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall places such emphasis upon it? He is a requisite of the 31 here whose requests would enable the reassembly. That is why I will support both amendments. I only appeal to this side of the chamber to exorcise the internal division of mind and to concentrate upon retaining the capacity to reassemble the Senate. The adoption of words, whether they advantage one side or the other, is immaterial to me. </para>

I would appeal to the members of the Opposition to try to get together and to have some unity. The whole future of parliamentary government depends on having some sort of united Opposition. To have them fragmented before us when they cannot even agree on a simple matter, such as a question relating to the reassembly of the Senate, when we have seen sharp personal exchanges between prominent members of the Liberal Party, is something which I believe is distressing to those of us who believe in the democratic system and in the 2 party system. As a Government we believe that there should be an Opposition which can express to us a coherent point of view on the issues which come before us. </para>

        <para>When we find that the Opposition is incapable of even expressing a coherent point of view on the question of the reassembly of the Senate, we believe that democracy is in a very parlous condition. Although naturally such a disorganised rabble is unlikely ever to be elected to office, at the same time the Government believes that in the interests of constructive debate in this chamber there ought to be some sort of unity within the Liberal Party. I appeal to the members of the Liberal Party in the recess to resolve their differences, to get together to try to sort out what their common policy is, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers, Senator Wright</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> should shake hands, let bygones be bygones and bury the hatchet.

          <para>- I am only sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> has made his plea this Thursday instead of last Thursday. I am quite sure that a plea for unity would have been very acceptable in the Government last week. I do not rise to make a statement in this place which I might have issued to the media a couple of hours ago. Nor do I rise to say something on the urgency motion which was moved earlier in the day about which I might have had something to say. I am rather intrigued by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> saying that he was not able to get on the list of speakers today because this would be the first occasion of which I have known since he has been in the chamber that he has not been able to get on the list of speakers when he desired to do so. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> thinks that the Opposition fell down on its motion to debate a matter of urgency today and that we should sit on tomorrow or come back next week I believe that he should get up and move a motion to the effect that the Senate reconvene tomorrow morning or next Tuesday. I notice that he has not done so. </para>

        <para>All I want to do is support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers).</inline> Under the motion moved by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland)</inline> the Government can recall the Senate before the date on which we are due to meet again, 19 August, but the Opposition can bring back the Senate only if it has the support of 2 senators, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunton.</inline> As the Leader of the Opposition said, the amendment that he has moved is not new. It was moved in this place in 1967 by the then Opposition, the present Government, in respect of what I believe was a postal matter, and the then Opposition with the support of the Democratic </para>
        <para class="block">Labor Party had the Senate reconvened and the Senate sat for two or three days. So the Leader of the Opposition has taken the opportunity of moving an amendment to the motion of the Manager of Government Business in the Senate so that the Senate may be recalled should this foreshadowed situation arise. I fully support that amendment. </para>

          <para>- I rise to support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and to move an amendment to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> amendment. We are indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> for coming in here tonight and giving us one of the speeches from the Party room in the last few weeks. I am sure that it has been delivered many times and it is nice for us to know what he has been saying. As for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall,</inline> one can hardly say that the speech we heard from him tonight had any air of novelty. Many of us who sit here quietly in the Opposition and have heard from time to time the bucketing that he chooses to give, no doubt for the purposes of the Press which gives it remarkable coverage, will not be impressed very much by the hindsight which he normally shows as the end of debates. We have now heard the speech which he was going to deliver today and I suppose we should be thankful, but it was an indication in itself that he did not have very much to contribute. He gave us a list of persons he wants to call before the Senate. He talked about the &#39;likely scene&#39;. He does not know what the situation is but the likely scene&#39; is all that he can talk about. </para>

            <para>- I am not defending him. I have been attacking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> for the last 2 days over his activities in regard to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> knows it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> wants to call a number of witnesses, who, he thinks, might be helpful. It is probably in his mind to create the most interesting scene in the Parliament since King Charles came in to arrest a few members. It might be interesting, but what he ought to realise is that the Opposition in this chamber has had long discussions about and had given consideration to this matter.  His  are not the first and last thoughts on this matter which will be very much in the mind of the Opposition so that it can act properly and sensibly whenever the situation demands it. I heartily support the flexibility which is inherent in the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. The problem with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> amendment, and I am afraid this is where he has hoodwinked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> is that it suggests that he wants to include the words - </para>

            <para>- We can overcome that. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> will be happy with the amendment when he hears it but I am not sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> will be because the proposal contained in my amendment was suggested to him and he would not have a bar of it. The amendment which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> has moved seeks to insert the words &#39;for purposes which include the summoning of certain persons to attend as witnesses before the Senate&#39;. I propose the insertion of the word &#39;may&#39; so that the words in the amendment will then read &#39;for purposes which may include the summoning of certain persons to attend as witnesses before the Senate&#39;. If that is accepted, should the Senate be recalled it would be no longer essential to summon witnesses as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall.</inline></para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline>expressed the view that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> amendment did not restrict the recalling of the Senate to that purpose alone. That is quite so. It could be for other purposes. One thing that would have to be included in the purposes&#39; as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> amendment stands is the summoning of certain witnesses. Because that is the only purpose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> can see in recalling the Senate, he wants to include that and make it a compulsory part of the recalling process of the Senate. </para>

        <para class="block">My amendment will put <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> to the test.

If on the other hand he chooses to want to confuse the Senate by hoping that the meaning that must be read into his amendment makes it a compulsory prerequisite to summon people before the Senate then he will reject my amendment. So I propose that we put him to the test. That test will be by inserting after the word which&#39; the word &#39;may&#39;. I hope then that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> amendment will have no fears for the Opposition and will be a satisfactory amendment to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers&#39;</inline> amendment. </para>

          <para>- I second the amendment. In rising to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> &#39;s amendment I would like to remind the Senate that we are considering a motion which would allow the reassembly of the Senate before the normal time and which would allow the Senate to do any or all of the things within its power, including the summoning of persons. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> is aware of that. We have been and we are aware of that option and that possibility. We have neither discarded nor accepted the use of that very grave power by the Senate. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> seeks to impress us all with his usual sanctimonious righteousness I would like to mention that some of us have some very real reservations about the use of the power which he is saying should be brought in. I would remind honourable senators of the BrowneFitzpatrick case, and I would remind them of the very real disquiet which many Australians hadand I was one of them- at that time. I do not deny and have never denied the right of the Parliament to bring people before the Bar of the House. I do not deny the right now, but I would say that at that time I was worried and I was concerned. I have no desire now or ever to give anyone cause to say that the Senate is acting in a way which is abrogating the rights of any citizen. It may be that in calling people before the Bar of the Senate that would not happen, but many people may see that as happening. I would be very upset if in causing the Senate to reassemble we were obliged to use that power. There are some doubts about whether such a move could be guaranteed to be as effective as we would want. I will not canvass that issue, but past experience shows that it is a practice that governments might refuse to allow certain people to reassemble. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers&#39;</inline>amendment is reasonable and broad in its scope. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> &#39;s amendment keeps that breadth. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> is sincere he cannot object to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> proposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> &#39;s amendment will maintain the right to call people before the Bar of the Senate and it will maintain the kind of flexibility which we are seeking. We are as concerned as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> is about the issue raised by the Government&#39;s efforts to raise overseas loans. We are concerned to retain the power to get the Senate to reassemble and we are not prepared to have ourselves limited in the way <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> wants, with his usual assumption that he is the only person who knows how things can be done or what is best for the country. </para>

            <para>-When my friends opposite finish I will be prepared to continue my remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> After the Senate rises the  President  can call an extraordinary meeting only if he sees fit. Provision is made in the law for that. The motion before the House tonight makes provision for a certain number of members of the Opposition to have the same privilege, if they think it necessary, as the  President  has in ordinary circumstances. In my humble opinion the request of the Opposition should not be denied. The events of today make it very apparent to me that the amendment before the House is a very necessary one. But if an extraordinary meeting were convened I would not like to see a repetition of today&#39;s events. It is very important to realise that the convening of the Senate in extraordinary circumstances must be warranted. The Opposition went off half-cocked today. I would not like to see an extraordinary meeting called just to allow the Opposition again to go off in that way. If we are to be reconvened for an extraordinary meeting it is necessary that the conditions be such as fully to warrant the holding of that extraordinary meeting. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Hall</inline>&#39;s statement tonight must be cause for some disquiet. I think that that statement makes it more necessary to have an extraordinary meeting convened than does anything else we have heard either earlier today or prior to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> address tonight. This is the Australian Parliament. We should set the lead in seeing to it that justice is not only done but also appears to be done. Accusations have been made by each side of the House against the other. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> statement tonight makes it very apparent to me that in the course of a day or two there will be such conditions available as fully to justify the calling of an extraordinary meeting. I would not like to be called to an extraordinary meeting for no good purpose, such as the 3-hour debate we had today. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> has suggested that there is evidence to be produced; the Opposition suggested this morning that there is evidence to be produced; and the Government has accused the Opposition of not doing its part. Taking those 3 things into account, I think it is very necessary to have a close look at what is happening. For that reason I am going to support the amendment. </para>

I think that the inclusion of the word is of great advantage. I do not think there should be anybody on this side of the chamber who would deny the substance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> &#39;s amendment. It would retain to this side of the House the capacity in the national interest to supervise the events of the Government&#39;s emergency in the next few days.

If I did not explain the meaning fully when I spoke to my amendment I take full blame for that, but I meant the amendment to stand exactly as it is.

            <para>-Let me explain again to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that I do not believe in taking out of the hands of the Government the arrangements of the sittings of a House. It is a bad principle. I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that we would be starting with a bad principle. To take arrangements of the sittings of a House out of the hands of the Government between major sessions is not a good thing to do in any British parliamentary system. If honourable senators do not like my saying that and think that I am being sanctimonious, I cannot help that. They say things too. Let them not complain tonight about the criticism as though it is all one-sided. I invite honourable senators to come to South Australia and listen to what is said there. Yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> referred to me as Judas. Let us not imagine that the criticism is all one-sided and that I am standing here ladling it out and that none is coming back. I must say that that is a very innocent view that honourable senators from other States have of the politics of honourable senators from South Australia. On that basis, even though I am one against four or five South Australian senators from the Liberal Party, I will have my say and I do not care if honourable senators resent it. That is their business. Now let me get back to the point to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> referred. </para>

            <para>- I will try to be reasonable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> believes in the Westminster system. I put it to him that you do not lightly take the arrangement of the sittings of a House out of the control of a government. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> would agree with the principle that a Parliament must work and the Government of the day must have control of the sittings. There are exceptional circumstances, however, on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and I agreethe Senate may or may not agree with this- when an Opposition which has the majority of numbers could in some state of very great crisis- I did not want to use the word &#39;crisis&#39; but that is the only word I can think of at the moment- convene the House. I am simply expressing the personal view that I do not think the Opposition has the right capriciously to cause the House to meet again to repeat today&#39;s exercise. It would be fatuous to go through today&#39;s excercise again. Yet I feel that that is all that the Opposition may do without some discipline being applied. It is typical of the Opposition to take out of my amendment the mandatory element- that is, that whatever may be the business of the Senate it must include the calling of witnesses- and to insert the word &#39; may &#39;. </para>

            <para>-Senator Missen does not like my criticsm of his amendment. I am sorry that he does not like it. What I am saying is that his amendment is less determinate. I do not know whether I can absolve Opposition Senators from being so sensitive that it regards my words as being sandpaper on their sensitive skins, but I shall use the politest of terms and say that it is much less determinate. It is less definite. It is not definite enough, in my view. Therefore I intend to vote against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> &#39;s amendment. I will vote against the original motion if it includes the word &#39;may&#39; instead of retaining the mandatory element which requires the calling of evidence. </para>

          <para>- in reply- I moved my motion at approximately 10.20 p.m. and it is now almost 1 1 . 1 5 p.m. I have listened to discussion on the three or four amendments we have before us; I have lost count of the number. I have listened to the numerous arguments put forward on behalf of the Opposition and particularly the multiplicity of arguments put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> on a number of the amendments that have been moved. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> said the other day that he felt with three Permanent </para>

I am beginning to think, after listening to the rabble of the Opposition tonight, that we are all sitting in Wirths Circus and that it is about time we all left the place for a while. We have been here for 5 weeks in a row. If being here for 5 weeks in a row does what it has done to the Opposition tonight, it is about time we went away for a spell. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>let me say, notwithstanding anything that might be said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> who moved the first amendment, or by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> who I think moved the next amendment, or by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> who moved another amendment, or by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> who I think supported a couple of amendments, that the simple fact of the matter is that the Opposition is again exhibiting or displaying its numbers in this Senate. It is showing that it is deliberately taking the business of the Government out of the hands of the Government. </para>
        <para>Opposition members say that this proposal they put forward now is exactly the same as that which was put forward by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, the then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> when the Labor Party was in opposition in 1967. But there are variations between the proposal now put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and the proposal that was put by the then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> For instance, in 1967the then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> said: </para>

          <para>For these purposes a request by the Leader of the Opposition shall be deemed to be a request by every member of the Opposition - </para>

        <para class="block">So one telegram sent by the Leader of the Opposition represented a telegram on behalf of all members of the Opposition. But in this proposal as put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> we have a number of choices. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> can send a telegram. If he does not want to send a telegram and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition thinks a telegram should be sent, under the Opposition&#39;s proposal he can send a telegram. If the Opposition is not satisfied with that, the Leader of the National Country Party in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Drake-Brockman)</inline> can send a telegram. If they are not prepared to agree to that, the Whip of the National Country Party can send a telegram. So the whole thing goes on. </para>
        <para>The Senate has been sitting from February until the middle of June. The Senate and the Government can now see the frustrations, day after day, of the legislative programs of a democratically elected and progressive government. All I need to do is to cite the number of divisions that have been called in the Senate in this twenty-ninth Parliament- from July 1974 to June 1975, today- to indicate the frustrations and the show of strength that the Opposition exhibits by sheer weight of numbers in the Parliament. Between July 1974 and 12 June 1975 there have been 236 divisions in the Senate. The Government has won 42 of those divisions and has lost 194 of them. Those divisions do not include the free votes that were taken in relation to the Family Law Bill. The simple fact of the matter is that if telegrams were sent by the Leader of the Opposition, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the National Country Party or the Whip of the National Country Party and we were all called back, we would not be called back for the purpose of discussing Government business. There is no more Government business left on the notice paper to be discussed. We as a Government would not be placing business on a notice paper until 19 August when in normal circumstances the Budget would be introduced. To all intents and purposes, all we would be doing by agreeing to the Opposition&#39;s amendments would be virtually turning the Senate into a star chamber to bring certain unnamed people before the bar of the Senate for the purpose of dragging something out of them. I believe that the Opposition by this series of proposals is again showing its arrogant use of numbers. I believe that the motion put forward by the Government should be supplemented. It is about time we all went home and did not come back to this place until Tuesday, 19 August 1975, at 2.30 p.m. </para>

              <para>Parking </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Current parking arrangements were implemented following the completion of the Senate extensions in 1973. Senators&#39; areas are delineated by parking signs, &#39;Parking Vehicles of Members of Parliament Only&#39;. There are 21 parking bays on the Senate side of Parliament House and these are controlled by Senate Attendants who are empowered to issue parking infringement notices pursuant to the Motor Traffic Ordinance of the A.C.T. It should be noted that Members of the House of Representatives use these spaces as well as Senators. Senators and Members are entitled to use Parliament House car transfers so that their cars may be identified. Senators may obtain these transfers from the Usher of the Black Rod. </para>
          <para>Parking has always been limited around Parliament House and has been a continuing problem. Other than those areas set aside for Members of Parliament, much of the remaining area is reserved for Commonwealth cars. The problem was somewhat relieved by the provision of bays at the rear of the Senate and House of Representatives gardens some 4 years ago. However, recent experience shows that many of these bays are now used by officers from East Block and West Block, and this cannot be prevented as the areas are not under parliamentary supervision. In October 1972, the then  President  of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the</inline> Honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack, had discussions with the Commissioner of the National Capital Development Commission with a view to providing a sealed and well lit parking area at the base of Camp Hill at the rear of Parliament House. On 25 October 1972 the Commissioner of the NCDC was advised that the  President  approved the provision of such parking facilities. This matter was not proceeded with. It is understood that this was because the question of environment was raised. In September 1973, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Magnus</inline> wrote to the Minister for the Capital Territory complaining of the lack of parking facilities in the vicinity of Parliament. The matter was referred to the Minister for Urban and Regional Development for his consideration. At a later date discussions were held between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bryant,</inline> the Minister for the Capital Territory, and officers of Parliament. In the interim, arrangements were made for the area to be patrolled by police officers at night for a half hour after each House rises so that some measure of protection could be afforded to the staff. </para>
          <para>One of the major problems relating to parking in the area around Parliament House is caused by the fact that Parliament is a tourist centre. This means that very often parking space in the immediate vicinity of the House is occupied by visitors. In fact special provision, by way of &#39;limited time&#39; parking areas has been set aside for tourists but this also has been found inadequate. </para>
          <para>I undertake to again raise the matter with the Ministers concerned so that the problems may be overcome. </para>

          <para>Under the Public Service (Parliamentary Officers) Regulations the normal hours worked by Senate staff are hours per week in a week which is not a sessional week and 42 hours per week in a week which is a sessional week. Over a period of twelve months the standard weekly hours of duty of Senate Attendants average not more than <inline font-style="italic">36&#190;,</inline> the weekly requirement of clerical officers in the Public Service generally. During the recess periods of the Senate, Attendants work rotating shifts of 8.30 a.m. to 4.00 p.m. and 9.00 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. During a sessional week they work rostered shifts as follows: </para>

          <para>(The above hours include 1 hour lunch break and a 30 minute dinner break, for which allowance has been made in the totals). </para>
          <para>Overtime is payable for extra duty performed outside the normal hours of duty during recess and session. The above hours, whilst not identical, are very similar to those worked by the remainder of the Senate staff. </para>
          <para>Following representations by Unions, consideration was given to reducing the maximum weekly hours for Attendants to 40. Until recently, generally the Attendant staff preferred to remain on the present rostered hours. However, a recent survey indicates that the Attendants&#39; attitude is now changing. </para>
          <para>Action is now being taken to alter the standard hours worked to 34&#189; hours per week in recess and 40 hours per week in session. </para>
