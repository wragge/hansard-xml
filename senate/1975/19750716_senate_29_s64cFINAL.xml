          <para class="block">I feel I can do no better in opening this debate than to quote the opening words of the Special Report of the Senate Select Committee on National Service in the Defence Force. The Committee was comprised, I think, solely of Labor senators and reported to the Senate in 1951. The report opened with these words: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Parliaments without parliamentary liberties are but a fair and plausible way into bondage. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That quote was from John Pym. The report continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The important truth, powerfully expressed in those words of prominent 17th century statesman, John Pym, may well form the theme of this Special Report- </para>
          </quote>
          <para>May I substitute for &#39;Special Report&#39; the word debate&#39;. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>may I deal firstly with the letters which you read yesterday in the Senate. I make no criticism whatever of the action you took in reading them. They were addressed to you. It was your duty to read them. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President</inline> I do take exception to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> wrongly using the  President  of this place for a Party political propaganda exercise. That is what his letter was. If he had any respect for the Presiding Officers of this Parliament- he has shown in another place that he has not, and he has shown in this place, by his denigration of you prior to  Her  Majesty the Queen altering the order of precedence, that he has not- he should have put that letter down by a statement from the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> in this place. The Presiding Officer in this place should not be used as a mouthpiece for the Prime Minister&#39;s political propaganda. </para>
          <para>How did all this occur? I ask this question: Why did the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister&#39;s staff continually feed out to the media from Wednesday to Monday statements implying that witnesses would be free to answer questions except on matters of policy? It might be said that that was a good exercise in that it was misleading the Opposition. I take no exception to that, but I do not know whether the Prime Minister and his staff ought deliberately to mislead the media, whether they ought deliberately to mislead the public, and that is what they set about doing. Why did they attempt that? They attempted it so that they could pull the cheap schoolboy trick of running an ambush, here at 2.30 p.m. yesterday and from that I totally exonerate the Leader of the Government in this place. I take no real exception to the Prime Minister and other Ministers attempting to gain an advantage by surprising the Opposition. I think it is fair enough for the Prime Minister to do that, for the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> to do that, for the Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> to do that and for the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> to do that. But I ask: Why did the Solicitor-General get into the same exercise? He cannot claim in his letter, which is dated 1 5 July, some special sort of independence and at the same time be a party to a Government ambush. I ask: Why did he not write last week? Why did he not write to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> last Wednesday or Thursday or Friday? Why did he do this at the last minute? The last sentence in his letter states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I have taken the liberty of writing this letter to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> in the hope that you will inform the Senate of it and in the wish that it - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I assume that is the Senate-  may receive prior notice of the position I have felt impelled to adopt. </para>
          <para class="block">That appears at page 2 of the letter. If that is prior notice, it is not the sort of prior notice I ever expected or gave in normal practice. </para>
          <para>The Government now takes a stance as set out in those letters. But what was its stance in Opposition? What did the Government then believe in? May I quote from page 38 of the Australian Labor Party policy speech of 1972, remembering always that part of the Government&#39;s policy when it was in Opposition, and which in fact it carried out, was to repeal regulation 34(b) to free public servants to criticise government policies and actions. On page 38 there is reference to freedom of information. I know it is not Freudenberg at his best, but the Prime Minister did his best with it. Under the heading &#39; Freedom of Information&#39; the statement appears: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Restrictions on public servants will be reduced to the minimum necessary for the conduct of the affairs of government. Excessive secrecy in government is directly related to the fact that the Liberals have been in power too long: they have a lot to hide. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What a paraphrase one could run on that. But the better statement appears on page 9, and this is really Freudenberg at his best. He states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We want the Australian people to know the facts, to know the needs, to know the choices before them. We want them always to help us as a government to make the decisions and to make the right decisions. Australia has suffered heavily from the demeaning idea that the government always knows best with the unspoken assumption always in the background that only the government knows or should know anything. </para>

              <para>-I was not here. I was not a member of the Senate. Ask a silly question and you get a sensible answer. At that stage, of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> was the Leader of the Opposition in the other place. On 8 November 1 967 he moved an amendment to a motion, that the House take note of a statement, in exactly the same terms as the one <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> moved in the Senate, namely, that an officer of the PublicService, the Secretary of the Department of Air, be summoned to be present before the Parliament. I will not give the name of every member of Parliament who voted for that amendment, but I will list the Ministers in the other place who voted for it. They were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bryant; Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> one of the men now claiming privilege; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean,</inline> the new  Deputy  Prime Minister pro tern; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly,</inline> the great parliamentarian down there and the man who runs the Parliament; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Everingham; Dr Patterson:</inline> and one E. G. Whitlam, currently Prime Minister. Who was paired in the voting? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Beazley,</inline> again a great proponent of the parliamentary system; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden,</inline> one of the signatories to the letters; and one Charles Jones, another Minister.

          <para>The Prime Minister had the nerve to say at his Press conference yesterday that what we are doing here is indulging in the politicisation of the Public Service. As I recall the speech of the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Renouf,</inline> he came into the political arena. I do not mind him doing it, but he came into the political area and criticised the policies of the Opposition. I take no exception to this. But if the public servants want to indulge in politics they have to live with politics. They just cannot put their toes in the water and go back home when it gets a little chilly. As to the Prime Minister stating that we should not politicise the Public Service, I ask: Has he never heard of the appointments of Menadue, Wilenski and Spigelman? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> it is all too ridiculous for words. With that, I dismiss the letters. I now come to deal with the motion I moved this morning. </para>

I ask honourable senators opposite: With which, if any, of the 4 paragraphs of the motion do they disagree? Do they disagree with the first paragraph, which states that we affirm that we have the powers and privileges of the House of Commons as conferred upon us by section 49 of the Constitution? Do they deny paragraph 2? Do they deny paragraph 3, which is lifted straight from the opinion of Solicitor-General Bailey which was accepted by honourable senators as a true representation of what they felt? Do they deny that paragraph 4 sets out a sensible and proper method of dealing with this matter? </para>

My question relates to the question of parliamentary committees which he, yesterday, said in answer to the honourable member for Lang has been receiving the attention of the Government and to the practice under which, if a Minister certifies that he regards it as injurious to the public interest to divulge information concerning particular matters, a parliamentary committee accepts the Minister&#39;s certificate and does not require the production of documents on those matters. </para>

            <para>He will probably remember that, in November 1953, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies sent Professor Bland the classic letter on this subject and relied on the 1942 House of Lords case of Duncan v. Cammell, Laird. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether he or his Government has reconsidered this matter in the light of the later decision of Conway v. Rimmer, 2 years ago, in which the House of Lords did not follow its earlier decision but held, in effect, that the body calling for the documents, while giving full weight to the Minister&#39;s view, should itself decide whether the documents should be produced and, for this purpose, will generally be entitled to inspect them? In other words, I ask him whether the Government now takes the view that a parliamentary committee is itself entitled to inspect documents for which it calls and to decide whether it is in the public interest for the documents to be disclosed. </para>

              <para>-Conway v. <inline font-style="italic">Rimmer.</inline> The honourable senator is taking a long time to catch up with me. If it was the right procedure to be followed by select committees and other committees of the Parliament, I ask: What is wrong with the same procedure for the Parliament as a whole? The Prime Minister and the Government in the past used to rely greatly upon the decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> used to quote them tediously. The Prime Minister has always been somewhat addicted to the United States Supreme Court. He rather likes the fact that it seems to be comprised now of lawyers with a social conscience. However, throughout the whole of this exercise, not once has the Prime Minister or any of his colleagues adverted to the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in connection with the Nixon tapes. I think a fair summary of what the United States Supreme Court said is that if Congress wants something there is no such thing as executive privilege. I hope I am not doing the United States Supreme Court an injustice in putting it in those terms. </para>

          <para>One would imagine that what the Senate is indulging in at the moment is something unusual or something strange. Committees of the Senate are but part of the Senate and for at least 10 years public servants have been coming before Senate Committees of all sorts and sizes and on all sorts of inquiries. I ask: When has a public servant ever been embarrassed before a Senate committee in relation to questions that have been asked of him? I and every honourable senator in this place have sat on committees at which very senior public servants have attended and quite often they have said: <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Mr Chairman,</inline> I would like to seek advice on how I ought to answer that question because I think we may be getting into a policy area&#39;. What has always been the decision of the Senate Committee? It has been to grant that request. No Senate committee has been so stupid as to threaten to come back to the Senate and suggest the gaoling of a public servant because he was in some quandary as to whether he was getting into policy areas. Yet the Prime Minister yesterday said in his typical, smart alecky fashion: &#39;I would like to see the Senate attempt to gaol public servants&#39;. It was never in contemplation. I do not think it has ever been in the contemplation of any person who sits in this place. </para>
          <para>The whole exercise indulged in yesterday in the writing of the letters to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> was but a further attempt by the Government to prevent the people of Australia finding out something about the loans affair. The whole operation of the Government, from the time this matter surfaced, has been a cover-up operation. The Prime Minister said yesterday that there are ample procedures in the Parliament for Ministers to be questioned. If one had time to go through Hansard one would see questions unanswered for month after month after month. Questions on the notice paper stay there almost from the beginning of one Parliament to the end of it. Yet the Prime Minister said that there is ample opportunity for members of Parliament to question the Government. In fact there is very little opportunity to question Ministers and there is less opportunity to obtain answers from them. We know, and any fair-minded person will admit it, that on the government side question time is a matter of Dorothy Dixers and propaganda speeches in reply, and on this side questions are asked and no relevant answer is given. That has been the practice in this Parliament for far too long. </para>

              <para>-Of course. I have no objection to admitting that fact. But for the Prime Minister to indulge in the humbug in which he indulged yesterday and to say there is ample opportunity in the Parliament does him no good. This debate and the re-summoning of the Parliament are all part of the continuing story, the continuing saga. It is part of an attempt by the Government to bury the whole of this loans issue and to hope it will go away. But it has not gone away. It will not go away. It will not go away, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> by the Prime Minister&#39;s writing letters to you and it will not go away by the Ministers&#39; writing you letters. It will not go away by the Ministers&#39; telling their public servants to claim privilege on all questions, even when asked for their names and addresses. They have been told to claim privilege about all questions. This matter will not go away.

            <para>- As a result of the Opposition&#39;s resolution of last week the Senate now has before it 2 essential matters: The question of whether the Government has given a full and proper account of its attempts to obtain overseas loans for the development of Australian resources, and now the question of whether the Australian Public Service is to remain a nonpolitical service. I intend to re-state the course of action which has been taken by the Government in respect of the loan matters and to make one or two observations about the appearance of public servants before the Bar of the Senate. However, I shall leave the question of privilege to be argued in greater depth by my legal colleagues. </para>

          <para>The decision of the Opposition to recall the Senate and to proceed on this dangerous course of calling public servants before the Bar was bad enough in itself. The motion which the Opposition now has before the Senate has compounded that situation. Probably never before in the history of this Parliament has a more irresponsible action been taken. It would do us well to recall the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies on this subject. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Civil servants ought not to be dragged into Parliamentary debate. They have great responsibilities which, in my experience, they discharge with outstanding honesty, and it would be deplorable to have their names and views bandied about in Parliament, thus involving the civil servant much against his will in party political controversy. </para>
            <para>Our Constitution and practice are that, instead of having a complete separation between legislature and executive, we have our inherited system of &#39;responsible government&#39;, under which Ministers sit in Parliament after being elected to Parliament, answer questions and engage in debate. </para>
            <para>They are properly responsible to Parliament: their advisers are not. There are overwhelmingly good reasons for this. A political minister must face the music in Parliament: that is his duty and his privilege. He takes responsibility for his department and its administration. </para>
            <para>But a non political officer called before Parliament in relation to a matter of political controversy would be put into an intolerable position. </para>
            <para>Questions put to him would be in the sole discretion of individual members. It would be remarkable if he were not asked for his opinions and the advice he had given his minister. </para>
            <para>He would become a political chopping block. His confidential relationship with his minister would be impaired and perhaps destroyed. He would be irresistibly tempted never to write a memorandum again that he was not prepared to read in print some day. </para>

          <para class="block">But now <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies is disowned, he is repudiated, he is cast aside by the Opposition in this scheme to score off the Government this irresponsible attempt to overthrow ministerial responsibility. </para>
          <para>These words explain succinctly the situation with which we are confronted today. The Opposition believes that the Government has acted wrongly in relation to the raising of overseas loans. It would like to believe that impropriety has been involved. It has, however, been unable to find evidence of any such impropriety- and now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> it is bringing before the Bar of the Senate the Solicitor-General and eleven of the Government&#39;s principal public service advisers in the hope that it might, through some disclosure, discredit by further innuendo, the reputation of this Government. </para>
          <para>On Wednesday last, 9 July, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers),</inline> gave notice of motion to call before the Bar of the Senate the Solicitor-General and 1 1 senior officials that it wanted to answer questions upon the activities of the Government&#39;s Ministers, servants and agents relating to all dealings by them prior and subsequent to the Executive Council Meeting of 1 3 December 1974 which authorised the Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> to borrow a sum not exceeding US$4,000m. They were to be required to produce all documents, files or papers in their possession or control relating to these matters which have not been tabled in the Houses of the Parliament. Attendance before the Bar of the Senate was to be waived in the event of the Government announcing prior to 1 5 July 1975, its intention to appoint a royal commission with proper and adequate terms of reference to investigate and report on all aspects of the Government&#39;s overseas loan activities. 1 made it clear during the debate on the Opposition motion that the Government did not support the proposal. It is now claimed by the Opposition that the Government did not vote against their motion. </para>

I indicate that we do not agree with the course of action which is being taken. Wc do not believe that the Senate chamber should be turned into a Star Chamber before which many people of high repute in the Public Service will be dragged. 1 believe that it is an action which demeans the Senate, and I think it will be embarrassing and probably degrading to the people who will have to be involved. We regret that that course of action is being taken but there is very little that we can do about it. </para>

          <para class="block">Just how cynical the Opposition&#39;s motives really are is best demonstrated by their introduction of this resolution in this House less than 5 hours after the Prime Minister and the Minister for Minerals and Energy had tabled a substantial number of papers in the Lower House- ninetyseven in all- and even before I had tabled them in this House. One might be excused for thinking that the Opposition was saying: &#39;Do not confuse us with facts, our minds are made up! &#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> the letter you have received from the Prime Minister and have read for the benefit of all honourable senators indicates clearly and simply why the Government has determined that although officials should respond to the Senate&#39;s summonses by attending, executive privilege should be claimed for them. </para>
          <para>The inquiry by the Senate in relation to which the summonses have been served is in essence an inquiry into Government policy and decisions of Government. It is not an inquiry into the working of the Public Service or an inquiry into the activities of public servants. It would be inevitable that the inquiry would attempt to go into the extent to which the officers were involved in the formulation of the Government&#39;s policy and decisions- policy and decisions which are the responsibility of the Government and individual Ministers. It is an inquiry that cuts directly across the principle of Ministerial responsibility, a cornerstone in our Parliamentary system. In keeping with that principle, an official does not formulate policy nor is he responsible for that policy or the decisions taken by the Government. It follows that he should not be asked in this place or elsewhere to express personal opinions on Government policy or to make known the views he held and expressed to the Government on any proposed Government action. His role is as an adviser to the Government and this has been made abundantly clear in the statement of the Prime Minister that I read to the Senate last Wednesday evening. Let me remind the Senate of those words from the Prime Minister&#39;s statement. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is no secret that the Treasury had reservations about my Government&#39;s intention to authorise the Minister for Minerals and Energy to investigate loan raising overseas in the terms of the Executive Council authority. I freely admit that fact, which apparently has become known to the Opposition and the electorate through the leaking of documents. In the event, we took the advice of other departments. In saying that we did not accept the Treasury reservations, I make no apology, as I make no apology for the Government&#39;s original concept of borrowing extensive petro dollars for capital development. Nor should I. It is an arrogant suggestion that a government, whatever its policies, should be frustrated in its decisions because of any bureaucratic opposition. </para>
            <para>Is there any real challenge to this view from the Opposition? Certainly there was none when it was in government. </para>
            <para class="block">If it needs support, I need go no further than the 1968 Garran oration by the former Governor-General and former Minister of the Crown, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Paul</inline> Hasluck, who examined very closely the proper relationship between advisers and Ministers. There are numerous other authorities such as those quoted by the Solicitor-General in the memorandum incorporated in today&#39;s Hansard. This reaches to the heart of the matter- the real origins of this present controversy. Our decision had political objectives, it was a decision about policies. </para>

          <para class="block">The action that the Government has taken to instruct the officers summoned by the Senate not to attend is not without precedents. In 1 95 1 the then Acting Prime Minister, the then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fadden,</inline> took similar action to prevent the Chiefs of Staff from attending before a Senate Select Committee on National Service in the Defence Force. But there are substantial differences between the situation we have today and that applying in 1951, when a courteous invitation was issued to the Chiefs of Staff to attend rather than the peremptory summonses that were issued last week. Then there was no disclosure. Here there has been full disclosure. One might have a little more sympathy for the Opposition&#39;s tactics if it could be genuinely claimed that the Government had been secretive in this matter. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the Government&#39;s record. It answered some 69 questions without notice that were asked between 31 October 1974 and 12 June 1975-37 in the Senate and 32 in the House of Representatives. Of 7 questions placed on notice, 6 have been answered and the seventh, asked of the Minister for Minerals and Energy by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> on 1 1 June will be answered as soon as possible. There was an urgency debate in this House on 12 June 1975. The Government freely and fully participated in that debate and, I believe, answered the Opposition&#39;s charges. The basic facts in this matter were, as a result of answers given by Ministers, well known to both senators and members alike. Indeed it could have been argued that there was no need for the Government to recall the House of Representatives on 9 July. Nevertheless the Government took this action and in the course of debate on that day some 97 documents were tabled by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Minerals and Energy- documentation that was tabled by me on their behalf when the Senate resumed its sitting at 8 p.m. that day. The full text of all of those documents is available in Hansard. </para>
          <para>In the course of proceedings in the House of Representatives on 9 July the Leader of the Opposition tabled a series of 44 questions, and all of these will be answered. Similarly the Leader of the Opposition has requested the tabling of certain documents and a response to this request will be given when the House of </para>
          <para class="block">Representatives reconvenes on 19 August, although I must add in this context that, in respect of his request for certain Executive Council minutes relating to loan negotiations, the information sought was provided in response to a previous question on notice from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline></para>
          <para>It is clear that the non-government parties in the Senate have by no means fully tested this matter through the normal and proper parliamentary procedures available to them- in debate, in questions and, if necessary, in urgency motions or even no confidence motions. The Parliament was recalled so that the parliamentary procedures could apply. What the Opposition proposes is a procedure essentially foreign to normal parliamentary practice, untested on the scale and in the manner envisaged in the history of the Senate, untested in any respect at all in over 20 years. </para>
          <para>I make plain the Government&#39;s view that what the Senate is seeking to do is to avoid the normal and proper procedures of the Parliament to obtain through officers of the Public Service information and documents which should be sought from Ministers. In taking this course, the fundamental character of ministerial responsibility is challenged. It is the Government which must decide, weigh and take decisions on advice submitted by public servants. It is the Government that will answer in the Parliament any request or any challenge put to it. It is the Government- not the bureaucracy- that is responsible to the people. This is in accord with the principles on which our democracy is based. The Opposition is attempting to substitute this chamber for ministerial decision. If these principles are successfully challenged, government would become unworkable. </para>
          <para>In the Government&#39;s view, the real intention of the non-government parties in the Senate by the course of action they seek to impose is to avoid the normal and proper procedures of the Parliament. The Government, on the other hand, has given a full response in the Parliament to the rumour and innuendo that have characterised the debates on overseas borrowings. The Government has not declined to answer questions put by the Opposition. It has not declined to produce papers sought by the Opposition which by standards acknowledged on both sides of the Parliament it would be proper to produce publicly. </para>
          <para>Before concluding my remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I wish to refer briefly to the reference in the resolution that the calling of senior public servants before the Bar of the Senate has arisen from the Government&#39;s failure to appoint a royal commission. The Government would, if there were sound and compelling reasons, appoint a royal commission. But what are the grounds? The Government&#39;s purpose was to pursue policies in the interests of Australian control of Australian resources. The proposal was economically sound. Legal advice was obtained from the Government&#39;s legal advisers before the Minister for Minerals and Energy was given authority by the Executive Council to proceed with negotiations for the loan. Proper care was exercised with the assistance of the Government&#39;s legal advisers to ensure that the intermediary in this matter would have no claim against the Australian Government. The Australian Government was protected at all points in connection with the proposed borrowing. Proper checks were made on the bona fides of the gentlemen involved. Not a cent has been paid or will be paid to the person concerned. There has been no impropriety on the part of the Australian Government. There have been no breaches of the law. Australia&#39;s international reputation as a government with prime borrowing status remains unchanged- remains as high as it ever has been. Why then should the Government appoint a royal commission? The answer is clear. There simply is no need for a royal commission. </para>
          <para>In closing my comments I say that, notwithstanding the arguments one way or the other that will apply in this debate, this is a sad day for the Senate, for the Parliament and for Australian democracy. All political considerations aside, and no matter which Party is in power, this situation should never arise again. We, as a Senate, have a responsibility to prevent it arising again. I hope that in the future the Parliament will have sufficient common sense to ensure that the Public Service of this country will not be subjected to the sort of indignities to which it is subjected today. </para>

            <para>- The prepared speech which has just been read by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> ignores the vital issues contained in the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> The issues before the Senate are not the issues to which the Government would like to limit the debate. The Government has asserted that it has given to the Parliament and to the people all that it- the Government- believes the people ought to know, but the Senate believes that it should have further information. The Senate disclosed that it wanted that further information when it affirmed last Wednesday that certain members of the Public Service should appear before it. To that request by the Senate the Government has given a blanket direction that no questions are to be answered and no documents are to be produced and that the public servants are to claim privilege. The Government has challenged the power of a House of the Parliament. The Executive is seeking to place itself above the power of Parliament, representing the people, to seek information which the Government has declined to provide. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The importance of the issue as to whether the Executive can override and withstand the rights of a House of the Parliament to obtain information which it wants is at the core of what we are debating, and that is an issue which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> has by-passed. Parliament and parliamentary authority are under a challenge today as they have not been for many generations. Outside the Parliament there are those who would tear down the institution. Within the Parliament there are those who would subdue it and denigrate it so that it becomes merely the servant of an all-powerful Executive. We in the Senate have a challenge before us on this occasion to assert that there are rights which parliamentarians can exercise and, with a sense of responsibility, should exercise as occasion demands. This is a right which is inherent in the parliamentary system which we have inherited from Great Britain. Under the Constitution the Senate has the powers, immunities and privileges possessed by the House of Commons at the time the Commonwealth was founded. What were those powers? I refer to what was said by an English Judge in 1845 as to what those powers of the House of Commons were. It is a well-known statement which I think ought to be remembered in 1975. It reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That the Commons are, in the words of Lord Coke, the general inquisitors of the realm, I fully admit: it would be difficult to define any limits by which the subject matter of their inquiry can be bounded: it is unnecessary to attempt to do so now: 1 would be content to state that they may inquire into everything which it concerns the public weal for them to know; and they themselves, 1 think, are entrusted with the determination of what falls within that category. Coextensive with the jurisdiction to inquire must be their authority to call for the attendance of witnesses, to enforce it by arrest where disobedience makes that necessary, and, where attendance is required, or refused, in either stage, of summons or arrest, there need be no specific disclosure of the subject matter of inquiry, because that might often defeat the purpose of the examination. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That constitutes the power of the House of Commons then as today. It constitutes the power which the Senate possessed in 1901, then as today. If this Parliament, if this Senate, abdicates the functions and the powers and the rights which it possesses to get information in the public interest then it shall be doing a fateful disservice to the institution of Parliament itself. </para>
          <para>This is not the first occasion on which this issue has come before the Senate. It came before the Senate in the form of a report from a Senate Select Committee in 195 1. It was an issue for debate in the Senate, precluded only by the fact that a double dissolution of the Parliament occurred and the debate was not resumed after the election. It is well known by those who have studied this question that the issue is unresolved, that it is an issue which could from time to time arise and require resolution. I wish to refer to what is said in paragraph 65 of the special report of that Committee, a document already adverted to by my Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> As I say, it is a report of a committee which was comprised of Labor senators. Paragraph 65 reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The action of the Government in directing Commonwealth officials not to attend to give evidence before the Select Committee was clearly calculated to defeat, hamper and obstruct the purpose which the Senate had in appointing the Select Committee. This action revived, in the crudest possible way, memories of the old struggle between Parliament and the Executive. The history of that struggle, and the result, should have been in the minds of members of the Cabinet when they adopted their dictatorial attitude. The Committee can do no better than quote the following words of the present Prime Minister of Great Britain (The Right Honourable Clement Attlee), who, speaking in the House of Commons during the <inline font-style="italic">Sandys</inline> case, said- </para>
            <para class="block">There can be no greater blow to democracy than the admission of any right of the Executive to hamper, hinder or restrain members of this House from carrying out their duty to the nation. The freedom of members from pressure by the Executive was fought and won years ago, and it must be defended against attack even if that attack should be cloaked under anxiety for the national safety. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is what we are about today. I know that there are those who would claim that the power of the Executive is a power which overrides all who would seek to question. Regrettably that appears to be the basis upon which the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> has based his case today. I think those who argue that case in this chamber have an enormous responsibility because they are asserting the right of the Executive over the right of the chamber of which they are a member. The view that the Senate has a complete power to require information, both in practice and in theory, is unquestioned. The existence of that power has been widely acknowledged and there are few who would challenge it. We know- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> referred to the instance- that in 1951 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fadden</inline> as the Acting Prime Minister directed certain persons not to appear before a Senate committee. However, it should be remembered that preceding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fadden</inline> &#39;s statement <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies as the Prime Minister had replied to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna&#39;s</inline> request on behalf of the Committee that the particular chiefs of staff should appear before that Committee and had indicated not that they should refuse to attend but that in matters of giving opinion there were difficulties in public servants expressing opinions on government policy and therefore he doubted whether there would be any value to the Committee in hearing from those chiefs of staff. That is a far different position from asserting that a person shall not attend before the Committee. </para>

              <para>- I take up the point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> It was a different issue, in any event, from the issues with which we are concerned here. I assert that the power of the Senate is a power which, in theory, is unlimited and which, if it is to be limited in practice, is to be limited having regard to the circumstances in which the request is made, having regard to the efficacy of other means of securing the information which is sought and having regard to the importance to the Senate and- -to the nation of securing that information. </para>

          <para>There are, of course, certain inquiries which have taken place in regard to this whole question. I am well aware that reference has been made to a document which has been tucked away in the archives for the last two or three years and which was prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> and myself during the lifetime of the previous Government. It has been misused in the conclusions which have been sought to be drawn from it, because it is a document which raised for discussion and consideration a number of possibilities. What that document states is that there are practices in the United Kingdom, there are practices before the courts, there is a practice in the United States of America and there is a practice within Australia under which claims which are made by the Executive in the name of privilege- to refuse to answer questions or to produce documents when requested. by a House of Parliament or by the courts or by litigants before the courts- are to be dealt with, and it is a question- this was one of the aspects the paper was concerned to consider-which ought to be clarified in the interests of greater certainty. It is a pity that over the 2V4 years the Government has been in office it &#34;has not sought to take some action in an area where there was already a basic document suggesting lines along which further inquiries should take place. I refer to one paragraph of that report to indicate the vital issue with which the authors were concerned. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>At the threshold the question could arise as to whether the House should accept as conclusive the certificate of a Minister or should adopt a system similar to that now adopted in the Courts, namely that the House or committee, in relation to some classes of documents or evidence, not obviously privileged, should look at the documents or consider the nature of the evidence for the purpose of determining whether or not it is in the public interest that they bc produced or the evidence given. An alternative course would be to submit to a Court the question whether Crown privilege should be upheld in a particular case. </para>

              <para>- 1 ask the Minister to look at the succeeding 2 paragraphs after the next one. The whole point is that what we are concerned with here is a situation which has been produced by the failure of the Government to provide answers to vital questions which have been asked persistently not only in the Parliament but also outside the Parliament and in respect of which the Government has set up a brick wall. We have asked, through the Opposition in the House of Representatives and in this chamber, that a royal commission or other form of judicial inquiry be instituted so that the facts can be ascertained. We believe that a royal commission is the desirable means of achieving that end, because a judge or judges who would comprise that commission would bring that accepted legal ability to sift what is relevant from what is irrelevant, to analyse evidence, to give due weight to what people have said and to give it the relevant importance and overall to apply that objectivity which is the characteristic of a judge going about his business. That is what the people of Australia need, it is what the people of Australia should be given; but this Government has refused to give to the people that sort of inquiry. We acknowledge that the exercise upon which we are embarked is second best, but it is the only course which is available to us, and we desire to ascertain further facts. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>What does the Government do? It simply says that there is to be a claim of privilege by every person who is summoned to appear before us. How valid is that claim of privilege to be regarded? I think that if the letter which the Prime Minister sent to the  President  and the letters which the Ministers sent to the  President  are acknowledged the pattern becomes clear: The Prime Minister is simply setting out what he has instructed his Ministers to do, and it is the Ministers&#39; letters which are the relevant letters. All that the Ministers have said is that they have directed officers of their Departments &#39;who have been summoned to appear before the Senate to claim privilege in respect to answers to all questions upon the matters contained in the Resolution of the Senate and in respect of the production of all documents, files and papers relevant to those matters&#39;. </para>
          <para>So what the public servants have been asked to do when they are asked a question is to claim privilege. It will be interesting in due course to hear what the witnesses actually say. Will they use the words: &#39;I claim privilege&#39;? What will they say if they are then asked: &#39; What is the ground of privilege upon which you are relying?&#39; One would hope that they would state what is the ground of privilege because what we in the Senate believe is important is that at that stage, knowing what the claim of privilege is, we should be able to say whether or not it is a sound claim of privilege. The Opposition in the Senate will act responsibly, and I have no doubt that the whole Senate would act responsibly, in not taking the view that there is a public interest which would require the withholding in some cases of some information. But the important thing which the Senate must assert is that it will determine whether or not the claim of privilege is a valid claim which should be upheld. That is the position which the courts maintain. </para>
          <para>Prior to 1 968 and the famous case of <inline font-style="italic">Conway</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Rimmer,</inline> to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> referred, there was an attitude in England, though not in Australia, that if a Minister gave a certificate that it was against the public interest to produce a document which someone wanted in the course of a court hearing, the courts accepted what the Minister had said. They did not inquire as to whether it was a proper certificate and whether it was proper in the public interest that those matters be not revealed. In the name of Crown privilege or in the name of the public interest, vital information was often withheld. The House of Lords, with that bold move which it is capable of achieving from time to time, said that the past law was too restrictive. It has laid down the case, which subsequent judgments have confirmed, that whenever a Minister says that it is against the public interest to produce information it is for the judge to decide, on an examination of the documents if necessary, whether or not that claim is to be properly made and upheld. </para>
          <para>I will not go into the judgments which I have here because that would take time. The fact is there; it is unchallengeable. What we say is that the Senate should not place itself in a position with regard to the Executive which is a lesser position than that which the courts adopt. If in this House a claim is made that there should be a withholding of documents, the ground for withholding the documents must be explained, and it is for the Senate to make that decision. That is the position in the courts. One could remember something of more recent history. I refer to the case of President Nixon in the United States who claimed confidentiality for certain tapes and records of conversations which he did not wish to reveal. The District Court in the United States had said that if the special prosecutor wanted those tapes he was entitled to have them; and the United States Supreme Court unanimously decided that the District Court was right. I quote from the judgment of Chief Justice Burger. He said:   . . neither the doctrine of separation of powers, nor the need for confidentiality of high level communications, without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances. </para>
          <para class="block">But we are talking today about the claim of the Whitlam Government that it, without more, can claim in all circumstances a complete immunity from answering questions or producing documents to a House of the Parliament; and that is a position which the Senate will not maintain. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline>I have made the claim publicly and outside the privilege of the Parliament that what has been disclosed so far prima facie represents criminality. There has been an attempt by unlawful means to subvert the Constitution, to by-pass the Parliament and to raise, so that one might govern without Parliament, $4,000m. Most lawyers know what <inline font-style="italic">Halsbury &#39;s Laws of England</inline> says as to the meaning of conspiracy. It says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>If two or more persons agree together to do something contrary to law, or wrongful or harmful towards another person, or to use unlawful means in the carrying out of an object not otherwise unlawful, the persons v*5 so agree commit the crime of conspiracy. &#39;**&#34;\ </para>
          </quote>
          <para>What is happening in Australia at the moment is of far greater significance than what happened to President Nixon in the United States because the enormity of people in government raising billions of dollars without telling the Parliament and indeed without telling their fellow members of Cabinet, and using that as a means of subverting the Constitution and by-passing the Parliament, is criminality in the highest degree. There is a prima facie case, a suspicion if you like, which ought to be answered. It is not answered by a Prime Minister saying that nobody has made any charges of criminal conspiracy or of illegality when I have made such charges and the newspapers in some States have carried them. </para>
          <para>When that situation exists is a Senate, or either House of the Parliament, to sit mute and to accept that those persons against whom these charges may be made will use the fact that they have a power which they claim to be an executive or Crown privilege to withhold information from the Senate? We have in this case a motion which first affirms the powers of the Senate. Will the Government vote against that? Secondly, the motion states that it is for the House of the Parliament, upon just claims of privilege being raised, to decide upon those questions of privilege and that subject to the determination of those claims it is the obligation of witnesses, persons called before the Senate, to answer those questions. To use the words of a former distinguished Solicitor-General, the mere fact that a person is a departmental officer is in itself no ground or basis for refusing to answer questions. </para>
          <para>The matters which are to inquired into are matters vital to the performing by the Parliament and by each House of the Parliament of the matters with which they are charged. We are engaged in an exercise of high constitutional import. Irrespective of what might be the apprehensions or what might be the implications extending into the immediate or the long term, when great issues have to be faced, they have to be faced. We are facing a great issue now. I believe that the Senate will not flinch from the task which it must perform, and that is to assert its right as a House of the Parliament in 1975 to do what other Houses of Parliament in the English tradition extending back over the centuries have done- resist the power of the Executive and resist it responsibly and in the public interest. That is what we will be doing. </para>

He has certainly given ample evidence here today that there is a great deal that he needs to know. For example, he said that nothing was unusual about what is happening here today. I challenge the Opposition to cite one instance in the history of this Parliament where an officer of the Public Service has been summoned to give evidence on any subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> remains silent. Is there nothing unusual about that, Senator? I would say that it is one of the most unusual events in the life of this Parliament. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline>also took it upon himself to challenge me, as the Minister representing the Attorney-General in this place, to state whether, on the matter of Crown privilege, we relied on the well known case of <inline font-style="italic">Duncan</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Cammell, Laird</inline> or whether we took as our authority a case which he found difficulty in pronouncing, that of <inline font-style="italic">Conway</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Rimmer.</inline> I assure him that there is an even more recent authority in the person of somebody who sits beside <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> on the benches here today. I refer to none other than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> who has treated us to his customary display of righteous indignation. I would have thought that an honourable senator who set for this country the high standards which he elaborated today would have set himself a rather high standard in quoting from his own work. In dealing with this very matter of <inline font-style="italic">Conway v. Rimmer,</inline> which lays down new legal standards about Crown privilege, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> cited a paragraph from the book which he coauthored with a present member of the House of Representatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> a former SolicitorGeneral. He cited paragraph 146 which comes immediately before a paragraph which gives an answer to the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> I will quote paragraph 147 which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> did not see fit, for all of his moral righteousness, to cite to this House. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> to listen closely in order that he will know the attitude of his colleagues on the matter of Crown privilege. </para>

              <para>-&#39;The file should not be presented&#39;. We are well aware of the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies which has been referred to by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt),</inline> and I think there is no necessity to cite it. One thing which is particularly interesting about the claim for privilege in relation to the VIP aircraft matter, about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> was very eloquent- I will remind him of his words a little later- was that it was not some matter of the defence of the country, it was not some large matter of public interest about which one would have expected that there should be any concealment. We are accused today of being less than honest in not being ready to produce all documents relating to a major matter of state, a matter of extensive loans which the Opposition considers to have been totally unwarranted. The Liberals claimed privilege, in no uncertain words, on a matter of producing documents concerning the use of VIP aircraft. Was that a matter of more far reaching state importance than the matter which we are discussing today? Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies and all the Liberals claimed that that matter was a matter on which it would be quite unwise to bring the permanent head before the Senate. What sense of proportion is there involved in a change of attitude like that? </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline>I suggest not quite as honestly as one would have expected from a man who proposes to be a Simon Pure, referred to a previous case when the Senate Select Committee on National Service in the Defence Force, which was comprised solely of the Labor Party members, invited various officers of the armed Services to appear before the Senate. It wrote to the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> attempted to find some comfort in the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies did not say in a blanket way that they should not give evidence. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> said that he did not think it would be of much use if they were asked to comment on Government policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> attempted to distinguish that from the stand which the Government has taken in this matter today. However, with the selective type of quotation to which he is evidently addicted, he did not go on to tell us what the then Acting Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Fadden, said when this matter was followed up by the Committee- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies having gone abroad. Prime Ministers went abroad even in those days. So I will read to the chamber the full text of the reply of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Fadden which, I suggest with respect, puts a rather different light on the attitude of the Government of the day to that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> attempted to convey to this chamber today. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Fadden wrote: </para>

            <para>It is quite impossible to draw the line between what your Committee may call factual and what is policy and it should not be for any official or for the Committee, in the view of the Government, on matters which may touch security, to decide whether it is either one or the other. </para>

          <para class="block">That, I would have thought, would be a fair enough principle for us to rely on in this debate.

          <para>Seeing we have got into the field of quoting legal cases I should like to refer to a couple of recent comments made in cases in this country- a little closer to home than the House of Lords. Perhaps they will have some persuasive influence on the great Australians opposite. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Lanyon Pty Ltd v. Commonwealth of Australia</inline> the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Menzies in the High Court of Australia upheld a claim of privilege in respect of documents falling within a certain class, namely:   . . documents brought into existence within Government departments and instrumentalities for consideration in formulating a submission to Cabinet and recommending a decision of Cabinet, its committees or sub-committees thereon. </para>

            <para> It is that the Government process directed to obtaining a Cabinet decision upon a matter of policy and Cabinet s decision upon that matter should not, in the public interest, be disclosed by the production of Cabinet papers, including what I would describe as papers which have been brought into existence within the governmental organisation for the purpose of preparing a submission to Cabinet. Such papers belong to a class of documents that in my opinion are of a nature that ought not to be examined by the court except, it may be, in very special circumstances. </para>

          <para class="block">I would suggest that the above observations would apply equally well to deliberations of the Executive Council. </para>

          <para class="block">So if we are to rely on the law I suggest that the law and opinions on the law by learned lawyers like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> are all on one side.

          <para>The notice of motion given yesterday by the Opposition was given belatedly after some confusion. It was given after the Opposition claimed it had been ambushed. That was a very curious claim. One would have thought that one of the possibilities that would have been envisaged by an alert and competent Opposition was that the Government would take the position that it has taken in the light of all the authorities which should be dear to the hearts of honourable senators opposite. The motion which has been moved deserves a little examination. In paragraph ( 1 ) it states: </para>

            <para>That the Senate affirms that it possesses the powers and privileges of the House of Commons as conferred by Section 49 of the Constitution- </para>

          <para class="block">I point out to the honourable gentlemen opposite and especially to the lawyers in their ranks that it is a matter for the Parliament to declare its privileges under section 49 of the Constitution. If they take the trouble to read the section they will find that it is not for the Senate alone to declare the privileges of the Parliament. The Parliament has not done so in any relevant way. </para>

              <para>- But my comment, in case <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> does not understand, is that it is not for the Senate to affirm its rights, privileges and immunities. It is for the whole of the Parliament to do so, and until it has done so there is no point in a pious resolution like this. Paragraph (2 ) of the motion reads: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>That subject to the determination of all just and proper claims of privilege which may be made by persons summoned, it is the obligation of all such persons to answer questions and produce documents. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I should point out that that paragraph denies the existence of any right in the Executive Government to make a general claim of privilege in relation to any subject matter of inquiry. Read it closely and it becomes obvious that it bears no other meaning. Indeed, it denies the right of any Minister to make a claim of privilege and asserts that the claim may be made only by a witness. Now, a witness may be a relatively junior man in the service and yet have come into possession of secret information of great importance, say a defence secret, in respect of which a claim for privilege certainly would be allowed if it were made. But paragraph (2) would forbid a claim of privilege in that case. Nowhere has it ever been suggested, apart from this resolution, that a claim for privilege must be asserted only by the witness. The privilege is the privilege of the Executive Government, of the Crown, to have its affairs kept secret, and the duly appointed agents of the Crown, having a right to address the Senate, must be entitled to submit to the Senate a claim of privilege. Paragraph (3) reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That the Tact that a person summoned is an officer of the Public Service, or that a question related to his departmental duties, or that a file is a departmental one does not, of itself, excuse or preclude an officer from answering the question or from producing the file or part of a file. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">My comment is that the Government asserts that the very fact of a witness being an officer of the Public Service is important in itself and must be recognised as important for the purpose of a claim of privilege. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and individual responsible Ministers have claimed privilege in this case based on principles of responsible government, principles which, as 1 have shown, have been adhered to, preached, written about and boasted about by representatives from the other side of politics for years and only belatedly disowned for opportunist purposes here today. I submit that if the Senate can go behind the Ministry and seek evidence of the Ministry&#39;s activities from the advisers to the Ministry then responsible government is undermined. I am supported in that proposition by a very learned quote from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> which I will produce a little later. As I said earlier, the Opposition can cite no example of a public servant having been summoned to appear before the Senate. </para>
          <para>I think it is significant also, as the Press has had a mention in these proceedings, to note that the newspapers which have lambasted the Government over the past couple of weeks about the loans matter generally- notably the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review,</inline> a newspaper for which I have a great deal of respect, and the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> one of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> favourite newspapers which I think he would have to admit has not been kind to the Government over this matterboth have editorialised in the last couple of days upholding eloquently the principle which the Government seeks to uphold here today. But perhaps I can go to no more eloquent exponent of the position the Government is putting than the honourable senator, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> who has been curiously silent today, even forbearing from his usual penchant for interjection. I should like to remind him of a couple of passages that appear in the Hansard of 1 November 1967, when the VIP debate was being conducted in this place. There are a couple of matters there that are quaint, ungrammatical, but redolent of the familiar brand of indignation which we in this chamber have come to expect from the upright, honourable and learned senator. </para>

That amendment was debated and was passed with the support of 4 Liberals- unlike those who are caged in the Caucus trap- and the Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party. The 4 Liberals were <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford, Senator Lillico, Senator Wood</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator R.</inline> C.

I say that because on 1 November there was a motion before the Senate to suspend Standing Orders to take advantage of the absence of a Minister and to bring on a matter precipitately and before it would come on in due course of proceeding. What I said then was that I believed that a matter of this sort should be considered with much more deliberation and much more thought.

            <para>- I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers&#39;</inline> motion, which is before the Senate, because I believe it is the only logical next course of action he could take. There are many questions as yet left unanswered. I think that the rule that one could run over the whole loans matter, which is an embarrassing one for the Government, is this: Is the question largely satisfied? 1 find, in looking at it and in reading the information available inside and outside the Senate, that the question is far from satisfied. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is no satisfactory conclusion to the question as to where the Loan Council stands and where the State Premiers stand in relation to their rights in regard to the Government&#39;s intention to borrow money from overseas. It is all very well for the Federal Government to say that the indebtedness of Australia is minimal. The State governments basically carry the debt of Australia. They have every right to know when the Government is going to introduce new and major loan borrowings as it intended to do from overseas. The matter of &#39;temporary purposes&#39; and just what those purposes were is by no means outlined in any of the answers given by the Government. In a third question, there is no answer as to who will benefit individually from the allocation of these loans. This is something that has not yet been dealt with properly. </para>
          <para>The questions are unsatisfied. The Government has claimed that it has given all the answers it intends to give. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland said on television last night that the members of the public have been told all they need to know. In the face of that attitude, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> is showing an unusual amount of logic today. I have much pleasure in supporting his motion because most certainly the matter will not rest here. Does the Government believe that simply by denying further information to the Opposition and to the public, which is thirsting for it and which is being led by the media to obtain it, it can close the books? It cannot. </para>
          <para>This is an evolving situation. The Parliament has been tried and the Ministry has not answered. This is the second major attempt to obtain information which so far has not been available. If the Government is able to frustrate this move, something else will happen. If I were in the Opposition&#39;s position I would adjourn the Senate until 1 January next year and let the people decide in the meantime. Something will have to be done to find out just where the Government is culpable or where it is blameless, because it will not say. The Opposition&#39;s position is, of course, somewhat difficult. As I have said, it cannot let the matter rest here. It will be the Government&#39;s responsibility- I have no doubt that it will be the Government&#39;s responsibility- if the Opposition is forced into further action to obtain the information that it desires. </para>
          <para>I think that the matter of privilege which has been dealt with, of course, by the lawyers of the Senate and is to be dealt with further by the legal members of the Senate is something which could be settled happily by compromise under the motion put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> It would be a matter of qualified privilege. I am sure that the Senate would not try to force any questions which were the subject of privilege as between the Government and its advisers. In fact, by the very rejection of penalties it has given away the ability to enforce answers to such questions. The Opposition has made it clear that it does not desire to enter into that area of confidentiality which is paramount in Government administration. But it also has made it clear that it wishes to know what is proper and what has taken place in regard to certain communications which should take place automatically. The question of where the Loan Council stands is a matter in particular which could be satisfied by questions in the Senate. </para>
          <para>The question of innuendo has been raised. I suggest that the Government has fostered the unknown, the rumour and the innuendo by its failure to answer. As a South Australian senator I have been particularly interested in the frequent references to the Adelaide contacts. This is not about some of the other fanciful matters which have brought about the demise already of one Minister or about those matters which have been dealt with in truth in some other publications; it is a reference included in the documents tabled in this House by the Government and deals with the loans which the Minister was so urgently and in some cases so humiliatingly seeking. </para>

              <para>- Yes, indeed. I would be happy to furnish names and have those people called before the Senate in a private capacity to indicate who made those threats and have the matter out here where the innuendo will be ended. I take that no further at this moment. However, if that is the level to which this great discussion about the $4 billion loan is to be taken, if that is one aspect of it, it must certainly conjure up the vision of some funny money. It is not good enough for the Government to say: &#39; We close the books. We have told the public all it needs to know&#39;. That is what the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> has said. It is not the case. The questions are largely unanswered. The major questions are unsatisfied. We have to know the answers. </para>

          <para>I will be sorry if when this motion is passed, as I believe it will be, the result is not satisfactory. I will be sorry if the witnesses are not able to come forward and give selected answers according to their view as to what is confidential between them and the Ministers and what is pertinent to the general inquiry which the Senate is conducting, which, of course, would be the case. If that does not take place I can assure the Government that the public and, I assume, the Opposition, although I cannot speak for the Opposition, will not be satisfied and will take it further. What is the use of delaying this matter? What purpose is the Australian public served by carrying this on for weeks and perhaps difficult months with people involved as they have been in all directions and with Ministers losing their jobs over it? What is the purpose, for the proper administration of government in Australia, in the Government&#39;s denying in a blanket fashion all evidence before the Senate from its public servants? One can only assume that there are matters which the Government would find very embarrassing indeed if they were outlined in this House; not that they are matters simply of confidential advice from its advisers. They are matters which will reflect gravely on ministerial responsibility. This being the case I have pleasure in supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers&#39;</inline> motion. </para>

            <para>- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> rather flattered me in implying that I was going to speak on the law of privilege. I am afraid that as a practitioner that was a field in which my practice was not very extensive. In fact it was non-existent. My long suit was breaking, entering and stealing, which probably also has relevance to some of the discussions we have been having here today. In the practice of breaking, entering and stealing one tends to confine oneself to the facts rather than to the law, as one learned magistrate in the city of Perth often used to point out to counsel when they raised questions of law. I therefore would like to try to draw us back, in a spirit of some common sense, to what it is we are trying to do today. I think that what we need to do is to find out what the Opposition is trying to do. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have given a great deal of my time, in fact about 5 per cent of it, to studying the various accusations that the members of the Opposition have been making about loans and so far what I have seen paraded for me has been a cast of characters who are certainly exotic, some may say picaresque. In fact they almost sound like the passengers in Agatha Christie&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Murder on the Orient Express.</inline> We have had references coming from the various journals and the members of the Opposition to an assorted group, including a dentist who also is the  president  of a football club; a Pakistani who apparently lives and transacts business in a basement; a man who it appears changed his name and claims to have been a member of the secret service of one or more countries; a person who has been described by the Premier of South Australia as a certified lunatic; another gentleman with a Hungarian name who also has been certified, but this time by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bunting of whose ecclesiastical status I was hitherto unaware, as a good Christian, and the Saudi Arabian authorities were informed accordingly; a number of knights of the realm; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Phillip</inline> Lynch. We have heard about all these people and they have all done various things. They seem to resemble in some ways the Flying Dutchmen of the jet age, constantly flying from Zurich to Melbourne, to Tokyo and to New York, sending telexes and swearing affidavits. A most industrious group they are indeed, but what precisely it is that they are doing or are alleged to have done remains a mystery to me. I must say that I think the onus is on the Opposition to tell us what they have done and what the accusations are. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline>has told us that he has said inside this Parliament and outside this Parliament- with great courage, he tells us, and I do not want to dispute <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> courage; I would be the last to do so for I remember the role he played in the Vietnam war- that he believes there has been criminality. Criminality committed by whom? Who was the individual who engaged in these criminal actions? It is not very heroic to say inside or outside the Parliament that someone has committed an act of criminality. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> believes that someone has committed a criminal act let us hear from him who the criminal is and what his criminal act was. It is completely useless just to say: &#39;I believe there has been some criminality&#39;. </para>
          <para>We have heard the same sort of thing from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall.</inline> I dare say that he found last Friday&#39;s expectations were not satisfied on Saturday&#39;s results but I would think that even in this state of disappointment he should give a little more attention to some of the matters he has brought before us today. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> has told us that he has heard that someone has been threatened by someone else, which is a very serious matter if it is true, and that the way to resolve the problem is to bring public servants before the Bar of the House. Apparently he thinks that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt and other distinguished citizens will be able to shed some light on this problem which suddenly has been brought to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> attention. </para>
          <para>I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> that if he has information about threats being made to some individual by another individual who is also unspecified with regard to these loans or any other matter the Bar of the Senate is not the place to deal with them. The place to deal with such matters is the Adelaide Police Court. If it is a criminal offence a charge should be laid there and it will be dealt with there, not here. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> that he immediately takes steps now that I have given him that legal advice which is the only legal advice I intend to offer anybody today. Instead of wasting his time talking about these matters here, he should immediately see his solicitor. Possibly his State Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Millhouse,</inline> would be able to advise him on this matter. He should arrange for a summons to be issued from the Adelaide Court of Petty Sessions where the matter would be clarified almost immediately without the presence of all these First Division public servants and Second Division public servants who are sitting around today watching this extraordinary performance which has been going on all day before them. </para>
          <para>How did we get into this position? Apparently we got here because the Government refused a motion which had been put by the Opposition. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Killen</inline> is in the gallery and I can see his embarrassment at this dreadful procedure. The Opposition put a motion that a royal commission be appointed with proper and adequate terms of reference to investigate and report upon all aspects of the Government&#39;s overseas loan activities. What nonsense is this! If there is to be a royal commission or a judicial inquiry, there needs to be at least a clear prima facie case of illegal conduct or improper conduct. We have not heard such a case. We have heard innuendoes. We have heard people&#39;s names bandied about, but there has not been one allegation. There has not been one substantive motion moved by anybody in the Opposition. To have a royal commission, one has to lay charges and the royal commission has to investigate these charges. Honourable senators opposite talk this nonsense about a royal commission into all aspects of the Government&#39;s loan activities. Since when? Dating back to when? </para>
          <para>Do honourable senators opposite suggest that we should have officials of the Australian Treasury coming into the Parliament, divulging confidential information accumulated over the years with regard to foreign loans which have been entered into or which the Government has attempted to enter into without any specifics being given of the matter which is under consideration, other than the innuendoes about somebody being threatened, somebody living in a basement and somebody changing his name which really do not have any bearing on <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler or the other distinguished gentlemen who are associated with him? Of course not! This is absolutely preposterous! If this sort of thing continues, before we know where we are we will have private secretaries coming along and making statements about their Ministers. </para>
          <para>I think the Parliament ought to set itself quite resolutely against the practice whereby the Parliament is allowed to go on a fishing expedition against members of the Public Service, forcing them to divulge confidential conversations which they have had with their Ministers because the result of that will be a total breakdown in government. Does anyone seriously suggest that a Minister should not be able to have a conversation with his permanent head about the competence of various officers in the Department, about how he is getting on with another department, how things are going with the Public Service Board or the Treasury or somebody else? Surely it is proper that such conversations should take place. But how can such conversations take place if the position is to be that the permanent head or one of his subordinates may find himself summoned before the Senate and, under duress, forced to disclose to the Parliament and to the public, private conversations concerning the conduct of his Ministry which he had with his Minister. This is what the Opposition is attempting to do here today. I am still waiting to hear charges from honourable senators opposite. I have not heard any specific charges at all. I have heard innuendo after innuendo. </para>
          <para>I must say that I am surprised that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> of the Liberal Movement- a Party with 2 seats in the South Australian House of Assembly- should come here today and raise this slander directed against nobody in particular, but everybody connected with the Government in general, that somebody has been threatened. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> wants to name them, let him name them. Let him stand up, if he wishes to make a personal explanation on this matter, and name the people who made the threats. But let him not hide from that course of action by saying merely that somebody has threatened someone. If the person who made the complaint to him has a complaint, why does he not go to see the police instead of the time of the Senate being wasted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> on that matter? In passing, I refer to one of the more sensible members of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton.</inline></para>

I only said &#39;one of the more sensible members of the Opposition&#39;. If we look back to the year 1972, shortly before the collapse of the defunct Government which preceded us, a debate took place in the Senate concerning Jetair Australia Ltd. It was one of those scandals which crop up every now and then. I must confess that I do not remember precisely what the problems of Jetair Australia Ltd were. It is rather like the Chowilla Dam; I cannot remember what side I was on. Looking back on what happened with respect to Jetair Australia Ltd, we find that when this matter was being discussed a question was asked of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> who was then Minister for Civil Aviation, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt. Senator Wriedt</inline> asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> whether he would give an assurance that all his departmental files relating to Jetair would be tabled as, if this was not done, information necessary to forming a proper picture of the role of the Department of Civil Aviation in the Jetair affair would be withheld from Opposition senators who would be inhibited in their capacity to ask specific questions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> with very great commonsense, answered: </para>

              <para>-Senator Wright tabled all the files without motion from the Senate requesting that action. It ought to be remembered that, despite the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> failed to secure passage of a motion seeking to suspend the Standing Orders to enable him to move to have tabled the files relating to the VIP flights, those files were tabled voluntarily. </para>

          <para>Talking of the VIP files reminds me of the debate which took place in the Senate on 1 November 1967 on that topic. I refer to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> as reported at page 1962 of Hansard of that date. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> will be delighted to know today that I read his speeches, especially the ones from the past. </para>

Which paragraphs of my motion do honourable senators opposite reject? Do they really say that the Senate ought not to be the master of its own house? 1 know that within the Labor Party it is quite common for members of the Caucus to be but division fodder for the Executive. If that is the role that they wish to play in the Parliament they can do so, but we are not prepared to play that role. 1 can remember powerful speeches in this place by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> when he was in Opposition. He has even made them in Government when we have been discussing the Standing Orders. I think it has always been a contention of his- it certainly was contended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy-</inline> that the only rights the Senate will ever have are the rights which it asserts, upholds and demands.

          <para>The Government has put up no argument as to why the motion which we have put down should not be agreed to. I think it is time we came to a vote on this matter. There have been 3 speakers from each side. Speakers from our side have fully canvassed the arguments. On the other side there has been the usual attempt to cover up. There has been the lack of will and of desire to come to grips with the motion. One senses- I put it no higher than that- that honourable senators on the Government side are but laggards dragging along behind the Prime Minister&#39;s chariot, doing his bidding but not enjoying it. For them I have great sympathy. I believe that our motion is correct. It puts down quite properly in the constitutional, legal and parliamentary sense the way in which the Senate ought to operate.

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>the simple reason I have moved this motion is this: Some comment has been made about the place that the Senate would be conducting this examination along the lines of that concerning Fitzpatrick and Browne. Nothing has ever been further from my mind and, I think, from the Government&#39;s mind. If witnesses are called to this place they should be treated with courtesy and, as we do in our Estimates Committee hearings, they should be invited into the Senate and should be able to be seated. The Standing Orders of the Senate, which were designed many years ago, really were not used in the examination of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson in 1931.I think it is fair to say they are not up to date or altogether satisfactory. I put to the Senate- and I am always open to argument and to persuasion being the reasonable man I am- that these rules may not be the perfect answer. However I think the motion would be of benefit to the Senate and would be of benefit to the witnesses. As I see these proposed rules there is no political advantage for either side. The motion relates to a set of rules designed for the more orderly conduct of the Senate. </para>

              <para>- I might have great difficulty in convincing the honourable senator as to what those words mean. I remember the famous speech he made in the Senate once when he spoke about scabs. If that were the honourable senator&#39;s sense of justice and fair play he just has no sense of it. I remember the honourable senator quoting that great speech of Jack London and I think the honourable senator was even prepared to indulge in the death penalty for such persons. I would be wasting my time explaining to the honourable senator because he has no sense. </para>

I have no doubt in my mind that the Leader of the Opposition was completely sincere in his remark that he does not wish to create embarrassment to any member of the Australian Public Service. I hope that every other honourable senator will adopt the same principle and respect the public servants as individuals. The question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is obviously related to the resolution in the same way as I felt the previous one was related. I hope, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that you will rule that the principle has been properly established. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick,</inline> as the first witness, has indicated his position- that he is acting under a direction of his Minister- and has indicated his intention not to answer any further questions. I believe it is proper that that authority should be respected, and I believe that he, as a witness, should be respected as from now. </para>

As I understand it, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler can give us information as to whether the loan program is a public document or is not a public document. It may be that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> will have to claim, according to his instructions, that he is not to admit to the existence of a public document or to comment on what the public document contains.

I also will include a question specifically directed to that document which was tabled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> appearing in House of Representatives Hansard of 9 July at page 3613. 1 shall ask <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> whether that is an authentic document. It purports to be a Treasury statement on unsolicited offers of overseas funds. We will then see what the loan program consisted of during the relevant year and what Treasury instructions were. Then there will be questions with regard to the proper legal control of those funds according to the knowledge of the Secretary of the Treasury. They are all objective questions, the answers to which I require to know for an assessment of any matters that may arise out of these proceedings. </para>

In replying to the point of order raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland I want to recapitulate the situation that existed at the time that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> was excused from the Senate.

There was no substantive motion; it was just a suggestion. I expected that a motion would be forthcoming to discharge <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> or to excuse him and then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> asked his question. After the suggestion was made there was no motion forthcoming from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> I think that now we have recalled <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick,</inline> after excusing him, the option is open to him to reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> Then I would expect, rather than a repetition of something of this kind, to hear something substantial from the Leader of the Opposition. That would be after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has asked his question. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr President,</inline>I rise on a point of order. It is apparent that the Government is using the tactic that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler will not even be allowed to be asked the questions. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> has said, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler has indicated that he is well seised of what his Minister has said and that he is prepared to obey his Minister. That is the first step in Government intimidation of the Senate. Now, before questions relating to public documents on the record can be asked of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler, the implication becomes well known to Government senators as to the absurdity of the breadth of the prohibition which has been imposed. That, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I submit is the real reason behind the objections which are being taken. I respectfully submit that notwithstanding how many points of order are taken by Government senators, the ruling you have made is the proper ruling. I also submit that senators are entitled to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler questions and that if he proposes to claim privilege and object to answering them that is his prerogative. But it is not for Government senators to stop the questions being asked. </para>

With respect, I say that one cannot ask a relevant question of a chair for example, unless one is certifiably insane, because the chair will not answer.

              <para>-Not this question, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> I think you are under a misapprehension. This is an entirely new question and it relates simply to the public document relating to the loan program which has not been referred to in the evidence or the files or the proceedings. I suggest that when the Senate is inquiring into the overseas loan raising activities of the Government, it is not within <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick&#39;s</inline> direction to refuse to answer all questions relating to those matters before and after the minute of the Governor-General in Council of 13 December. My question now relates to a program from June to June, a public document and the amount of money included in the loan program for Commonwealth purposes. If <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> goes to the point of claiming privilege for that, it will be an illustration of the extremity to which the Executive Ministers are going to preclude witnesses from performing their normal duty of answering questions of fact. This is a question of public fact, non-controversial and, I would think, known to any junior officer of the Treasury. </para>

              <para>- I am rising on the point of order that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland addressed himself to, that is, the relevancy of this and every other question. Whether a question should be put to a witness must stand the test of relevancy. I might ask a question outside the overseas loans matter as to whether something happened. Would that question be relevant to the matter now before the Senate? The witness was called to answer questions only in relation to the resolution of the Senate. That resolution concerned the question of overseas loan negotiations. I might want to know the amount involved in 1971-72 in respect of Australian Government borrowings. What value would it have? There will be no end to this examination if we allow irrelevant questions to creep into these proceedings. This would be contrary to the purpose for which the witness was asked to attend the Senate, to appear before it, and on which he was asked to prepare answers. </para>

It was debated and ruled out of order. It is a question of relevancy as to whether questions about the loan estimates for 1974-75 have anything to do with the resolution to call witnesses before the Senate to answer questions. It was decided during the examination of a previous witness that the matter had no relevancy and I do not know why the honourable senator has attempted to ask the very same question of a subsequent witness. </para>

              <para>- It is a point of order. The resolution of the Senate refers to overseas loan transactions before and after 13 December 1974. Loan transactions by the Commonwealth for the year June 1974 to June 1975 include the matters to which the Senate&#39;s resolution is directed. It is impossible, I submit, to take the view that the loan program, so far as it refers to loans for Commonwealth purposes for that full 12 months, is irrelevant to the subject matter of the Senate&#39;s resolution. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I ask you so to rule. </para>

              <para>- I wish to speak on the point of order, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> I have raised this point on 2 occasions before, and on both occasions you have ruled the question out of order because the event happened before the thirteenth of some month. I also have some queries about 1928. I am not satisfied with the loan raising then. Is that within the ambit of the resolution? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> you have given a ruling on the same question on two previous occasions and for the matter to be brought up as a point of order at this stage is canvassing your previous ruling. This is quite contrary and detrimental to the standing orders. I think it is not befitting for any honourable senator to canvass the President&#39;s ruling in this House. </para>

Perhaps I was precipitate in ruling that way, considering that there were questions to follow, but that question to a man of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox&#39;s</inline> standing appeared to me to be frivolous. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> if you wish to continue your series of questions I would like you to do so. </para>

              <para>-I take a point of order. It is quite apparent that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is determined to get some publicity out of these hearings today. We started off this sitting of the Senate in, I thought, a fairly sensible way, with the purpose of respecting the rights of individuals who are brought before the Bar of the Senate. That would never satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> It never has, and it never will. I suggest that the questions which he is asking now are turning the hearing into a farce. They are not relevant to the matters contained in the resolution which we agreed upon when we commenced proceedings. If they are not relevant they should be ruled out of order. </para>

            <para>- I rise on that point of order. The position which has arisen now is different from any other points upon which you have had to rule, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> because <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt has answered the last 2 questions without claiming privilege or relying upon the Minister&#39;s instruction. One does not know how many further questions may be asked of him to which he will respond. I think it is significant that he is answering questions. I can understand the concern of the Government senators who have been raising points of order all afternoon. They want to stop this particular line of questioning because it is obvious that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is embarking upon a series of questions as to the knowledge which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> has of the Loan Council. The purpose may be the relevance of the Loan Council&#39;s activities to fund raising. The financial agreement under which the Loan Council was established requires that all loans shall be raised by the Commonwealth. The question may well be relevant as to whether the Loan Council was ever asked, let alone informed, that the Commonwealth coolly intended to raise something like  $4,000m.  My submission is that while the witness is answering questions these attempts by government senators to shut out the answers ought not to be regarded as anything other than a further attempt to intimidate the Senate. </para>

They being questions of a formal nature, I submit he was entitled to answer them.

              <para>- I wish to raise another point which applies not only to this witness but to all witnesses. I do not think witnesses should be asked questions not within their sphere of activities, of which one would expect them to have great knowledge. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt is called as a witness before this Senate as the Secretary to the Department of Minerals and Energy. We know that he has held that position since 1 972. Whilst he has stated that he had some 18 years experience in the Department of the Treasury, he is not now a Treasury official. He was asked a question which was not asked of the Treasury officials whom one would expect to have the answer and to know the answer. The Opposition is hoping to get a particular answer from someone not associated with the Treasury but with another role to play. </para>

          <para>We would expect that some 3 years ago <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt would have known the answer to the question about how often the Loan Council meets. One could forgive him if today he did not know how many times a year the Loan Council meets at present. Anyone would excuse him if he could not answer that. But the officers whom we could expect to know and who have been called as witnesses were not asked the question. The particular question has been asked of one who at this stage is not an expert on the question. That indicates that the Opposition is trying only to manufacture the answer rather than to get facts out of the witness. I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> to see that all questions referred to a witness are questions in relation to the particular occupation that justifies that witness being called before the Senate. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline>Hewitt,  With respect, it is not really within my present knowledge and I therefore cannot answer the question with the certainty that the answer I give would be correct. If I may, I should like to elaborate on that a little and also elaborate on what I said a moment ago. I was asked a direct question about the length of my experience at the Treasury and I answered Thirteen years&#39;. I perhaps should have answered an unasked question, the answer to which would be that, with the exception of the periods in which I acted as Secretary of the Treasury, at no time when I was in the Treasury did Loan Council matters form part of my responsibilities there. If I may further say, I answered the 2 previous questions because, as a lay person quite untutored in the law, I thought they were formal questions and believed them to be formal questions. If I may add one more word, with the greatest and deepest respect, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I think that this epitomises the problems that a lay person and a person who is not qualified in the law faces when he is in a court of justice without the representation that is there provided to him in the form of counsel. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline>Hewitt, With respect, my answer is really the same as the previous one. I cannot from my present personal knowledge and recollection give an accurate answer to that question. If I may illustrate my problem: I cannot recall, for example, whether it is the Treasurer of Australia or the Prime Minister of Australia who is the  Chairman  of the Loan Council. Consequently I cannot go on of my own knowledge accurately to say at this moment that it is the Treasurers of the States or the Premiers of the States. Indeed my recollection of being in attendance at Loan Council meetings is that they have all participated, but I cannot without counsel and consideration answer that formal question. </para>

A resolution of the Senate having been passed last Wednesday and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> having read certain letters yesterday concerning that resolution of last week, a further resolution was passed today. So I put it to you that it is part and parcel of what the Senate passed on Wednesday of last week. It flows out of that resolution of last Wednesday which led to your reading those letters yesterday afternoon. The resolution passed this morning flowed out of that. So, there is a direct connection between the 3 events. </para>

            <para>-On the point of order, it would be hard to imagine a more specious argument than that which has just been advanced by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers).</inline> How can a resolution passed today by this Senate, subsequent to the issuing of these summonses, be connected with a full and accurate account of the activities of the Government&#39;s Ministers, servants and agents relating to all dealings by them prior to and subsequent to the Executive Council meeting of 13 December 1974? It is impossible to link the passing of the resolution today with the matters mentioned in the summons.

He has received also, I would suggest, directions by this Senate as to its rights, powers and privileges. I want to know whether the witness does intend, in the light of that resolution, to continue with his refusal to answer questions. Therefore, I say it is relevant to ask whether he is aware of this resolution and whether he, as a lawyer, regards the first part of it as being true and within his knowledgewhether he accepts it. </para>

I did do a report at the request of the Prime Minister and that was published, but the fact that I have done that does not seem to have any bearing upon what my obligation is. </para>

              <para>- I seek a decision of the Senate relating to witnesses who have today been examined and excused from attendance. The resolution of 9 July provides that witnesses shall attend the Senate from day to day until the Senate otherwise orders. I suggest to the Senate that it should consider a motion discharging the witnesses, providing that their further attendance is not required. Such motion, of course, would not include <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitelaw</inline> whose attendance has been only postponed. </para>

              <para>- That is correct. I am reminded that if there is no specific motion the witnesses will be required to attend tomorrow morning. If there is a motion at the conclusion of the examination, they are all discharged, but up to the present time none of the witnesses has been discharged. They have just been excused from being present in the Senate. Are there any further questions? There being no further questions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Byers,</inline> you are excused from your presence in the Senate. </para>

            <para>In view of the evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr R.</inline> J.

In accordance with longestablished principles, I direct you to claim privilege in respect of answers to all questions upon matters contained in the Resolution of the Senate and in respect of the production of all documents, files and papers relevant to those matters. Furthermore, I direct you that, if the Senate rejects the general claim of privilege made by you, you are to decline to answer any questions addressed to you upon the matters contained in the Resolution of the Senate, and to decline to produce any documents, files or papers that may be in your possession relevant to those matters. </para>
            <para>This direction does not, of course, apply to answers to formal questions that may be addressed to you by the Senate. </para>

Under section 72 (b) of the of the Public Service Act, an officer granted leave under the section is an unattached officer of the Australian Public Service during the period for which he is granted leave. Under the same section, upon the termination of the leave, the unattached officer has a right to be appointed by the Public Service Board to an office in the Australian Public Service of appropriate status. The leave is granted by the Public Service Board. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitelaw,</inline> therefore, is part of the Australian Public Service in accordance with sections 10 and 72 (b) of the Public Service Act. </para>

          <para>The directions that have been given by the Treasurer to officers of his Department, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitelaw,</inline> dated 15 and 16 July 1975, directed the officers to claim privilege in respect of all questions upon the matter contained in the Resolution of the Senate. This point was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler in his evidence and he indicated that he would observe the direction not to answer questions on that basis. A claim of privilege is made by or on behalf of the Minister, not the individual officer. The direction given on 16 July is in essence a direction to claim privilege in respect of all questions and the production of any documents. The correct person to make that claim in relation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitelaw</inline> is the Minister within whose jurisdiction the relevant questions and documents fall. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitelaw</inline> was summonsed as an officer of the Treasury. He answered the summons as such. The material in relation to which he could possibly give the relevant evidence consists of matters under the jurisdiction of the Treasurer. The Treasurer therefore has rightly directed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitelaw</inline> to make the claim of privilege and to decline to answer questions or produce documents on that basis. </para>

              <para>-The Minister for Labor and Immigration will appreciate that we are looking at this matter on the run. The Leader of the Government in the Senate has been kind enough to show me his copy of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland has just said. A couple of problems have been raised which I would like to take into consideration. I put them to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland so that he may have notice of them and perhaps give further consideration to them. </para>

          <para>The first is that the claim of privilege is being made by the Minister. Yes, that may or may not be true. But the nub of the matter, it seems to me, is: As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitelaw</inline> is no longer an officer employed within the jurisdiction of the Treasurer- and the statement does not appear to have adverted to this point, unless I have overlooked it- who can now give instructions to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitelaw,</inline> if he is on the unattached list? Can the Treasurer so instruct him? Is the only person who can now instruct <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitelaw</inline> the  Chairman  of the Public Service Board, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitelaw</inline> is not under any ministerial authority? As I understand it, if he is on the unattached list he is not subject to direction by any permanent head. I understand that permanent heads of departments have certain authorities over officers under their control or under their supervision- I do not know what is the correct term. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitelaw</inline> has now moved to somewhere out of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler&#39;s direct supervision, control or authority. 1 put these questions purely so that the Minister will see what is exercising my mind. Without going into the merits or demerits of the fact that the Treasurer is claiming privilege, what right has he to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitelaw</inline> is not to answer questions? </para>

              <para>-I do not quite see how the Treasurer gets that authority. I can quite understand the situation in which the Treasurer writes to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler and gives him a ministerial direction, because he is the Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> is the departmental head. I can quite understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler most likely would have the authority, even if the Treasurer did not have it, to so direct all other officers within that Department. But how does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> address enforceable instructions to a person who is not within the Department of the Treasury? I do not want it to sound as if I am arguing nothings. I think this is important. </para>

          <para>I indicate that I would like the Minister to take these points on notice. As we all know, the Senate is to rise at 6 o&#39;clock tonight. In order to save time, I point out that in a moment or two I will seek leave to move a motion to discharge all witnesses except two- one would be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitelaw</inline> and the other would be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Byers-</inline> so that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland can give me further advice in the morning on the problems I have raised. As it is almost up to the witching hour, it might be better to get that advice to me in the morning. If the Minister can show that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> has the power, then of course <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitelaw</inline> ought to be discharged forthwith. </para>

        <para class="block">Attached to the letter are 2 copy affidavits, one by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bray</inline> and one by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Moxon.</inline> I have read them with interest and concern. I have ascertained to my satisfaction that the actual affidavits have been sworn, though I am in no position to verify the authenticity or the truth of the matters contained in them. I think they raise matters which warrant the attention of persons concerned with justice in the industrial movement and with seeing that right is done. The material discloses that a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brian</inline> Harradine, who is well known throughout this country and, more particularly, in the Government Party, has been the subject of what is an alleged frame-up of enormous proportions. That is verified in the material which is contained in the affidavits. </para>
        <para>My purpose is to seek the attention of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> and of the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> so that the matters contained in these affidavits are investigated. It would be a shameful affair if, simply as the result of a frame-up, a union office bearer were suspended from his office and therefore lost the rights which are conferred by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Act to have financial assistance to enable him to test in the courts the validity of his suspension. That is the allegation which he makes. It also ought to be a matter of public knowledge if prominent union officials in this country are engaged in activities which amount to concocting untrue evidence with which to ruin a person&#39;s political fortunes in any political party. That appears to be the gravamen of what is contained in these affidavits. I have no wish to read these affidavits in full, but if it is desired I shall do so. I seek leave to have the affidavits incorporated in Hansard. </para>

Ray says there would be no worries about any come-back against you because your statements would be used only at an ALP Federal Executive inquiry and unsworn statements would suffice. All you have to do is say you were present at a meeting between Harradine and myself. I will say that I was the one who did all the talking and made all the arrangements. You will only have to say that you heard him tell me that he would give us money and support. And you have got to stop Norm Bray from trying to get a copy of my statement from Ray&#39;. I said: Frank, how can you go on lying about some bloke you have never even met?&#39; Shanahan said: &#39;He deserves it anyway. 1 know a lot more now than I used to. It&#39;s been explained to me that he is a danger to the Labor Party&#39;. I reported this conversation immediately to Norm Bray. </para>

              <para>Egan rang me next. I believe this was on or about Monday, 14 April 1975. Egan said: &#39;1 spoke to Ray Gietzelt on the weekend. Ray says if you are really sincere about making a statement and getting the writs off you Ray is prepared to settle for one dollar and an apology. You will give him any vague unsigned statement. You can come into my office and get it typed up and I will give it to Ray myself. He will send back to me an unsigned corrected copy indicating what he wants to see in it. If you agree to that you will meet him the day before the ALP Federal Executive meets and you will both exchange signatures. You will sign the document Ray wants and he will sign something withdrawing the writs&#39;. I said: &#39;I do not like it. I do not trust him.

        <para class="block">PHOTOCOPYING FACILITIES AND THEIR USAGE AT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT CENTRE- 12th FLOOR OPERATIONS ROOM </para>
        <para class="block">My dear Minister, </para>
        <para>Several days ago my secretary Marian Grace in her usual mood of generosity undertook a photocopying assignment in behalf of the Executive Officer of the Ethnic Radio Committee of which I am a member, this Committee being created at the joint action of the Ministers for the Media and P.M.G. It may well be said that either of these two Ministeries could take carriage of such clerical tasks associated with the committee operations and to explore that possibility the two responsible Ministers are being given a copy of this communication. </para>
        <para>Notwithstanding this aspect I refer to the current and future policy which does and will in the future apply to photocopying facilities at the 12th floor in Sydney. What I take strong objection to is the interference of the authoritarian minded secretary of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> Carrick attempting to browbeat 12th floor Public Service staff to claim a priority of service for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carricks</inline> wants. In all the time I have had recourse to such facilities I accepted without demur the policy of first come first served. </para>
        <para>To put it bluntly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carricks</inline> secretary should have done what my staff always does wait until an earlier parliamentary client has his wants completed. </para>
        <para>If what I suspect this obscure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator and</inline> his stand-over type secretary are claiming that the phoney title of &#39;Shadow Minister&#39; merits special treatment let me say in the words of the Prime Minister &#39;it &#39;s just not on &#39;. </para>
        <para>My various committee functions including re-appointment to the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council would certainly refute any ideas some people, even some of your officers might have, that Shadow Ministers rate ahead of Government Senators who are non-Ministers. </para>
