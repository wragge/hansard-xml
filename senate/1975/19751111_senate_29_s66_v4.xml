            <para>- These people are mentioned in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barron&#39;s</inline> book, and I think most people know that. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kulakov,</inline> head of the Department of Foreign Relations of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Academy of Sciences, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr V.</inline> A. Kouzin,  deputy  chief of the Foreign Relations Department of the U.S.S.R. State Committee for Science and Technology, were to have arrived in Australia this morning, 1 1 November, to represent the U.S.S.R. at a review commission under the Australia-U.S.S.R. Agreement on Scientific and Technical Cooperation. It is well known that the U.S.S.R. employs a significant number of intelligence officers in its various official institutions, particularly those with responsibility for foreign contacts. However much we may deplore this practice, this Government, like all governments which have entered into the normal range of relations with the U.S.S.R., accepts that it is inescapably bound to work from time to time with Soviet officials with intelligence backgrounds. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Messrs Kulak and Couzin hold appointments within USSR Academy of Sciences and State Committee for Science and Technology which are directly relevant to the work of the Review Commission to consider co-operation under the Australia-USSR Science and Technology Agreement. The applications by Messrs Kulak and Couzin for visas to visit Australia were naturally considered against the background of what the Government knew of their KGB connections. It was decided to accept their nomination by the Soviet authorities on the basis of their present positions in the Soviet scientific bureaucracy, in which capacity they have paid a number of visits to other Western countries in recent times. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kulakov</inline> I understand, has been to the United States, France and Austria since the beginning of 1974. I imagine his duties for the USSR Academy of Sciences have also taken him to other countries, but I do not have comprehensive information about his movements. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kouzin,</inline> of course, was in Australia last year for the initialling of the science agreement between Australia and the USSR. I understand he also visited Canada recently. Their visit of one week&#39;s duration was to have been taken up with negotiations and meetings with senior Australian officials. We have just received a message from our Embassy in Moscow that the USSR authorities have informed the Embassy that the delegation to the meeting will not now be coming because of, and I quote from the telegram, &#39;the situation in Canberra &#39;. </para>

            <para>- It must be obvious to anyone that the program which the Government has announced in broad outline is of necessity complex because it involved the great bulk of the Australian banking system with all its complexities. I can only restate what I have said in previous answers to questions, that is, that the Government is committed to act constitutionally and legally and to seek the necessary parliamentary approval for whatever may be involved in the scheme that it has in mind. As to any alleged delay in the announcement of details, I do not think that that for one moment suggests any insuperable obstacles are being encountered. It is important that before any such scheme is implemented the banks are quite clear on the details of such a scheme, and I am quite sure that the banks themselves would want to be. I anticipate that the arrangements will be the subject of an announcement in the very near future. </para>

          <para class="block">Barraclough either is not informed or is purposely putting out false information. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Morrison,</inline> in a statement to the Parliament on 26 August, pointed out that the recommendation to the Government to abolish school cadets had come from the Defence Force Development Committee which represents the most authoritative source of advice on defence matters to the Minister. The Minister said that the Committee had formally advised him that abolition of the school cadets would have no adverse effects on capabilities but would release Service manpower for other purposes. This view was endorsed by Major-General Pearson, who recently retired as Chief of Army Personnel, at a seminar in Brisbane on 1 September. He said it should not be the responsibility of the Services to maintain cadets and drain defence expenditure. It is the view of the Chief of the General Staff and the Military Board that the $ 1 1 plus allocated to cadet training can be more effectively used for the defence of Australia in other fields. In relation to allegations that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Range had misled the Government, I repeat that the advice to the Minister from the Defence Force Development Committee was unanimous and included the views of all its members, namely, the  chairman  of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Admiral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Victor</inline> Smith, the 3 Chiefs of Staff- Vice Admiral Stevenson, Lietenant-General Hassett and Air Marshal Rowland- and the secretary of the Department of the Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Range. </para>

Unfortunately the position may become worse, particularly in the new year. One of the problems in Timor on the humanitarian side is that the planting of crops has not taken place and that people have consumed some of what would be the seed for crops. 1 certainly commend the appeal. I add my voice to an appeal to the Australian people to be associated with these people in raising money for humanitarian purposes. </para>

It is true that in that report it was recommended by the Committee that a museum of history of aviation in Australia be established at Albury-Wodonga. I tell the honourable senator that, from the large number of letters which have been received by me and by my Department on this subject since the report was made, it is obvious that there is great public interest in the matter. The Government will give consideration to all aspects of the report. As I have said, it has already attracted considerable publicity. I am well aware of claims by Queensland for a national aviation museum. Queensland has a proud record in the history of aviation in Australia. I have arranged for my Department to convene an interdepartmental committee to study the contents of the report before I submit recommendations to Cabinet. I am sure that the interdepartmental committee which has been established will take note of the points made by the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- I think the short answer to the question is yes. Of course we did anticipate that if the various repatriation tribunals were going to be giving reasons for their decisions, of necessity that would take longer than if they were merely giving a decision without stating reasons. That was taken into account by the Government and by veterans organisations when they advocated to the Government that that principle ought to be introduced. It is a principle which is of advantage to applicants and to appellants. These tribunals are of a judicial nature and I think everyone would agree that it is only fair that those people who receive a decision from them should know the reasons for that decision. Both the repatriation boards and the appeal tribunals are now taking longer than they took previously, as we anticipated they would. Other factors apart from the giving of written decisions are causing certain delays, such as maintaining the availability of medical officers to give medical opinions. We are finding a certain reluctance as the years since the war roll by on the part of medical practitioners to agree to act as repatriation medical officers. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Inquiries also are taking longer because of the time that has elapsed since the wars. It is now much more difficult to establish whether a disability was war caused some 30 years after the war than it was a few years after the war. The situation is much more complex. However, I would agree that the major reason for the delay is probably the fact that reasons for the decisions are now being given. The Government is endeavouring to overcome, and I think it is succeeding, this problem by the appointment of additional boards in New South Wales and Victoria. In the other States, boards which formerly operated part time are now working much longer hours. Also some administrative steps have been taken which we hope will speed up the procedures. A firm of management consultants has inquired into the whole system of repatriation boards and tribunals and it has given us a report upon which we are acting. While acknowledging all of these matters, I repeat that it is important for the veterans that they know the reasons for decisions, particularly adverse decisions, and the Government intends to persevere with what we regard as a reform in the repatriation law which was long overdue and which is in the best interests of all those people who are entitled or who believe they are entitled to receive repatriation benefits. </para>

            <para>-I gave <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline> an answer to the latter part of his question the other day to the effect that I did not have any information. I have received a letter from a gentleman in which he states that some money is owed to him by the North Korean Embassy in relation to a deal, and we are looking into that situation. I have had prepared an answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question in relation to the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea, and although it is a little long I think perhaps it should be put on the record. The Australian Embassy at Pyongyang was withdrawn on Saturday, 8 November. I am pleased to report that the members of the Embassy staff are now safely in Peking, having met no hindrance in arranging their departure from Pyongyang. Honourable senators will recall that I informed them last week of the extraordinary circumstances of the withdrawal of the staff of the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea Embassy from Canberra and that the Australian Government had rejected the sweeping, unsupported and untrue allegations which the Embassy had made in a Note circulated after its departure. The difficulties of the delivery of the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Australian Government&#39;s Note, which the DPRK refused to accept, are set out in a Press release from my Department, dated 6 November. At the conclusion of my answer, I will seek leave to have that Press release incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>
          <para>On 6 November, the Australian Charged &#39;Affaires, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Watson, was called to the Foreign Ministry where the Director of Protocol handed over a DPRK Note in insulting terms. I describe it as a Note, though it lacks the customary forms and courtesies of diplomatic correspondence. This Note makes further allegations of an even more irresponsible nature, mainly directed against the Australian Embassy in Pyongyang. I will not dignify these allegations by rebutting each one of them in turn, but will say only that they are so transparently false that they do the Government of the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea no credit and raise serious questions about its willingness or capacity to act in the normally accepted way. This Note was also circulated to all missions in Pyongyang, and it asks other countries to believe that in the space of 7 months a 3-man embassy undertook in a very highly controlled society a pattern of illegal activities which, to use the terminology of the DPRK, &#39;deranged social order&#39;. I again formally reject the charges which have been made against the Australian Government and its representatives. </para>
          <para>The allegations of the DPRK are at variance with what has actually happened in recent months, lt will be recalled that I visited Pyongyang in June and at that time I had 4 hours of official discussions with the DPRK Foreign Minister, Ho Dam. I also had very many unofficial talks with him. The upshot of these discussions was that we agreed that there were differences between our 2 countries on a number of substantive issues, as well as similarities. The DPRK Foreign Minister said that it was natural that there should be &#39;serious differences&#39; between us. These differences focused particularly on the status of the ROK- That is, the Republic of South Korea- as the Government of a state and on its right to membership of international organisations and to an equal place with the DPRK in the working out of any arrangements leading to a reduction of tension in the Korean peninsula and leading towards reunification. </para>
          <para>The position of the Australian Government on this matter is firm. It has been expressed publicly, as in my address at this year&#39;s United Nations General Assembly on 23 September, just as it has been expressed consistently in private conversations not only with the DPRK but also with the friends of the DPRK. It was, for instance, a point made by the Prime Minister in his discussions during his visit to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in January of this year. This has been an approach which the Australian Government has followed consistently since it first established contacts with representatives of the DPRK. In the negotiations leading up to the agreement for the establishment of diplomatic relations, which it will be recalled took place over a period of 6 months during 1974, the Australian Government made it clear that in opening a mission in Pyongyang it did not accept that the opening of a mission required that the Australian Government should change its policies. We specifically indicated that in recognising the DPRK we did not intend to reduce our relations with the ROK. The Government of the DPRK accepted that in 1974. In the event, and for reasons best known to itself, it was unable to accept it in 1 975. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government continues to believe that there must be dialogue with the 2 Koreas and between them. It regrets that the DPRK has made this more difficult by choosing to withdraw its staff from Canberra and by preventing the Australian Government from maintaining its representation in Pyongyang. We will remain ready to talk to the DPRK in other capitals and in international organisations. Relations between our 2 countries have not been severed. It is hardly necessary to say that the actions of the DPRK have not been conducive to the development of the spirit of conciliation or to making progress towards a peaceful and lasting settlement on the Korean peninsula. It is not consistent with the more outgoing foreign policy on which the DPRK seems to have embarked recently that it should be intolerant of differing views or that it should react to them in such an unreasonable and inflammatory way as it has done in its relations with Australia. I ask for leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the Press statement which was released by my Department in respect of this matter. </para>

            <para>- It will be recalled that while there are import restrictions on iron and steel, at present those restrictions are subject to a review by the Industries Assistance Commission. It is expected that the report of the IAC will be received shortly. In view of the delay that will occur before we have advice on what will be done with the IAC report, we have advised importers that licences will be issued for the first 6 months of 1976 at a level not less than 50 per cent of the annual quota which applied to them in 1975. That approval does not seek to anticipate what the IAC may report, but it is the best that we can do to put importers on a firm footing and to allow them to arrange some importations next year. We will make a decision on the IAC report as soon as it is available. </para>

I do not know whether the company&#39;s claim to be the first company to do this is correct, but if it is I think that it calls into serious question the policies which have been followed by other life assurance companies in disqualifying such people from obtaining life assurance. </para>

          <para>As far as the other forms of discrimination are concerned, I think that I have made a number of statements on policies which have been followed by various companies, including the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd, which require that a person should be able to speak and understand English without difficulty before he can obtain a life assurance policy. There have been other discriminatory practices. I think that the answer to the question as to why there may be some elimination of these discriminatory practices is that the private life assurance companies are afraid of the establishment of the Australian Government Insurance Corporation and are afraid of the competition that that would give. This is influencing the private insurance companies to abandon discriminatory policies which otherwise they would still follow. </para>

            <para>- If the alleged operation is called &#39;dirty tricks&#39; I am quite sure that the Government would not have the public servants working for the Opposition. I am not aware of the accusations to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> refers. All I would say is that certainly the Government would be expecting the Public Service to act in its normal way and to discharge its normal duties which I am quite sure the great majority of public servants will continue to do. If I can obtain any further information on the question I shall do so for the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>-The United States Bicentennial Fellowship Scheme is part of a series of activities planned by the Australian Government for 1976 in recognition of the bicentennial year of American independence. The objectives of the Scheme are to allow an exchange of knowledge and to provide an opportunity for cultural and social interchanges between the people of Australia and the people of the United States. Under the Scheme up to 15 Australians will visit the United States and it is proposed that 15 Americans will be invited to Australia next year. The intention is that Australian fellows should not only improve their understanding of America and its culture but should also impart a knowledge of Australia. Similarly, Americans visiting Australia will be expected to bring a willingness to share as well as a desire to learn about our country. The Scheme is non-academic and is open to Australian and American citizens who show potential in their chosen field of endeavour. The awards are tenable for periods of 6 to 10 weeks and benefits include return economy air fares, approved internal travel costs and certain daily allowances. The Scheme has attracted considerable attention already. Since the advertisements were inserted about 3 weeks ago I think there have been about 2500 applicants. But of course, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> would know, the whole Scheme naturally is subject to the passage by the Senate of the Appropriation Bills. </para>

I ask the Minister very simply: Was this information passed to servicemen after discussion with and with the specific approval of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, or is the action in fact contrary to views on the need for continuity of defence which have been expressed already by the Commander-in-Chief to senior members of the Government? </para>

            <para>- I do not know why senators on the other side keep asking questions about the uncertainty of defence pay. The Opposition is creating the situation, not the Government is in the Opposition&#39;s lap. The Opposition can get rid of this uncertainty today if it wants to. In respect of the general position with which we are faced because of the Opposition&#39;s move, all I can say is that certain decisions have been taken with a view to achieving administrative economy and to conserving financial resources. Other measures are under consideration and will be put into effect at the appropriate time. There is no possibility at all that any measure which may be taken will be illegal, as somebody mentioned previously. </para>

            <para>- I have seen the report; I was rather startled. In fact, I read it this morning on an empty stomach and I was surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> should make such an extraordinary claim. I would have been surprised also if the report had appeared in any other newspaper but the <inline font-style="italic">Australian,</inline> in which I read it. Nobody has taken the trouble to check with me or anyone in my Department as to the veracity of these facts, but one of the least engaging characteristics of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> is not checking stories which it receives with those who are supposed to be responsible for administering the matters to which that newspaper refers. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> has said, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> and his colleagues in the Opposition were prepared to stop failing to pass the Appropriation Bills and to give the Government the money to which it is entitled as a government to carry out its business, none of these problems to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> has referred would arise and none of the departments, including the Department of Repatriation and Compensation, would have any problems in paying their accounts. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is no mystery in the fact that a question was raised on one day regarding an account and a cheque was received subsequently. That is more likely to be a coincidence. No doubt the query would have been about an outstanding account. The Department is under no direction from me whatsoever, nor is it pursuing any policy of deliberately withholding the payment of accounts. I categorically deny on my own behalf and on behalf of my Department any such intentions or any such actions. But, I am faced with the position that, some votes under the Supply Acts are subject to greater demands than others. For example- and this is what concerns the specific matter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> referreddivision 527 funds, from which repatriation payments for nursing homes, local medical officers, special medical officers and paramedical services, pharmaceutical services and education allowances are paid, are for all practical purposes already exhausted as a result of the Opposition&#39;s actions. At the end of October, $750,000 was held in this division. Subsequently the Department of the Treasury advanced a further $750,000 out of the Advance to the Treasurer. That amount of $ 1.5m is insufficient in a division which at present is accumulating accounts to the value of $2, 100,000 a week. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline>last week asked specific questions on this matter and I am obtaining the full details from the Department. As I promised then, I hope to inform him on this matter later this week. As to the question of the subsequent receipt of the cheque following the question which was asked in the Senate, I have to point out that the processing of payments is normally spread over several days and no payment has been made as a direct consequence of any question asked of me in the Senate. Subsequent receipt of a payment in the circumstances that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> is reported to have mentioned would be purely coincidental and would not have any relationship to anything that had happened within this chamber. </para>

However, I will refer the specific subject to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly</inline> or perhaps to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden,</inline> whoever is the appropriate Minister, for an answer. </para>

            <para>-The Australian Minerals Council comprises the Australian Minister for Minerals and Energy and also the State Ministers in this field. There have been, I understand, some meetings of the Council in the past but there has not been perhaps the liaison that could have existed. Many of the areas of responsibility, and also the legal rights of the States and the Australian Government are quite clearly defined in some areas and not so clearly defined in others. It is important that there be as much dialogue as possible between the Australian Government and the States so that matters of common interest can be resolved. This does not mean for one moment that the policies of the Australian Government would be in any way abrogated by the attendance of myself at one of those Council meetings. If, in fact, the development of our natural resources can be expedited by a greater degree of consultation with the States, I would think that course ought to be followed. </para>

            <para>- There has already been a great expansion of the east-west trunk system to double the number of telephone circuits on that system. Some $2m worth of equipment was ordered earlier this year to provide a further 600 telephone circuits to raise the capacity to 1 ,800 circuits by 1977. Interstate television programs for the national station at Norseman will be improved by 1976 by the installation of a television program relay bearer between Kalgoorlie and Norseman. A coaxial cable from Ceduna to Cobar will be installed by 1978 to provide a more direct and alternative link to Sydney. The Telecommunications Commission is also planning for the installation of a fourth transcontinental telephony bearer from Norseman to Ceduna by 1979. </para>

            <para>-The first contingent of Australian police to serve with the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus was sent to the island during 1 964. At that time the contingent comprised 40 members, drawn from all Australian police forces. As a consequence of a proposal in 1 974 the contingent was reduced to 35. Following recent population transfers of Turkish Cypriots to the north of the island in accordance with, the agreement concluded between both parties, Greece and Turkey, there is a reduced need for inter communal policing in the Greek Cypriot area. This situation prompted the Secretary-General of the United Nations to propose a reduction in the United Nations peacekeeping force from approximately 3500 to 2900. This meant a reduction of 565 military and 62 police personnel. Under the agreement which was reached on 26 September 1975 the Australian contribution was reduced from 35 to 16 members, lt was agreed that this take effect from the November rotation period. I pay a tribute to the peacekeeping force and to the high standard of the Australian contingent. I think this was shown at the memorial service on 28 October to the late Sergeant Ian Ward who was killed in a land mine explosion on the island in November 1974. </para>

            <para>-Senator Wheeldon has already answered a similar question in respect of repatriation matter. According to the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> this morning, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> allegedly referred to misleading statements, Ministers creating uncertainty about matters, and claims about funds for the Army and the defence services. I have checked with the Department. It is aware, as I am, of only one representation that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> made to me. It was not about funds. It was about the case of a particular serviceman. I responded very quickly by showing the honourable senator the file of the person concerned. No instructions have been given to the Army or to the Department of Defence to cease paying any accounts properly presented for payment. Contractors to the Services have no reason to expect that September accounts will not be paid. What will happen to accounts presented next month is a very different matter. As to creating uncertainty, I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> is the one who is doing that. We all know that it was not long ago that members of the Press were trying to find out from him whether he would vote for Supply. Not long ago he said that he would not stop Supply. Yesterday the television people were at his office to find out what his position is now. It is not the Ministers of the Government who are creating uncertainty. I suggest that it is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> and others. </para>

            <para>- In answering <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> &#39;s question last Thursday I pointed out that there were contradictions between the sworn statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and the answers given on oath by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> when he appeared before the Senate. I was very impressed with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> and I think that all honourable senators believed, with a degree of confidence, that he was speaking the truth. That has perhaps created the suspicion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> has been more truthful than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> Subsequent to that there have been some apparent contradictions in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> &#39;s statement.

That statement completely contradicted the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.

As the honourable senator said, some Ministers did have sufficient confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> to ask him to find out what he could do about raising funds. We have now reached the position where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> is the idol of the Opposition, which is using him in an endeavour to justify its unconstitutional attitude in relation to the rejection of Supply. For that reason, members of the Opposition have some desire to uphold him as a paragon of virtue when, in view of the facts, he is not. I would say to the Opposition that to justify its stand it has to get a better idol than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline></para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Social Security: Does he recall giving the Senate payout figures on behalf of Medibank for the months of July and August? Does he recall that on page 9 10 of the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he stated that for July 160 000 claims costing somewhat less than $ 13.5m were paid and that in August 3 million claims at a cost of somewhat less than $30m were paid? I ask the Minister: Does he check the veracity of the statements that he makes in the Senate? If so, can he indicate why the average cost of the claims paid by Medibank in July were approximately $84 but only $10 in August? </para>

            <para>I have been asked several questions over a period of some weeks by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> and I am now in a position to inform the Senate concerning the future status of students from South Vietnam and Cambodia, some of whom have expressed concern that the Government may require them to return to their home countries against their will. Any such concern is without foundation. The Government has no such intention. However, it is expected that many of the students from Vietnam and Cambodia who are currently completing their courses will wish to return home. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government has now decided that Government sponsored students from South Vietnam and Cambodia may apply for resident status in Australia if they so desire. This applies whether they have completed their studies, have terminated their studies before completion or still have a further period of study ahead of them to complete their courses. Since 1973 private students from these two countries have been eligible under the normal policy to seek resident status upon the successful completion of their study courses. The Government&#39;s decision will now enable those private students who are still studying or who have abandoned their studies to apply for resident status if they do not wish to return home. </para>
          <para>Some private and Government sponsored students may be in receipt of special financial assistance from the Australian Government to enable them to continue their studies. The acquisition of resident status could influence their continued eligibility to receive that assistance. We will ensure that private and Government sponsored students in this situation who apply for resident status will be fully informed so that they can determine whether they would prefer the question of resident status to be held over until they have completed their studies. There would, of course, be no problems about extension of their temporary stay for this purpose. </para>
          <para>This decision recognises the situation of Vietnamese and Cambodian students and does not, by implication, confer on students from other countries the same privileges. Concern has also been expressed by some students from Laos whose courses of study have finished or are about to finish that the Government may require them to return to their home country. Any Laotian student who has completed his studies and applies to remain permanently will have his application considered sympathetically on its merits against the normal criteria for such cases. </para>

            <para>- During question time last Thursday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> raised a matter with me regarding the practice of circulating answers to questions on notice and I undertook to obtain whatever information I could for him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> made the point that answers to questions sometimes appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> before honourable senators have had a chance to ask the question of the Minister orally in the chamber. Senators will recall that the Senate considered proposals for new Standing Orders on 19 and 20 August 1975, and finally agreed to give a trial period to a proposed new standing order No. 103, with a modification. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Standing Orders Committee originally proposed that a new standing order No. 103 in the following terms should be adopted: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The reply to a Question on Notice shall be given by delivering the same to the  Clerk.  A copy thereof shall be supplied to the <inline font-weight="bold">Senator who</inline> has asked the Question, and such Question and reply shall be printed in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Senate, however, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, added the following words: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Provided that any <inline font-weight="bold">Senator who,</inline> pursuant to this Standing Order, has received a copy of a reply may, by leave, ask the Question and have the reply read in the Senate. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Senate agreed that the proposed standing order, with the amendment, should be adopted as a Sessional Order for a period of 3 months, so that its workability could be tested. The Sessional Order is due to be reviewed by the Senate on the first sitting day after 20 November. </para>
          <para>One of the reasons for the adoption of the proposal was to enable any answers to questions on notice received to be included in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> if received before the time for finalising the Notice Paper and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The procedure eliminated the need for a list to be circulated in the chamber prior to the sitting of the Senate, and eliminated the need for an early cut-off time for the acceptance of replies. The practice has been that where answers are received too late in the day for the question to be asked orally, but are included in Hansard, honourable senators may still ask the question on the following sitting day and it will again appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>
          <para>It would seem that the answers to questions to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> referred arrived very late in the day, far too late for them to be asked at the end of question time, but early enough to be included in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> It may be that there are some problems with the system on trial at the moment, in which case I suggest that honourable senators raise the matter when the Senate reviews the procedure on the first sitting day after 20 November. </para>

            <para>-by leave-The first notice of motion relates to certain provisions in the Postal Services Regulations and the Postal By-laws. There are 2 separate questions involved. The first is the power of officers of the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Postal Commission to open and dispose of mail. The regulations provide that mail may be opened where it may contain matter in contravention of any law, or subject to customs duty, or which has been posted overseas on behalf of persons in Australia in order to gain the advantage of lower overseas postage rates. There is also a regulation allowing the opening of mail posted at concessional rates, but this power is so expressed as to leave some doubt as to its extent. The regulations and by-laws also provide for the disposal of mail which contains such matter. </para>
          <para>The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances regarded these provisions as unduly infringing the rights and liberties of citizens. The Committee considers that the right to privacy of mail is an important right of the citizen, and ought to be abridged only pursuant to law, and with proper safeguards against misuse of the powers conferred by law. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bishop)</inline> has agreed to have the regulations amended so that mail may be opened only where there is a reasonable suspicion that it contravenes the law, or is subject to customs duty, or is posted abroad to take advantage of lower rates overseas. The regulation allowing the opening of concessional rate mail will be amended so as to make it clear that such mail may be opened only where it is a condition of its transmission that it be open for inspection. Mail which is alleged to contravene the law will not be disposed of except pursuant to a court order to that effect. There is already in the Customs Act a right of appeal where articles are alleged to be subject to customs duty. The regulations will be amended so that mail may not be disposed of if it is subject to legal proceedings. The by-laws will be amended so that there will be a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal where it is alleged that mail has been posted abroad to take advantage of lower rates overseas. Where mail has been opened and delivered, the recipient will be notified not only of the fact that his mail has been opened, but also of the reason for it being opened. The Committee regards these proposed amendments of the regulations and by-laws as providing proper limits to the power to open and dispose of mail, and proper safeguards of the rights of the citizen. The second question, arising in relation to certain postal by-laws, was the payment of compensation for registered or certified mail which is lost or damaged. The by-laws gave the Postal Commission the final say as to any compensation to be paid. The Committee has been assured that an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be provided in relation to this matter. On behalf of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee I would like to thank the Postmaster-General who, once again, has shown a ready appreciation of the matters raised by the Committee, and a willingness to assist the Committee to achieve it objectives. </para>
          <para>The second notice of motion relates to 2 provisions in the Australian Capital Territory Liquor Ordinance. The first provision appeared to allow the Liquor Licensing Board to cancel a liquor licence without first holding a hearing. The Committee considered that, notwithstanding the provision of a right of appeal to a court where a licence is cancelled, a licensee ought to have a right to be heard before his licence is cancelled. The Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> has agreed to amend the Ordinance to this effect. The other provision appeared to be unclear in its effect, but it has been explained to the satisfaction of the Committee. In view of the action taken by the responsible Ministers, I withdraw Business of the Senate, notices of motion Nos 1 and 2, standing in my name. I wish to assure the Senate that in spite of the difficulties of recent weeks, the Committee has continued its work of scrutinising delegated legislation to safeguard the rights and liberties of Australian citizens. I would like to thank my colleagues on the Committee for their assistance in this work, and also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack,</inline> who took some interest in the matter of the Postal Services Regulations. </para>

            <para>- By leave- I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> and the members of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances for the interest they took in these regulations and for the manner in which they have sought and obtained significant amendments to them. I believe that the privacy of every citizen is of fundamental importance in the community. As these regulations under the Postal Services Regulations definitely infringe in the many ways which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> has detailed, it was certainly an important matter for the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee to take into consideration and to seek to amend. I am also very pleased to note that the Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop,</inline> accepted the suggestions that were made by the Committee and has undertaken to have these regulations redrafted in the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> has indicated. I hope the new regulations will meet the various points which have been made. Naturally, we will all be looking to them with great interest when they come to light. Of course, if they are not satisfactory the powers of the Senate still remain to ensure that they are amended in a suitable manner. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I refer briefly to the magnitude of this issue by directing attention to answers to questions on notice. I placed the questions on the notice paper some little time ago and I received the answers the other day. I asked the Postmaster-General how many postal articles had been opened since 1 July 1975. The answer was 1 540 045 letters. That is a million and a half letters which have been opened in the period of 4 months since 1 July. Although the vast majority of these are letters through the Dead Letter Office, nevertheless 723 articles which were suspected of being posted in contravention of the regulations were opened. The mere fact that letters have to be opened for good reason, particularly through the Dead Letter Office, does not detract from the seriousness of this threat to privacy. It may well be that this happens because of mere need but the fact that letters to the tune of 1 .5 million have been opened over a period of 4 months shows that this is a serious problem. I am very pleased that the regulations will be amended to take some account of these basic principles. I congratulate all those who have taken part in this matter. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to set up, in place of the Universities Commission and the Commission on Advanced Education, a Tertiary Education Commission assisted by 2 Councils which are to advise the Government on the development and support of higher education in Australia. The establishment of a Tertiary Education Commission has been a possibility for a number of years, but the importance of greater co-ordination has recently become more apparent. Since 1965, when the advisory body on advanced education was set up in parallel to the Universities Commission, a number of significant changes have taken place. The Panel, whose recommendations the Government has accepted in deciding to establish the Tertiary Commission, has pointed out these factors: there has been very considerable growth in tertiary education, particularly in the advanced education sector, which has matured and is now comparable with the universities sector in terms of the resources committed to it; teacher education has been accepted within the advanced education program; tuition fees have been abolished; and the Australian Government has taken on full financial responsibility for tertiary education. </para>
          <para>A great deal of consultation takes place between the two existing Commissions, but their formal responsibilities remain separate, and no amount of consultation can guarantee the degree of overall co-ordination and rationalisation in tertiary education programs which is now clearly desirable. The Panel in its report has made a valuable attempt to delineate the main distinctions between universities and colleges. These include different patterns of legal basis, relation to Government, vocational or academic emphasis, degree of research commitment, and the nature of courses provided. Even so, these distinctions are clearly very difficult to define with precision. Many characteristics are shared across the two groups of institutions, just as there is considerable variation within each group in the size and activities of particular institutions, and demarcation is sometimes blurred. </para>
          <para>A number of different views were put to the Panel about the nature of the advisory arrangements which should be established. The main alternatives are set out in the Panel &#39;s report. In general, the proponents of the various possible systems were agreed on the importance of giving due recognition to the characteristics of existing institutions and maintaining appropriate distinctions in any process of rationalisation. The Government recognises the importance of maintaining the two existing systems, and this is reflected in the present Bill, which defines universities and colleges separately, and provides for the Commission to have the assistance of two Councils- a Universities Council and an Advanced Education Council- each with a special concern for its own area. The Bill ensures that membership of these two Councils must be sufficiently different at all times to maintain fully their separate identity. The Councils will respectively represent the Commission in dealing with individual universities and colleges, which will thus find that they have much the same channels of communication as they do with the existing Commission. </para>
          <para>The measures I have just outlined will ensure the continuation, under the new Commission, of the valuable distinction between the two sets of institutions. As this distinction is essential to efficiency, the separate Councils are established. As the claims of universities and advanced education on resources have become enormous, the co-ordination of these claims- especially capital claims- through a Tertiary Education Commission has become essential. At the same time, the Government recognises that its machinery in this area should not be static or inflexible. Whilst the Bill reflects present policies and practices to the extent I have outlined, it is sufficiently adaptable in its approach to cater for future changes in policy and circumstances. For example, whilst the schedules to the present Bill have been drawn up on the basis of the existing situation, the new Commission will be expected to give careful consideration to the lists in the schedules, and the position of some institutions may need to be reappraised, now that there is a Technical and Further Education Commission operating. </para>
          <para>The Government will look to the Commission and its Councils to take steps to increase the chances for higher education throughout the nation in diverse ways, including through what has become known as Open Tertiary Education. The Bill enables the Minister for Education to appoint committees to assist the Commission in relation to specific matters. Open Tertiary Education is clearly a matter worthy of such special attention. I would like to make special mention of the extent to which the Commission will be expected to consult with all those bodies which have a concern with tertiary education and its interface with other areas. Section 7 (2) of the Bill provides that the Commission shall consult, as appropriate, with the Technical and Further Education Commission, with universities and colleges of advanced education and with the States, as well as with other appropriate persons and organisations. </para>
          <para>When the new Commission comes into operation, we can expect increased effectiveness and savings in administration. The two secretariats will merge, and their staff numbers and costs are likely to be reduced. Tertiary education capital planning calls for skilled building labour, a great flow of building material, and the prevention of wasteful competition between programs. It also  calls for the greatest availability of courses without wasteful duplication of rarer but essential courses of study and training. Thought needs to be given, where possible, to shared facilities. The Commission will, in these respects, achieve what is needed. The Bill should receive the speedy assent of Parliament. </para>

            <para>Supply Bills (Nos 1 and 2) 1975-76 each included an amount of $120m for the respective Advance to the Treasurer appropriations. </para>
            <para>A statement made in the Senate (Hansard 20 May, pages 1564 to 1568) pointed out that the Advance to the Treasurer appropriations are designed not only to meet cost increases but also to meet a very broad range of unpredictable, unexpected and unavoidable contingencies arising from many sources- including changes in expenditure patterns, timing of deliveries of supplies and work completion under contracts, the introduction of new programs and/or authorities for which Parliament approval could not first be obtained, as well as emergency needs. </para>
            <para>That statement also emphasised that the Supply Bills are by nature a temporary funding provision and that estimates contained in them are not made in the same detail as for annual Appropriation Bills. Broadly, Supply Bills (Nos1 and 2) 1975-76 aimed to provide for services, at the levels authorised by the 1974-75 Budget, until end November 1975. </para>
            <para>The Prime Minister stated on 24 October 1975, with reference to the situation if the Opposition in the Senate continues to deny passage of the Appropriation Bills, that steps have been taken to ensure that wage and salary payments will be maintained through the Supply period, that is until the end of November, and that it is likely that in addition to wages and salaries most other essential payments can also be wholly maintained until the end of November. </para>
