          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator TOWNLEY</inline>(Tasmania)-Mr  President,  several months ago I said publicly that I had resumed my financial membership of the Tasmanian Liberal Party in a private capacity and that I would continue in this place for as long as possible as an independent senator, keeping in mind the good of Tasmania and the nation. Over the brief space of a couple of months we have witnessed the Australian economy pass into an acute recession. The direct actions of our present Government have had a disastrous effect upon the ability of hundreds of thousands of Australians to earn their livelihood, and amongst them are a great number of Tasmanians. Unfortunately, as this parliamentary year begins there is no sign of recovery and it is my contention that there will be no restoration of confidence until we see a change of government. </para>

However, the Leader of the Opposition and I had discussions this morning and again after lunch about arrangements for today. I had the distinct impression that the statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> was to make was to be brief and to the point. However, probably because of lack of time, I was not able to tell my colleagues at the time that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> would seek to make a statement of the type I was under the impression that it would be and therefore <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> I understand, refused leave. It was at my request and at the request of the Leader of the Government in the Senate that our attitude on that aspect was reviewed. Leave was then granted in the conscientious belief that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> 's statement was to be brief and to the point. I say quite frankly that had I known the statement was to be of the type that it is the Government would not have acceded to the statement being made. </para>

            <para>- For the reasons I have given I have taken the formal step of joining the Parliamentary Liberal Party from this time. Two other factors have been important in the formation of this decision. Firstly, I consider it most undemocratic for one person to hold the very considerable power I held as the independent in the balance of power. Secondly, I feel that Tasmania will be better served by a combination of Tasmanian anti-socialist groups with a united purpose against Labor. This is the time for a concerted effort by all those Tasmanians interested in a change of government, not a time for fragmentation. My anti-Labor feelings are well known, as is the fact that I have been a member of the Liberal Party since the early 1950s. My desire to help Tasmania is also well known, and I feel confident that now I will be able to help even more as a member of the Liberal team. </para>

              <para>-On behalf of the Opposition, I advise the Senate that a pair will be granted for the vacancy presently existing in the State of New South Wales. The pair is granted on the basis of and in accordance with the long standing tradition in the Senate that all States should be equally represented and that no political group should take advantage of an unusual situation brought about by either death or resignation. Honourable senators will recall that in the past when deaths have occurred on either side of the chamber the deceased senator has been paired until his replacement has been appointed or elected. Honourable senators will also know that it is our view, and we know it to be the view of the Government, that divisions should not be lost or won by misadventure. We all know that the rule in the Senate has been and is that sickness, family bereavement or suchlike means that pairs must be and always are granted. Likewise, we believe that death or resignation should always warrant a pair. I am sure that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate agrees with the proposition I have put down, and I invite him to acknowledge it. </para>

            <para>- by leave- On behalf of the Government, I express pleasure that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> has made the announcement that he has just made. The Government notes in particular that the pair is granted on the basis of and in accordance with the long standing tradition in the Senate that all States should be equally represented and that no political group should take advantage of any unusual situation brought about by either death or resignation. I discussed this matter briefly this morning with the Leader of the Opposition, and he told me then that he would consider the matter and advise me of the outcome after, I take it, discussion with his colleagues. Doubtless he has now had those discussions, and he has made a statement on behalf of the Opposition. I think it fair to say that since I have been in the position of Manager of Government Business in the Senate we have been able to sort out the pairs situation. Now, having been invited to acknowledge the situation publicly, I concur in the proposition put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> and I agree in principle with his general statement. </para>

I should have done this immediately ministerial arrangements were announced. Firstly, the Liberal Party offers its congratulations to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt.</inline> I understand he is the first Tasmanian from the Australian Labor Party to occupy the position of Leader of the Government in the Senate. As we of the Opposition are aware, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> is a hard working Minister. He has always been courteous, he is a vigorous debater, and I think that generally around the chamber he has a large number of friends. We wish him well in his short stay on that side of the table. We hope he does not find his task too arduous. </para>

I wish him well in his office. I am quite sure that he will find it interesting and I think, to a degree, rewarding. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> will have some problems and might say to himself: 'Why did I ever offer myself for the position?'. It has always been my belief that leaders of the Government in the Senate have to be able to communicate. From my experience with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> 1 believe he will be able to communicate. I know from a statement I saw yesterday that this is the objective of the new leader. I say to him on behalf of the Country Party and on my own behalf that I am sure we will co-operate with him at all times. I wish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> well, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has said, in his short stay in office. </para>

I realise, as I am sure my colleague the Minister for Manufacturing Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> realises, the great responsibility that falls on the shoulders not only of those in the Ministry but also on the leaders of either House of the Parliament. It is my desire that the Senate should work as effectively as possible. I must say in return- it is not soft soap- that while I have been in the Ministry I have found both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> easy people to work with. I am sure that that situation will continue. </para>

        <para>Obviously we will have some rough times during this sessional period. I am quite sure that no holds will be barred when it comes to debate on matters of policy. There are many areas in the Senate where we can, by co-operation, facilitate the passage of legislation. It is necessary not only for us as a Government on this side of the chamber to do that but for the whole of the Senate to do so as one of the Houses of the Parliament. I assure the Senate that I will do all that I  can to ensure that we make the passage of legislation as smooth as possible even though at times it will be awfully rough. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Is it a fact, as widely reported in the Australian Press by journalists who accompanied the Prime Minister, that microphones were found in the air conditioning and that there were 2-way mirrors and secret doors in the hotel rooms allocated to members of the Prime Minister's party visiting Russia? Did uninvited Russians enter the room of one Australian group and on detection flee through a concealed door, described by the journalists as a swinging door panel set in the main door? Was baggage of members of the party searched in their rooms? If these statements are incorrect, has the Minister for Foreign Affairs apologised to the Russian Government for the statements made by Australian journalists? If these statements are correct, is this the proper and correct treatment to be accorded to the Australian Head of Government and his staff when visiting Russia? Did the Prime Minister object to or accept this treatment? If the conduct occurred, is this the price of a visit by the Prime Minister of this country to Russia? </para>

            <para>-I have not had time to study in detail the document referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> but I have been able to look at extracts from it and it is clear that there is a contradiction, as was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> in his question. It is clear also that the Opposition would be no more able to exercise effective controls over wages and salaries than is the Government at the present time because of the lack of constitutional power, but at least this Government has taken the initiative to support the proposal for the indexation of wages now before the Arbitration Commission. It would seem to me, especially from statements made by, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser, that any means used by the Opposition as a government would be repressive means. This is not the solution to the wage explosion problem. </para>

              <para>-I think the point should be made that at the present time the Prices Justification Tribunal is the only machinery available to the Australian Government to try to put a brake on prices. Until such time as wider constitutional powers are available to the Australian Government this machinery must remain in existence. I am sure that it is a matter of concern to all Australians that the suggestion should be made that this Tribunal should be abolished. </para>

            <para>- During the course of last year the Prime Minister on many occasions stated, and stated correctly, that the Government had been elected for a 3-year term to implement the policy which it had put before the Australian people. Certainly, any government, if it finds the necessity to do so, must alter the rate at which it attempts to do certain things. We made it quite clear that we intended to expand Government spending in certain areas of the economy. We have done that. I do not believe that there is any Australian who would say that we should have spent less money on education, pensions, health services or a whole range of other matters. I do not think that the farmers, who I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> hopes will vote for him, would think that there should have been any less spent on the wool support scheme, for example. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is not a matter of retraction or going back on the principles which this Government has set out in various statements. If it is necessary for a government to alter the rate of change, then a government is at liberty to do so. Certain Government measures were referred to by the honourable senator. In particular, he referred to the superphosphate bounty with which I am perhaps more familiar. The recent decision represents a recognition by the Government of the changed circumstances in the rural sector. At the time the original decision was taken it was accepted that there was a degree of buoyancy in the rural sector which it must be conceded does not obtain at the present time. The Government recognises that and for that reason it has decided to refer the whole question of phosphate to the Industries Assistance Commission. </para>

            <para>- I have made investigations into this matter as a result of representations from the Western Australian Aboriginal Legal Service, representatives of which were at Laverton on the occasion in respect of which there were allegations of police bashings. As a result of those representations and a delegation from the Legal Service I wrote to the Acting Premier of Western Australia- I believe it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McPharlin-</inline> asking him to support the request of the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service for a royal commission. I suggested that if the reason that Western Australia did not appoint a royal commission was the cost involved, as had been stated in the Press, I was prepared to approach the Australian Special Minister of State and to ask him to finance a joint royal commission on behalf of both the Australian Government and the Western Australian Government. I have had no reply to that correspondence, but since writing it I have heard other allegations that would dwarf into insignificance the reported allegations of the police bashing at Laverton. This shows that there is some need for an inquiry into the relationship between Aborigines and police in Western Australia. </para>

I think the allegations concerning events at Laverton and the other allegations which I have conveyed by correspondence to the Acting Premier justify a public royal commission into the relationship between police and Aborigines in Western Australia.

          <para>I believe a magistrate has been appointed to make inquiries into what happened at Laverton. He will report upon what is told to him by witnesses but his investigations will not involve any right of public examination as to the accuracy of the statements made to him. The sergeant at Kalgoorlie has admitted that the police over-reacted and that some brutality occurred there that should not have occurred. These are things that should be open to inquiry. I refer to them only as allegations. They should be subject to a full and open inquiry. I have made every attempt with the Western Australian Minister to get a joint inquiry. If he eventually refuses I will have to approach the Australian Cabinet to see whether we can do anything on an Australian basis. </para>

Without doubt he is capable of bringing a constructive mind to finding solutions to the problems of the industry which he will find in considerable confusion and disarray when he begins to examine it. I am sure he is aware of the Jackson committee of inquiry into manufacturing industry which has been taking evidence from sections of the industry for quite a long time. I ask him whether he could indicate now or later when the Committee 's report may be finalised and be available for scrutiny by us all? </para>

As a result I was able to assess at first hand the information needs of the people of Darwin, so many of whom were tragically being evacuated because of the circumstances. Since the visit at that time by myself and a number of my ministerial colleagues, the Minister for Social Security has been to Darwin and has personally investigated the social needs of the people of Darwin and of the evacuees from Darwin. Of course our colleague the Minister for the Northern Territory keeps us continually informed of developments. </para>

            <para>- Has the Leader of the Government in the Senate any knowledge of a statement by the Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania, as reported in the Tasmanian Press last Saturday and yesterday, in which he condemned the intrusion of the Country Party into Tasmania, criticised the move as an image building expedition by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> and requested the Country Party to clear out, as he put it? How does this public repudiation of the Country Party or National Party by the Liberal Party in Tasmania square with the much vaunted close cooperation and rapport between this so-called coalition which purports to be the alternative government of this country? </para>

            <para>-I think that probably every Tasmanian read the statement of the Leader of the Liberal Party in that State following the visit to Tasmania by leading personalities of the Country Party including, I understand, the Premier of Queensland. There have been many occasions on which the Country Party has endeavoured to establish itself as a viable political force in Tasmania but it always has suffered the same fate. I suggest that this effort will suffer a similar fate in the few months ahead. The Tasmanian people are wise enough to know that they have had many years of good rule under the Labor Party and the leadership of men like Eric Reece, and if they wish to have an alternative they will turn to the Liberal Party. I think that would be the proper course for them to follow although I am sure they will not do so. Nevertheless I suggest that the Country Party's chances of being established in Tasmania are exactly the same as they have always been, and that is nil. </para>

            <para>- My question, addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, follows the comments he made in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> earlier today in regard to the Prices Justification Tribunal. I refer to the statement of the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Moore, that decisions by the Prices Justification Tribunal had delayed the movement towards conciliation between unions and employers. In view of the Government's belated recognition that unemployment in excess of 3 1 1 000 will not be materially reduced until confidence and co-operative industrial relations have been restored in the private sector of the Australian economy, I ask: What is the Government's present position with regard to the future operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal? </para>

            <para>- I have not seen the statement referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> and therefore it is difficult for me to comment. I would assume on the basis of what she said in her question that her reference to the Prices Justification Tribunal concerns the fact that the Government issued a direction recently to the Tribunal that it take into account the effect of investment in the private sector and the need for private companies to maintain a reasonable level of investment. I think that was a sensible decision and I am sure it would be applauded by the private sector. I do not know in what way prior to that the Tribunal may have exacerbated relations between employers and employees, but if that is the case then the recent instruction to the Tribunal has been a step in the right direction. It is the Government's policy to continue the operations of the Tribunal. I am sure that this will be a stabilising factor for Australia in the months ahead. </para>

Cairns, and on a visit to Darwin we announced a number of important concessions. Telegram, telephone and telex charges were reduced by about one-third and there was an arrangement, which I think is now well known, for free postage out of Darwin for standard letters. For the other related mail services there were cuts of from 25 per cent to 50 per cent. In addition, very special arrangements, which still continue, were made for charitable organisations such as the Red Cross and the Salvation Army to have free services not only in the capital cities but also in their agencies in Darwin. Very extensive deductions were made. The Government plans to meet the cost of those deductions by special appropriations. Of course, they were justified in the circumstances. </para>

          <para>One or two questions have been asked about Darwin. Without reflecting or commenting upon the employees in the other departments, I wish to say specially that the Government and I appreciate the efforts which were made by members of the Australian Post Office staff who, as from after the calm before the cyclone, worked for many hours giving a voluntary service in damp and bad conditions. Also, they lived in very difficult circumstances. By a great co-operative effort they were able to feed, look after and accommodate in special emergency arrangements other Post Office staff. That service ought to be recognised by me. I am doing that suitably through the Department. 1 thought that I should mention it at this stage. </para>

That policy was followed by our predecessors and it has been continued by this Government. Each State is expected to bear a minimum amount of the cost of such fires before the Australian Government will assist. I am not aware of any request having come from the South Australian Premier to the Prime Minister, but I am sure that if such a request were received it would receive sympathetic consideration because the magnitude of the damage caused by the fire in the area referred to by the honourable senator was very great. I shall inquire of the Prime Minister and let the honourable senator know whether such a request has been forthcoming. </para>

The amount provided by the Commonwealth Government for South Australia is nearly $5m.

            <para>-For 25 years the previous Government did nothing to develop frequency modulation broadcasting in Australia. Within 2 years of the Australian Labor Party's coming into office we had a frequency modulation station on the air. It is a community broadcasting station owned by the Music Broadcasting Society of New South Wales. I think that shows the difference in pace between the style of government that now exists and the style of government that existed under the Liberal and Country parties. Additionally, hopefully this month, depending on the approval of local government organisations in Melbourne for the erection of a mast, a frequency modulation radio station will come into existence in Melbourne. Let me deal with the other aspects of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson's</inline> question. It is true that the Australian Labor Party at its conference in Terrigal last week determined that there shall be no development of commercial frequency modulation stations in Australia for the time being, but of course that decision does not stop the development of frequency modulation community broadcasting stations somewhat of the type to which I have already referred. It certainly does not stop the development of frequency modulation broadcasting by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable senator will know that in past years under the previous Government a policy was adopted to protect the airwaves of this country by locking up and restricting the development of frequencies in the amplitude modulation frequency band. That restriction has been undone by this Government, and considerable development is now going on in the AM frequency band; so much so that applications for commercial licences were recently called for in Wollongong, Adelaide and the north-western suburbs of Sydney. A community broadcasting service in the AM band is being opened in Campbelltown in New South Wales and another will be opened in Melbourne in the near future. 1 can assure the honourable senator that one cannot look at frequency modulation in isolation from amplitude modulation. The two have to be looked at conjointly, one with the other. The Government in developing the airwaves of this country will take those factors into account. </para>

            <para>-As soon as the Government became aware of the disaster that had occurred in Darwin as a result of the cyclone we considered what steps should be taken to provide compensation for people who had lost property and also the people who had suffered personal injury or who required compensation as a result of the death of persons on whom they were dependent. There is no clearly established precedent for matters such as this because various different steps have been taken by different governments at different times and in different circumstances. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My Department did advertise widely throughout Australia that there were available to people who had been living in Darwin at the time and had suffered some damage, forms which they should complete and return to officers of the Department of Repatriation and Compensation. A large number of forms have been returned- I think the number is considerably more than 10 000- from people, most of whom claimed for property damage. Fortunately, as all honourable senators are aware, the death toll and the number of personal injuries, although tragic, were perhaps rather surprisingly low in view of the almost total devastation of the city of Darwin. </para>
          <para>As far as personal injury is concerned, very few of the people who were injured or who were bereaved and lost people on whom they were dependent were covered by any form of insurance. Naturally very few of them would be able to obtain workers' compensation payments- if indeed any of them would be able to obtain such payments- because most, if not all, of those people who were injured or killed were not working at the time of the cyclone. With regard to property damage, one of the matters which have been revealed as a result of the survey undertaken by my Department has been, as probably one would expect, that most people were under-insured. Some were not insured at all. </para>
          <para>A matter of this kind does raise a great many problems- I suppose one could correctly describe them as philosophical problems- as to what attitude one should adopt in such a circumstance. If a single house is burnt down by a small bushfire the person who has lost his house is obviously no worse off than somebody who is one of 10 000 people who have had their houses burned down. I suppose one could ask why one should differentiate because a lot of houses have been burnt down rather than one or two. It has been the attitude of this Government and I think of other governments that the very special circumstances of a national disaster such as that which occurred in Darwin require special treatment. Accordingly, the Government will extend such treatment. </para>
          <para>What we are at present doing is assessing the total amount of property loss, the total amount of personal injury, and the extent to which the property damage and personal injury are covered by insurance. It is not my own view that people who were insured should not be entitled to any benefit at all, provided of course that they were not fully insured and as with people who were would receive more than 100 per cent compensation if they were to be paid something. The Government is looking at a proper formula whereby we can apply whatever moneys are made available by the Government to restore the damage that has been done in Darwin and also to assess the amount of money which we will make available. It still is not completely clear precisely what is the total amount of damage suffered in Darwin. </para>
          <para>If I may say so in conclusion, what has occurred in Darwin is I think an illustration of the necessity for some form of national insurance or national compensation scheme, without canvassing the one which is embodied in the Bill which is presently before the Senate. Situations such as this occur all the time either in isolated instances or in the case of disasters such as that which occurred in Darwin. Clearly people are not normally adequately covered by their own private insurance. There has to be some comprehensive approach by the Government to the total question of compensation in matters of this kind. In fact the Government is undertaking such an approach at the present time. </para>

            <para>- I think it is unfortunate for the honourable senator that his friends at Leonora are now making public an accusation made against them which was kept secret. It was alleged by the Aboriginal community when I was at Leonora that Aborigines employed on special works projects were engaged in building a shed on the property of one of the councillors and in plucking Christmas ducks for another councillor. Another misuse of the labour force was cleaning the car of someone on the council. I brought up this matter at a private meeting of the council. While it was admitted that such personnel were employed on such work it was claimed that payment had been made to the council for the time these people spent on such jobs. The accusation was made. I then referred the answer back to those who had informed me. I took the matter no further. If the council wants to be proud of its use of labour in this respect, which it admitted, then it has used the honourable senator as the vehicle to make the matter public. </para>

            <para>- Towards the end of last year, when it became evident that the world beef market was in a very deplorable state, the Australian Government decided to send a mission to Eastern Europe to see what the prospects of selling beef were in that part of the world. As a result of that mission and of the inclusion on it of representatives of the Australian Meat Board a contract for 40 000 tonnes of beef has been negotiated with the Soviet authorities. This suggests that, in the present position of the world beef market, the Soviet importing authorities see the need to establish assured sources of supply for beef in the years ahead. There is no doubt that beef will come back strongly in world markets and that there will be a position similar to that which existed several years ago when, being a seller's market, it was difficult for importing countries to be assured of their source of supply. I feel that as a result of the negotiations which have taken place in Moscow we can look forward to a reasonably stable market in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the years ahead. I am quite sure that every effort will be made by both the Australian Meat Board and the Department of Overseas Trade to consolidate the market that has been established. </para>

I drew his attention to the plight of private road hauliers in South Australia who are suffering grave economic hardship as a result of this Government intrusion. As I have received no reply from the former Minister to my urgent request for his comment, will the present Minister take speedy action to ensure that future movement of freight to Darwin is contracted to the private operators who have rendered such good service to the people of the Northern Territory in the past, in order to alleviate their present serious economic position? </para>

            <para>- I was not aware that a telegram had been sent to my predecessor in this office and I will look into that aspect of the question immediately. However, I understand that the Department of Manufacturing Industry did transport considerable quantities of urgently needed Government materials to Darwin in the immediate wake of the cyclone disaster. Most of the vehicles used for this task now have been withdrawn and supplies for the Darwin population will continue to be transported by established hauliers. It is expected that in the immediate future, because of the fact that the township is now in the process of being rebuilt, there obviously will not be as much work for established hauliers as there normally would be. But I can assure the honourable senator that there is no intention on the part of the Government or any of its departments to supplant orin any way affect the prosperity of established hauliers. </para>

            <para>-For some time my Department has been negotiating with the Muzak organisation to have Australian musicians perform Australian musical productions that can be used in the music process. To date I think it is fair to say that if not all, then nearly all music used in the system operated by the Muzak people is of overseas origin. As a result of discussions that officers of my Department have had with the Muzak organisation, I understand that the organisation now proposes to record these tracks using local musicians for use in the systems now operating in Australia and also that these tracks will be for sale to local radio stations. </para>

          <para>The Australasian Performing Right Association has sent a list of the 30 top songs of 1974 to the Muzak organisation and I understand that Muzak intends recording these almost immediately. The Australasian Performing Right Association has advised me that it is so enthusiastic about the project that it has offered to pay the cost of additional musicians for all sessions, thereby increasing the number of players to be used in this performance from five to twelve in all. It is a considerable breakthrough in the development of opportunities for Australian performing artists, particularly those who are members of the Professional Musicians Association. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and relates also to the Darwin cyclone. By way of preface, I point out that nothing I say reflects on the Postmaster-General 's Department or its employees. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that twice in Australia's history all communications, defence and civil, have been destroyed in Darwin, the first occasion being on 1 9 February 1942 and the second on Christmas Day last year. In view of the serious weakness that this exposes in the communications system and in Australian security, is the Government making any investigation- I ask this in no partisan fashion for it reflects apparently on past governments as well- to determine why defence and civil communications have not been weather proofed and bomb proofed so that neither cyclones nor enemy action can destroy them? I ask this with this question also in mind: Is the Minister aware of the enormous heartbreak and hardships that were caused despite the great actions of Post Office and other employees in the week or more after the cyclone when it was not possible for people to find out whether their relatives or friends had survived or what was the nature of injuries and accidents? Is he aware of the enormous difficulties encountered in dealing with the evacuees sympathetically and effectively at airports because of the sheer absence of any communications, even days after the cyclone? Finally, would not the mobile facilities existing in the defence forces have enabled a more ready opening of communications? I ask this in an entirely non-partisan way and because I believe it to be of major importance for the future. </para>

            <para>-Senator Carrick has raised a matter which has concerned the Government ever since the cyclone hit Darwin. My understanding is that there was microwave communication with the southern States. I am not even sure what that means, to be quite frank; but it means some form of communication. That is as much as I can say. Nevertheless, as the honourable senator has pointed out, the great bulk of the communications systems were destroyed. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard,</inline> the Minister for Defence, who is responsible for the Natural Disasters Organisation, expressed very great concern about the possibility of this happening again. I presume that he would be the person to whom I should pass on the question for comment. If he is not, I will find out who the appropriate Minister is and I will do that. </para>

I preface it by referring to the stability for rural producers that has been generated by the Government's decision to support a floor price for wool during the current wool selling season. Can he inform the Senate when an announcement may be expected on the Government's intentions in respect of wool marketing in the 1 975-76 wool selling season? </para>

            <para>- It is difficult to make any definitive statement in reply to that question. The Government will need to consult the Australian Wool Corporation and seek its advice before any decision is made on the floor price for the next selling season. I realise that there are 2 sides to the argument about this. There are advantages to the producers in knowing as soon as possible. We realise that. But, on the other hand, it is very difficult for the Corporation to make a judgment of the world market at any length of time prior to 30 June. It will be necessary to strike a balance between these 2 factors. The closer we leave the decision to 30 June, when we will know much more accurately than we know now what the market position will be, the better will be the judgment that the Government will be able to make. I anticipate that by the middle or end of April the Government will be in a position to make a decision on this matter. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. I preface it by joining with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> in saying that the problems concerning the Darwin evacuees were difficult and complex and that I am not in any way trying to be unduly critical. I also preface my question by reminding the Minister that many people who arrived in the major capital cities from Darwin lacked health insurance cover because of the availability of health care from Government doctors in the Northern Territory and that many of them required and still require primary medical care from local suburban doctors, many of whom are treating these people free of charge. Is it a fact that the Department of Social Security decided not to give these people automatic cover under the subsidised health benefits scheme? Will he agree that such action would not be difficult to initiate and would be consistent with a commitment to universal accessibility to health care? In view of the urgent need for the ex-President of Darwin for all kinds of social support, will the Minister undertake to have the situation reviewed? Will the Minister ensure that the community, through its government, will bear the legitimate medical costs of uninsured people evacuated from Darwin as a result of cyclone Tracy? </para>

Upon the arrival from Darwin of evacuees, medical treatment was made available to them from the State authorities and from the hospitals under the jurisdiction of the Department of Repatriation and Compensation, of which there is at least one in each of the State capitals. Further to that, any requests that are made by Darwin evacuees for financial assistance towards private medical expenses not covered by existing insurance or by the pensioner medical service entitlements are considered by the Minister. Evacuees seeking reimbursement for expenses paid or unpaid accounts after any benefits under their existing arrangements are paid are being asked to submit their claims to the Department for consideration on an individual basis. Similar provisions apply in relation to hospital expenses. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> 's question again raises the same sort of problems to which I was referring earlier. Where an evacuee requires medical attention and has not subscribed to one of the hospital or medical benefit funds I am not quite sure what the moral argument is for saying that that evacuee should be treated in a different way from any other person who finds himself in difficulties and has not been a subscriber to one of these funds. The fact of the matter is that the Minister is considering all of these applications and the things have been done to which 1 referred in the course of the answer. It has been announced that applications should be made to the Minister for Social Security through his Department, and in fact this is being done at present. Beyond that, as Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, I personally cannot go. </para>

              <para>-That is right. Obviously the honourable senator knows that, but he may wish to have further details. The conditions of the loans obviously will be for the Loans Commission to decide. The Act itself is broad enough, and I am personally hoping that there will not be a means test. While it is desirable to have a deposit, in certain cases the Commission can lend 100 per cent of the equity in a project without a deposit. Interest charges will be paid and there is discussion between the Loans Commission and myself now about the rate of the interest charges. I am thinking of a charge which will be sufficient to administer the scheme and perhaps to make good losses arising from those who may default on the repayment of loans. </para>

              <para>-The Standing Orders Committee recommends that each of the proposed changes be given a trial period of 6 months. I particularly emphasise that point. We believe it is worth while experimenting with these matters. For that reason the Committee recommends that each of the proposed changes be given a trial period of 6 months. Hence, in the motions which will follow I will be moving that the changes have effect initially as a sessional order and that, unless otherwise ordered, they become amendments to the Standing Orders at the end of 6 months. </para>

I would not go to the barricades and force a division on that aspect of the proposition but it seems to me that it would not require much paper work or mental exercise on the part of the Senate if at the end of that 6 months period the  Clerk,  the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt),</inline> or whoever is handling the matter, were then to move a formal motion for bringing it on. It may well be that this matter could slip under the guard of somebody who wanted to raise an objection and was not here at the normal time.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Kenneth</inline>Anderson does not agree with an item I suppose he will move an amendment to delete that item and any portion which he wants to alter. On that item the question is whether it would automatically become a standing order after 6 months or whether someone would need to move a motion. I think the point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson took is pertinent. At the end of 6 months an item would automatically become a standing order unless someone were apprised of the position and realised that he must give notice of motion to prevent it from becoming a standing order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson's proposal is that after 6 months the question must be asked: Has it worked satisfactorily for 6 months? In his opinion it may have. In my opinion it may not have. In that way we could get an opinion of the Committee of the Whole. Therefore I am inclined to support his proposal rather than the proposal that the items become standing orders automatically. I think that we should be able to move a motion which could be amended so that some items would be adopted and some would be deleted. </para>

            <para>- I agree in principle with the proposition that we have a 6-month trial period. As a member of the Standing Orders Committee, I support that proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson has raised another matter. I think we must consider one factor before we decide, and that is that the Senate may not be sitting at the end of that 6-month period. In that event no opportunity would be available for anyone to move a motion if the items automatically become standing orders after 6 months. It may occur when the Senate is not sitting. The item would automatically become a standing order without the opportunity for objection being available, as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland)</inline> has said would be available. I hope that the Minister will take note of this fact when he moves his motion and will ensure that if the 6-month period elapses when the Senate is not sitting appropriate action can be taken on the first day of sitting by any person who may desire some qualification or some alteration of a standing order because it has not worked satisfactorily. I ask the Minister to take note of that situation. </para>

            <para>-I think the point made initially by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson and then by succeeding speakers has a deal of validity. I think we all appreciate giving the proposals a 6-month trial, at the end of which they will be approved formally if they have met with agreement. If there is some concern there should be a vehicle by which those which have not met with approval can be deleted. Would the Manager of Government Business in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland)</inline> be prepared to amend his suggested motion to provide that these proposed standing orders, as amended, take effect as sessional orders for a 6-month period and that on a date- I suppose it would be a date in August; say 1 1 August or the first sitting day in August- it can be an order of the day that the sessional orders approved on 1 1 February be approved as amendments to the Standing Orders? It would be a vehicle to bring the matter on to the notice paper and to remind people of what has been decided. It could be voted on formally at that time. If people wanted to raise some questions they could give an intimation and propose amendments. It is an attempt on my part to resolve what seems to me to be a difficulty, and it would accord generally with what people are wanting. </para>

            <para>- I have listened with interest to the debate on this matter. Let me say, more for the benefit of the public than for the benefit of the members of this Committee of the whole, that the debate which is taking place is a free debate and the votes which are to be taken are free votes. I mention that fact for the edification of all concerned. I have listened to the remarks of all those who have spoken on this matter. I thought it was the unanimous opinion of the Standing Orders Committee that the procedure suggested by me should be adopted, namely, that we give these proposed standing orders a trial period during the present sittings and, rather than raise them again in toto, if there were no objections they become amendments to the Standing Orders at the end of 6 months. However, I take note of the points made by both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser,</inline> who were members of the Standing Orders Committee which considered the matter. I must now take a consensus of those who have spoken on this matter. Therefore, I am prepared to amend my motion. I shall move: </para>

In fairness to the Minister, I must say that he has not had a chance to consider these matters fully. I think we would achieve the same result by deleting all words after the words 'sessional orders' in the motion which he originally suggested and inserting the words 'and that such sessional orders become motions for amendment to the Standing Orders at the end of 6 months or on the first day of sitting thereafter'. That would mean that there would be a motion, and if anybody wanted to say that he did not think that the sessional orders had succeeded during the trial period he could do so. That would meet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser's</inline> point about the Senate not sitting and my point about giving the Committee of the Whole a chance to vote on each item if any senator is not happy with it at the end of the period. </para><continue><talk.start>

With your indulgence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> perhaps I could get a little off the target of item 1 . As one who sat on the Standing Orders Committee and tried to convene meetings of the Committee for many years I think that much has been accomplished in the work behind the 2 reports that have been presented today. I am in favour of a new standing order 98A., and I support the view that questions can be put to a  chairman  of a committee. I will deal with paragraph (a) of proposed new standing order 98A. in a moment, but I agree with paragraph (b), which states that questions shall not attempt to interfere with the Committee's work or anticipate its report. Paragraph (c) states that the  chairman  shall answer such questions only on the basis that he answers on behalf of the committee and not of himself. There is a slightly grey area in paragraph (c) because in answering a question he may presume to anticipate the report of a committee and he may find subsequently that a member of the committee will repudiate him. I am not going to the barricades on that, but I am most concerned with the proposition which states: </para>

              <para>-Or certainly will happen. I am trying to be very gentle on this issue. Let us assume that a senator asks a question of the  chairman  of a committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President</inline> will say: 'Is leave granted?' Everybody may be in quite a happy and responsive mood, as mostly we are in the Senate, and leave may be granted. But another senator who is not happy with the committee or the answer that the  chairman  of the committee gives- this will emerge subsequently in a debate- may want to ask a difficult question of the  chairman  of the committee. It might not even be supplementary to the answer but probably would be supplementary to bring out another point which the  chairman  has not brought out. When the  President,  as he is bound to do, asks whether leave is granted, in some capricious way one voice could say no. So we could get a distortion which would in essence do damage to the good work that the committee may be doing. I move as an amendment: </para>

I think that in any event that would help to remove a little of the difficulty that could emerge under paragraph (c). As I say, I am not going to the barricades to delete paragraph (c). All our committees are non- party committees in a sense that they work as a team and politics never intrude into the committee work, but it would help to strengthen paragraph (c) if any question to the  chairman  of a committee were put on notice. Quite properly the  chairman  of the committee would have an informal meeting of the committee that day, and with the leave of the Senate, he would be able to give an answer the next day. I am frightened of some questions being asked and leave being given, and some subsequent questions, even supplementary questions, being asked and for some peculiar reason- somebody may have a sore ear or may not be happy with the question asked or the answer given by the  chairman-  leave not being granted. That would do irreparable damage to the work the committees are doing. If I may say so, the committees of the Senate are doing wonderful work. I do not think we should put them at any risk. We should not put a  chairman  at any risk of embarrassment because leave is given to answer one question and then capriciously leave is not given to answer a second question. </para>

Nevertheless I believe that his objections are valid. I see the situation another way. Someone may wish to ask a question of a  chairman  of a committee and the Senate may give leave for the question to be asked, but then the  chairman  of the committee may be in possession of facts which influence him not to answer the question. The  chairman  would be placed in an invidious position in as much as the Senate had said in effect that the  chairman  could be asked questions. The  chairman  could be in possession of facts but he may not be able to answer the question. He would then be placed in an embarrassing situation for the reasons that have been outlined. I believe the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson is quite appropriate. </para>

            <para>- I rise to support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson. I do so because his amendment, if agreed to, would mean that questions may be directed to chairmen of committees only upon notice. The situation will not arise where ad hoc or on the spur of the moment questions are directed to a  chairman  of a committee. This in itself is important because one can get a chain reaction of one question following upon another question. This could place the  chairman  of a committee in an awkward position. I think the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson gives strength to proposed new standing order 98a. (c) which states:  the  Chairman  shall answer such Questions only on the basis that he answers on behalf of the Committee and not of himself. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">If a question is put on notice the  chairman  has time to look at that question. If he is concerned about it he can discuss it and consult with members of his committee before he gives an answer. </para>
          <para>I think that this is a very important matter because the  chairman  is responsible not only to the committee but to his position as  chairman  of that committee. I think it would be most unfortunate if, in trying to give honourable senators the opportunity of finding out the progress of the workings of a committee, we tended to place the  chairman  and members of the committee in an embarrassing situation. I think the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson strengthens and protects the position of both the  chairman  and members of any committee. </para>

            <para>- 1 am opposed to both the motion and the amendment. It is a long time since we have had a discussion on the Standing Orders. Possibly we have a number of new honourable senators who do not know the history of the Standing Orders and alterations which have been made to them. I have been a member of the Senate for 12 years and I have spent much of that time opposing recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders. Most of those recommendations attempted to take away the freedom that honourable senators had in this place when I first came here. I want to refer further to that. I realise that my greatest opponent in trying to preserve the rights of honourable senators is no longer in the Senate. When we discussed this matter in the past I found that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson mostly agreed with my opponents. I thought, for a moment, that today we were getting on very well and that there was a change in the position, but I think the amendment now moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson makes the position even worse than it is at the present time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>An important aspect of this question is that we should alter the Standing Orders only when it has been discovered, by the test of time, that they are not efficient. Those Standing Orders which have been well thought out have been successful. Standing Orders should be altered only when they have been abused. That is the only occasion on which we should attempt to change the Standing Orders. To ask questions of chairmen of committees is not new. Standing Order 98 states that questions may be put to Ministers of the Crown relating to public affairs, and to other senators relating to any Bill, motion, or other matter connected with the business on the notice paper of which such senators may have charge. </para>
          <para class="block">Under that Standing Order honourable senators may ask questions of the  chairman  of a committee. </para>
          <para>If I hear a report about something a committee may be doing and if I wish to ask the  chairman  a question about it, why should I not have the right to do so? If I want the information I think I should be given it. It may be of benefit to the  chairman.  On one occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> who was the  chairman  of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, was asked some questions which suggested that he was holding up a report of the committee so that it would not be released before an election. If the position were that that question had to be put on notice one would have the right to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> had been asked the question and had not answered it. On the occasion to which I have referred <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> had the opportunity to exonerate himself. </para>

              <para>- Yes, but he may not answer it the next day. Therefore he must be given the opportunity to exonerate himself. Such a question may be asked on the last day of the session. If the  chairman  did not have an opportunity to answer on that day that fact could be used by some unscrupulous person in an election campaign. If an honourable senator is the  chairman  of a committee why should he not stand and answer a question asked by another honourable senator who wishes to know what is happening within that committee. </para>

          <para>The motion moved by the Minister for the Media <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland)</inline> could give an occasional right to ask questions- as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson says, when the Senate feels pleasantly disposed to give leave. If proposed standing order 98A. is inserted it will take away the right of honourable senators whether friendly disposed or not- to ask questions of a  chairman  of a committee. Something might be said in the Press which somewhat belittles an individual or the activities of a committee. Surely we should have the arrangement whereby we can clarify the position. I agree that we should not have to ask for leave. The amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson is that such questions may be asked only upon notice unless leave of the Senate is granted for them to be asked without notice. </para>
          <para>I think that the  chairman  of a committee, who is responsible for the committee, has the same right as a Minister to choose how he answers any questions put to him. If he wants to say something which implicates the committee, that is his concern. He has to make the decision as to how he should answer any questions put to him. Members of Parliament should not be stopped from obtaining information they regard as vital. I think that the procedure of placing such questions on notice is entirely wrong. It is further taking away the rights of honourable senators. I hope that both the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland and the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson will be defeated. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir MAGNUS</inline>CORMACK (Victoria) (5.8)- If you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> will entertain my rising to my feet, I would like specifically to answer the question raised by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh).</inline> I admit most frankly and most freely that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> in the years that I have known him in the Senate, has sought vehemently- perhaps more than any other honourable senator- to maintain the rights of honourable senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> learnt how necessary this was in opposition. He, of course, finds himself curbed, I suppose, from time to time. He made the implicit admission a moment ago that when a Minister answers a question he may answer it in his own way. Having said that, I think that the fallacy of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> 's argument can be seen and that his argument falls to the ground. He equates the  chairman  of a committee with a Minister of State who is responsible to the Senate. A  chairman  is not responsible to the Senate. A  chairman  is responsible to his committee and it is the committee which is responsible to the Senate. I think that is the vital difference. It is the committee which is responsible to the Senate and not the  chairman.  The  chairman  is responsible to his committee. </para>
          <para>That was the essence of my rulings when I had the opportunity to sit in the chair. As a result of certain questions being directed to chairmen of committees I ruled that a committee chairman should not be expected to answer questions in the Senate but to express the view of the committee itself when the matter had been brought to the attention of the committee. He could then respond to the Senate expressing the views of the committee and not his own views. I think that the attempt to retain this Standing Order is valid. I think the committee chairmen must be protected. </para>
          <para class="block">They can be protected only if honourable senators acknowledge that the committee is responsible to the Senate and the  chairman  is responsible to the committee. I recommend that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> 's argument should not be accepted. Of course, the other question raises endless possibilities. For example, when does the committee respond to the question asked? We all know, from sitting on one side or other of the Senate, that if Ministers of State do not wish to answer questions they jolly well do not answer them. It is not a matter of whether they will answer in their own way. They take their time about answering questions. Only this afternoon I received an answer to a question which I asked back in July 1974. </para>

            <para>-That is right. We have to wait and wait. Sometimes the cave is cold and draughty. Because of our long experience in the Senate we can raise all sorts of points. We can raise a point in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young.</inline> When he advocated his support for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson, as I listened to him, I made the note: 'Well, when will the question be answered?' Perhaps the Senate would like to pursue that a little further. I think that we have to take the situation as it exists at the present moment, give it an opportunity of 6 month's trial which is the basis of the ultimate paragraph in the report of the Standing Orders Committee, see whether it does work and then, if necessary, take up <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson's argument or the argument adduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> At a later stage the Senate will have an opportunity of either introducing a new standing order or amending the standing order in a way which will find agreement among all honourable senators. While admitting some substance to the arguments of the honourable senators who have spoken against the proposed amendment, in net balance I suggest that, after nearly 10 years of struggling to try to get some sort of an analysis made of the Standing Orders, which are a hangover from an earlier time when the problem confronted the Senate, and which were not anything of the order and nature they are today, we give these proposed standing orders a go. If necessary we can cancel them later. </para>

            <para>- May I quickly respond to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> and to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack. I acknowledge that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> and I sat on the Senate Standing Orders Committee for many years and acted in a non-party way, as we are acting now. We have had great debates on Standing Orders and on the rights and privileges of senators inherent in them. When the honourable senator was speaking in opposition to my amendment he brought out a point. Had he settled for that and not for a complete rejection of my amendment I think I might have tried to work on him a bit. I would have pointed out that this proposed standing order makes flesh of one and fowl of another in terms of the implication of leave. It would have been equitable if the Manager of Government Business in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland)</inline> had said: 'Let us have the same rights for both. If a question is directed to a  chairman  and leave is given, all subsequent questions on the same day to the  chairman  should not require leave'. But it is the inequity which is my basic objection to the proposed standing order. That is why I am taking out the matter of' by leave '. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I come to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack. He said that there was delay in providing answers. But the inequity which I see in the proposed standing order is that we could have the situation where a question might be answered the next day but there could be a delay in answering a subsequent question in perpetuity because an honourable senator is refused leave every time he seeks to answer. So there is a complete delay. The first question could be asked. There might be a little delay in answering but some other honourable senator may not even ask his question because he does not get leave. This is the thing that frightens me. It is true that we will give the proposal 6 months' trial. That is fair enough. I agree with that. I am prepared to go quietly now and have a vote on the matter, if a vote is necessary. But I think we should have the situation so that all honourable senators are equal. It should not be a situation where some honourable senators can have leave and some cannot. The logical answer is for the matter to be put on notice. </para>

            <para>-I desire to support the amendment because I believe this is the only really sensible parliamentary way of dealing with the situation. There are many times when somebody would come along to a  chairman  of a committee and say: 'Tomorrow I will ask you such and such a question.' That is the same as we do to Ministers. Honourable senators on both sides of the chamber do this. We get an answer that day. If we do not give a Minister a tip the question is put on notice and it takes weeks to get an answer. As of today 95 questions out of 428 are unanswered since 9 July last year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson has pointed out his fear about obtaining leave. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> has to ask for leave to ask me as the  chairman  of a committee a question and if I do not want him to ask it I say no and the  President  says: 'Leave is not granted. Put the question on notice.' Under this proposed standing order the  chairman  of a committee has to fulfil the rights of paragraph (c). He has the opportunity to refuse to answer straight away or to give an answer. I believe that that is the right way of going about the matter. </para>

            <para>- I rise again to say a few brief words because it seems that my statements received some criticism. I think honourable senators are only playing with words to say that there is different accountability to the Senate between a Minister and a  chairman  of a committee. That is simply hogwash. Under standing order 98 there is a responsibility on any honourable senator who is in charge of certain business. It need not be a  chairman  of a committee. Any honourable senator has the right to answer a question in relation to a matter of which he is in charge. Some honourable senators want an exemption. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson says that we are denying anyone the right to get up and answer a question off the cuff. He says that because of the inequalities we will give the right to no one. I still make the plea for those who can escape the wroth of the Senate to have their right to ask a question accepted. I also point out to the Senate that, if something arises tomorrow at a committee and if it is imperative that we should have an answer on that day, we should have the machinery so that that question can be asked. </para>

              <para>- I know that is right. It may be that if the Senate were convinced that the question were of such public importance that it should be answered, arrangements could be made to give leave. The honourable senator knows that arrangements are made between the Government and the Opposition. 'Arrangements' is the right word and not 'deals'. The honourable senator would find that there would be occasions when leave could and should be given. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> says that he wants to preserve the chairman's right to dodge his obligation by saying that he will not answer. Of course he can do that in answering. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> did that. He said: 'I want to refer that to my committee. Therefore I ask that the question be placed on notice.' That is easily done. Any honourable senator has the right to get up and ask a question about something on which he wants information or which is propaganda. He has a right to do that in this case. But honourable senators want to take that right away from him now while the person who answers the question will have the box seat by answering how he likes. Of course, all sorts of suggestions could be thrown around that the  chairman  of the committee was afraid to answer because he had been 2 months providing a reply. </para>

              <para>- Yes. I think a question on notice is essential. It seeks information from the person of whom it is asked when that person has not got the information at hand. For the sake of accuracy I think that questions on notice are essential but I think that the person of whom the question is asked should be the one who decides whether it goes on notice. The questioner, because he knows the details but wants a more accurate reply, may still decide to get a more accurate and detailed reply by putting the question on notice. There is a choice. Without this proposed alteration we offer to the  chairman  of a committee the right to put a question on notice, but now it is sought to give him a privilege which we do not give to a senator who has charge of a matter. At present we can ask him questions. </para>

          <para>Some honourable senators are trying to excuse this proposal by saying that it is only on 6 months trial. It would be unusual for a question to be asked of a  chairman  of a committee within the next 6 months. In all probability there will not be a question asked and certain honourable senators then will say that the system operated satisfactorily. There is not a mischief which we seek to remedy. Rules are being inserted just to fill up a rule book. That is the whole purpose of this proposal. Those concerned cannot say where there has been an abuse of the system or where there is a need for a rule. They say only: 'We have a rule which could possibly receive a different interpretation from  President  to  President'.  He who is least governed is best governed. The more rules there are, the greater are the restrictions that we place on senators. It is unfortunate that most of the Senate has to come in and vote without knowledge of the debate that has gone on, but I hope they will not take the attitude of further restricting the rights of senators especially back benchers. </para>

          <para class="block">The Committee will appreciate that there has been in recent times a tremendous development of the Senate committee system. It was with this in mind that the Standing Orders Committee approached this question. All I can do in reply is adopt the arguments put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> who, of course, is not a member of the Standing Orders Committee. I emphasise that this proposal is for a trial period of 6 months. This is a genuine attempt by members of this Senate, representing the various cross shades of political opinion in this chamber, to bring up to date and modernise the existing Standing Orders and, where necessary, improve upon them. After the 6 months trial period senators can then express an opinion on whether the alterations are to be confirmed, amended or deleted. We deliberately included all 3 aspects of proposed standing order 98 (a) after full and detailed consideration. We wanted to protect the right of the individual to seek leave to ask a question. Any member of the Senate at present has that right. He has the right to seek leave to ask a question on any matter. </para>

              <para>-That is why we give notice, of course. But in proposed standing order 98A. (a) we have included the words 'unless leave of the Senate is granted' for the question to be asked without notice. All we say is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson can seek leave to ask a question without notice of a  chairman  of a committee, and if leave is granted he can ask that question but that if leave is not granted he can place the question on the notice paper. It protects the right of a member of this Senate to ask a question. It gives a right to the  chairman  of a committee to refuse leave for a question to be asked, and it also gives to an individual member of the committee the right to say that he wants to be consulted before the  chairman  of the committee of which he is a member gives an answer. They are very important questions. The proposed sessional order has been designed to protect the rights of all members of the Senate. It is for a trial period of 6 months and I propose that the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee be agreed to by this Committee. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSON (New South Wales) (5.27)- In view of what the Minister has said, I think we will have to vote on this proposal. Under standing order 98 as it exists a senator does not need leave and if 98 A. (a) were deleted altogether we would have a situation where there would not be a conflict over whether a senator should or should not get leave. I am glad that the Minister read standing order 98 because it provides that leave is not required. One simply asks a question in the ordinary way.I think we should resolve the matter by way of vote. It is true that the proposal is only for 6 months trial but I do not like the idea of having kissing going by favour in the sense that one person can get leave and another cannot. We all come equal to this place. Incidentally, we would have to seek leave before we state our question. This is the point. Some poor person could have a question of the nature indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> but if somebody says 'no' when he seeks leave to ask if he does not get a chance to say what it is.

            <para>- I now proceed to item 2 of the recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee which relates to the question of how divisions may be called for. Again I indicate that this, if agreed to, is to be taken as a sessional order and that it will be for a trial period of, say, 6 months. Standing order 164 in practice has been interpreted to mean that only those honourable senators challenging the Chair's opinion may call for a division; or, in other words, that those agreeing with the decision of the Chair cannot force a division on the minority if it does not want one. Therefore, in order to clarify the practice it is proposed that there be the following new standing order:  164A: A division shall be called for only by Senators who have given their voices against the majority as declared by the  President. </para>

            <para>- I am worried by this proposed new standing order because I do not think a correct interpretation of standing order 164 is given in the supporting paper. It is my understanding that senators call for a division because there is a tradition that in a parliament, when so required, members stand and be counted. There are many motions moved and amendments made in relation to which it is the desire of an individual, a party or a group that the public know how every member in the Senate voted or did not vote. Therefore, I believe that we would be giving away the right of any honourable senator to make the Senate members stand and be counted to have it go into the records whether such members voted and, if they did vote, how they voted. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is another point that I believe to be in favour of my supposition. It is this: When a division is not called, the vote is taken on the voices. A senator could receive a letter such as one I received recently abusing me up hill and down dale. The letter stated that although I was  Deputy Chairman  of the Senate Select Committee on the Metric System of Weights and Measures I did not vote for the adoption of the metric system. This was because the report was adopted by the unanimous vote of the Senate. No one called for a division and no names appeared in the record. I had to write a long letter explaining parliamentary procedures. Therefore, I believe- I do not want to labour the point- that we must retain the right to have the names of those who vote this way or that way, or who absent themselves from voting, put in the record. </para>

            <para>- I want to make a few remarks which are in complete agreement with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> has said. I think that the Hansard record is the place to record the actions of honourable senators when they are in the Senate chamber. This is a public document compiled to enable those whom we represent to know our behaviour in the Senate chamber. If I am on the successful side of a vote taken in division, I want to prove that I am on the successful side. Of course, matters such as this one arise upon which there is no party instruction. But one could imagine the position more in relation to a Bill such as the Family Law Bill with the different sides pressuring honourable senators. They would do so with the knowledge that a certain senator, because of his religious beliefs, would vote for such and such a proposal. In fact, the senator may not vote that way and he can prove how he voted at any time. We amended this standing order because of that. Honourable senators know that divisions are not called for to see who has the majority in the voting. Everyone knows that when a vote is taken here we have a division to record how senators vote. </para>

              <para>-We had a free vote in relation to that Bill. But honourable senators can remember occasions upon which there was not a free vote in the Senate and, for instance, the Opposition and the Government might have agreed upon something and we had the opposition of the members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party. They would call for a division knowing that the result of it would be 55 votes to 5 votes. The division was called only for the purpose of having the vote recorded in Hansard, and so it should be. </para>

          <para>Then we had the position that the Standing Orders stated that more than one senator had to call for a division. Divisions have been called in which there have been only 2 senators voting the one way. But such senators called for a division because they wanted their votes recorded. We had an exciting experience in January 1 966 when only one senator wanted to vote against a proposal. He wanted his vote recorded. We found that under the Standing Orders he could not do so. So we altered the Standing Orders to make provision for his vote to be recorded in Hansard and he voted against the proposal. We have always acted on the principle that the Senate is a public forum and that what is done here shall be known to the people who elect us. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> raised the case of someone accusing him of not voting a certain way because that person did not see his name recorded in Hansard as voting that way. I suppose that it could be said that honourable senators could be satisfied if they voted on the successful side in deciding a question. But one is not satisfied with that position. For example, we want to prove to the wine growers of the Murray region how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> voted in relation to the wine tax. The Standing Orders Committee wants to deny us this right. The whole records of Hansard are for that very purpose. The Committee wants to take away that right and hide the actions of members of the Senate. It is not right. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSON (New South Wales) (5.37)- I am in some difficulty in the light of what I have heard in the debate. It is a bit of a paradox that the proposed Standing Order states that senators, having won a vote on the voices, cannot call for a division because they have won it. I suppose that that is fairly natural under normal circumstances. If a vote is won on the voices as declared by the  President  or the  Chairman  of Committees, the senators who have won the vote will not say that they want a division. But there are circumstances in which a division may be wanted. A situation could arise in which members of a senator's party have spoken against that senator and then they may shelter under the fact that the vote is taken on the voices. I suppose that there is some truth in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> have said, namely, that any senator has a right to call for a division. There could be a whole variety of reasons why such a senator would want to call for a division. </para>

              <para>-But the situation could arise in which a senator who is an 'aye' voter and not a ' no' voter may want to have his vote recorded even though the Chair has declared the result in favour of the 'ayes'. That person may also wish to record the vote of some others who are sheltering under the fact that the vote is taken on the voices. I appreciate the wording of the proposed new Standing Order a little, but I think that the position is a little difficult. Circumstances could arise in which there was a little internecine warfare inside the party and it might be desirable that a vote be taken. </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir MAGNUS</inline>CORMACK (Victoria) (5.39)- I would like to make some observations on this matter. This whole question of when a division shall be called or when it shall not be called is a most vexing one. The traditions of parliament for hundreds of years, involved in the problems of the nation as they are- in Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa or wherever it is- have been that parliament does not always force a division on a question it carries a great part of its business on the voices. Such questions are carried on the voices simply because the views of parliamentarians are known to each other and they are willing to have the business despatched by the cry. That is why the presiding officer says: 'Those of that opinion say "aye".' He is not ordering a division. The presiding officer says 'Those of that opinion say "aye", to the contrary "no",' and then he makes the declaration, for example, that the 'ayes ' have it. I ask honourable senators to bear in mind that Parliament, as I mentioned earlier, desires to carry a lot of its business on the voices. The Senate decides quite often to carry its business on the voices. When a couple of senators indicate to the  President  or the  Chairman  that they want a division they are in fact saying that the Presiding Officer or the  Chairman  has given the wrong decision. A request for a division is, in essence, saying that the Presiding Officer or the  Chairman  of Committees has given the wrong call. That is the essence. It has been a ruling of many Presiding Officers for years and one to which I finally submitted I thought the ruling was wrong but experience dictated to me that in the end the tradition is right- that those who are calling for a division must put their foot where their tongue is. That is the essence of the matter. If honourable senators want to force a division they can go to the appropriate side of the House. Therefore they just cannot graciously divide the Senate. That is the reason for the proposed standing order which is before the Committee at present.I suggest to honourable senators that if they agree to this proposal they will not find their rights in any way destroyed. They can always get a division. They can always put their foot where their mouth is and relieve the Presiding Officer, the Temporary  Chairman  of Committees, the  Deputy President  or whoever is in the Chair in an extraordinarily difficult situation. I reinforce the recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee and ask the Committee of the Whole to adopt this proposed standing order. </para>

            <para>-  Is not the plain fact of life that a person who is in favour of a given motion and desires to have his name recorded as being in favour of that motion has no right at all to insist upon a division being taken? That, I think, is not just. There comes the occasion when, for a particular reason, a given member may desire to have recorded very clearly how the vote went, particularly as it concerns him. He has no right at all to do that unless he agrees with the minority. </para>

            <para>-  Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack I completely argue against and reject the assertion that by asking for a division after the Presiding Officer has indicated that either the ayes or the noes have it an honourable senator is challenging the hearing, the sense or the fairness of the  President.  I was going to say it is utter nonsense but I will be kinder than that; that is something with which I cannot agree. My reason for calling for a division is to find out which honourable senators are present and which way they are voting. There is the run-off of whether the  Chairman  or the Presiding Officer was right in his decision. It is wrong to expect the Presiding Officer to trust his hearing facilities. If the Presiding Officer had to do so in many cases he would never give a decision because honourable senators hardly ever indicate their attitude to the question unless their tempers are frayed. For goodness sake leave standing order 164 as it is and interpret it as it is. It should not be interpreted in the way other people would wish to have it interpreted. </para>

          <para class="block">Committee, has merely expressed the point of view which indeed has the unanimous agreement of the members of the Standing Orders Committee.

In no other Parliament in the world that pursues the Westminster system- this applies to State parliaments throughout Australia and to the House of Commons- can the winning side force a division on the losing side. </para>
          <para>The principle of calling for a division is for the purpose of virtually challenging the ruling given by the Chair in declaring as to the way that the greatest number of people voted.

All that the Committee is doing by this proposed new standing order is to carry out, in effect, what has been custom and practice for a number of years and which, as I say, has been adopted in all other parliaments which follow the Westminster system. </para>

              <para>- It may have been amended, but I am advised that the principle nonetheless was not changed. It has always been custom and practice that the right to challenge the Chairman's decision and call for a division rests with the minority. This proposal is for a trial period of 6 months. We are clarifying the position to conform to custom and practice. Therefore I suggest that the Committee's recommendation be agreed to. </para>

Because of the extensions to the Parliament House building some rooms are located some distance from the Senate chamber. Honourable senators who have been in committee rooms Nos1 and 2 on the House of Representatives side and have found that they have had 2 minutes in which to get to this chamber for a division have felt that they should have been in training for the Olympic Games in order to get to this chamber in time. The Committee recommended that the ringing of division and quorum bells should be extended from the present 2 minutes to 3 minutes. However, the Committee has also recommended that time could be saved by ringing the division bells for only one minute when there are successive divisions without intervening debate, such as when the question is put following the application of the closure. We all have had the experience where successive divisions have taken place in this chamber and on each occasion we have had to sit here and wait for the ringing of the bells for another 2 minutes before the next division could be taken. We believe that the implementation of this recommendation would be a practical way of trying out a new experiment until such time as it can be written permanently into the Standing Orders. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para>

            <para>- Item 4 relates to the suspension of Standing Orders to elem in ate delays in the passage of Bills. The Standing Orders Committee has suggested that its recommendations should be agreed to, again for this trial period.

            <para>That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Bill being passed through all its stages without delay. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">Whilst the Committee recognises that the Standing Orders were framed in order to prevent surprise and haste, it considers that the continuation of the practice of regularly seeking suspension of the Standing Orders in connection with the consideration of Bills that are received from the House of Representatives is undesirable and that the procedure for expediting the passage of such Bills, when necessary, should be regulated by the Standing Orders. Accordingly, after the Standing Orders Committee had given due consideration to the matter, it made the following recommendation to the Committee of the Senate as a Whole:  23 1A. With respect to Bills received from the House of Representatives, a Motion, that the Bill may be taken through all or its remaining stages without delay, may be moved by a Minister of the Crown at any time without Notice. Such a resolution shall suspend any requirements for the three readings of a Bill to take place on separate sitting days and Standing Orders 2 10 and 2 15 shall not apply. </para><para class="block">So far as Bills that are initiated in the Senate are concerned, it is considered that any necessary expedition of their consideration should be sought by leave or by a suspension of the Standing Orders, as at present. The point of view of the Standing Orders Committee is that this constant moving of the motion that so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent a Bill being passed through all its stages without delay becomes a bit repetitive and cumbersome. We suggest that the new procedure is worth while trying. Therefore I move: </para><motion>

            <para>- From memory, when a Minister has a Bill to present to this chamber he stands up and moves the motion that so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Bill being passed through all its stages without delay. The person occupying the Chair puts the motion and he says: 'Those in favour say aye, to the contrary no, the ayes have it'. The Bill is read a first time. The Minister then makes his second reading speech and the debate is adjourned. </para>

By agreement between the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the custom is that the messages repose with the  Clerk  at the Table who holds them, as it were, in custody for the  President. </para>
          <para>The reality is that the Senate should be, and undoubtedly is, protected by its  President  because a message cannot be read to the Senate except by the  President  who is the only recipient of messages from the House of Representatives and the only person who can convey messages to the House of Representatives. I agree that what is recommended would cut out what might amount to circumlocution. If there is any concern as to whether the Senate can be protected against surprise, the fact is that the Presiding Officer is there to protect the Senate and in fact should protect the Senate. I doubt whether any  President  would take any other attitude than that it is his duty to protect the Senate. </para>

            <para>- All that is proposed is the elimination of 23 words which I have heard used in regard to every Bill presented in the last 2 1 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> years, and the formal motion which follows its presentation. It is traditional. I cannot remember any other circumstances in which they have been said. It is traditional to use the words: 'that so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Bill being passed through all its stages without delay'. Then honourable senators are asked whether they are in favour and the motion is declared carried or not carried. I do not know how many seconds it takes to say those words but that can be timed if someone wants to do so. Through the years in this Parliament the Government has had the right to proceed or not to proceed with a Bill. But if we remove those words we will be flying blind because we do not know whether that can happen. We would not know whether so much of the Standing Orders would be suspended as to enable the Government to push a Bill through or whether the Government would go through the normal procedure. Traditionally those words have been used and then the Leader of the Opposition has been permitted to move the adjournment of the debate on the Bill until the next day. Is that not the procedure? </para>

              <para>-That is what happens. I have hear those words used. In fact as a Cabinet Minister and a Minister of State for 9 years I had to use those words every time I introduced a Bill. That meant that the Government, or the Minister handling the Bill, had the options. We all knew that by the use of those words the Minister had the options. Now it is proposed that they be taken out so that we will not know whether the Minister will use the options. An honourable senator may want to move a motion for the adjournment of the debate after the second reading of a Bill when suddenly, out of the blue, something else may happen. The Minister in charge of the Bill may say: Oh well, when we get to a certain stage the debate will be adjourned until the next day'. We knew that that would happen because the words are in the Standing Orders. If what is proposed in this motion is accepted it will mean that we will not know what will happen. We will be flying blind. We will probably think that the ordinary procedure will be followed so that the Leader of the Opposition or somebody else can move a motion for the adjournment of the debate at the second reading stage or when we go into committee. If what is suggested is accepted we will never know what is to happen until it happens. </para>

              <para>-Yes. I would not go to the barricades over this proposals either because I think it is one of the least important that our Standing Orders Committee has brought forward. It has been brought forward only because some Ministers do not like the jargon. I have heard a Leader of the Government say: 'Let us cut out the jargon'. The fact is that those words were inserted to warn honourable senators that they may face a situation when a Bill could go straight through without delay. The passage of this proposal will mean that they will not have any warning. If that is what honourable senators want I will not vote against it but I would like to see the standing order left as it is. </para>

            <para>- I think I probably would be repeating myself if I replied to what has been put. So far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> is concerned, it is not so much a question of the saving of time that is involved but the saving of a repetition of words. We are trying to avoid the constant and, we believe, undesirable necessity for the suspension of Standing Orders and the usual procedure that is involved in moving that so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would enable certain things to be done. We are seeking to have the usual procedure regulated and recognised by the Standing Orders. As I have said, there is no question of saving time so far as the 2 procedures are concerned, the existing procedure and what is proposed. Really, the 2 procedures achieve the same result. We are trying to regularise or formalise within the framework of the Standing Orders the procedure that now exists for the suspension of Standing Orders. What is proposed will be moved at the time the usual motion is moved that so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Bill being passed through all its stages without delay. We merely suggest that instead of doing that in a repetitive form we formalise the matter by way of proposed new standing order 231a. Therefore I suggest that the Committee adopt the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee. </para>

The Standing Orders Committee considered the question of the calling of meetings of committees and the absence of a rule for the requisitioning of meetings. In order to overcome this problem the Standing Orders Committee suggested proposed new standing order 297a which states:  297a. Notice of meetings subsequent to the first meeting shall be given by the  Clerk  attending the Committee (a) pursuant to resolution of the Committee, (b) on instructions from the  Chairman,  or (c) upon a request by a Quorum of Members of the Committee: Provided that, in Committees consisting of less than seven Senators, the request is made by not less than three Members of the Committee. </para>

              <para>- I know there is another report. Did the Committee consider only what is contained in the 2 reports? I have always considered that standing order 28 1 was wrong in its application, and in saying that I am not being critical of the  President  or yourself. I have been a member of other organisations and I have always believed that the motion, that the question be now put, always had to be moved by someone who had not spoken in the debate. The procedure in the Senate is entirely different. I was appalled when I first came here to hear somebody say some very unkind things about the Opposition or the Government, as the case may be, and then with 2 minutes to go move that the question be put. I think it is entirely wrong because it gives nobody an opportunity to answer what has been said. I am fortified in that belief by reason of the fact that when there was a joint meeting of the 2 Houses that point was made very clear. No one who had spoken in a debate was permitted to move 'That the question be now put'. It is unfair to this extent - </para>

          <para class="block">The <inline font-weight="bold">CHAIRMAN (Senator Webster)Perhaps</inline> I should have called you to order earlier in your remarks to the Committee. Basically we are dealing with 2 reports from the Standing Orders Committee. Whilst I think it is fair for you to mention one standing order on which you have some comment, I think it would be as well if we considered the 2 reports of the Standing Orders Committee. We are about to commence consideration of the second report which is, in fact, the third report for the 56th session. If your question was whether the Standing Orders Committee had dealt with any other matters, I can assure you that it has dealt at length with a number of standing orders and has been unable to come to finality on many of them. I think your comment, when read in Hansard, will prove a prompting point for the Committee. I think the Manager of Government Business should proceed to the third report, and we will deal with that matter. The comment which you have made can be taken into account by the Standing Orders Committee. </para>

            <para>- I find it a little difficult to be clear in my mind on the amount of time which will be saved by this procedure. After all is said and done, on how many occasions do senators ask that the answers to questions on notice be read? I would suggest that it is most infrequently. The time saved would be negligible. I believe that a senator has the undisputed right, for any reason at all, political or otherwise, to read the question which he has put on notice and to have the answer read, and I do not think that right should be interfered with. This morning we had a series of questions on notice answered. Without counting them, there were about 25. Only one senator asked that the answer be read. I think I am interpreting correctly the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee. I believe that a senator should have the right to ask his question on notice and to have the answer read by the responsible Minister. </para>

              <para>- It does not matter whether it is Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. That is not the point.I believe that a senator has the undisputed right to ask a question which he has put on notice. I do not look at the politics of it.

          <para class="block">Senate it has frequently happened that a question has been asked without notice and the Minister in his reply, because there are ingredients in the question which it is apparent to everybody will call for information from his departmental advisers, has said: 'I suggest to the honourable senator that he put the question on notice'. In these circumstances, the honourable senator who asked the question has had to write it out. He may also have 3 other questions that he wants answered without notice before he writes out the question that has to be placed on notice. When does the  Clerk  put the question without notice on the notice paper? What is the order? Does he put it on when the Minister says: 'I suggest that it be put on notice'? Does he put it on notice then, and does the senator by response say: 'Yes,I will do that'? On the other hand, does he wait until it is scribbled out, rechecked, corrected and altered sometimes before it goes on the notice paper? These are little things, but sometimes they arise. </para>
          <para>I agree that a few matters need to be cleared up, particularly as to the old standing order 102. I think it is fair to say that in the world in which we are living parliamentary practice in Australia has become more vigorous and more active than it was when the Standing Orders were written. We cannot have a situation in which all questions on notice are read and the replies are then given. During the life of this Government in the last 2 years reforms have been carried out, by common consent rather than by alterations of the Standing Orders, which have tended to shortcut the delay, but we always observed the reservation that if a senator wanted the answer to his question read he should be able to exercise his right to have that done. That seems to me to have worked reasonably well. It may well be that in the light of delays in receiving answers it is sometimes a bit absurd for a Minister to read out an answer to a question which has been put on notice many months before. On balance, I agree with the recommendation, but I would like to hear the Minister on the ingredient which is proposed to be removed from the old standing order 102. </para>

            <para>- I oppose this recommendation and I will make a few preliminary remarks about how this discussion has gone. We have accepted a declaration by the Chair on whether a motion on the first report we dealt with today was carried or lost. That is not a matter on which I am questioning the decision of the Chair. I think that is a matter which at some time will have to be decided by getting all senators to vote. Any move in 6 months time to incorporate in Standing Orders the 2 matters I oppose will have to be the subject of a division. In the meantime I do not think that the 2 questions I opposed in the first report we dealt with will come up for consideration during the 6-month trial period, and I do not think there will be any indication during that 6 months of whether they are beneficial or not. If any question is decided on the voices in my favour during that 6 months period, I will have to ask for a division, although I will be denied it under this rule, and be refused an opportunity to show in the records how I stood on the matter. Otherwise the Hansard record will not give any indication of how I voted. </para>

              <para>- It is the information sheet which shows that I have never voted contrary to what I claim to the electors that I have voted. I cannot escape into the coward 's castle by saying: 'We will not record it in Hansard'. This is a question on which I fought some time ago. There is nothing in the Standing Orders at present that suggests that a senator should read a question on notice. We seem to be guided, firstly, by Standing Orders and, secondly, by the practice and tradition of the Senate. Until I came into the Senate it had always been the practice that if a senator wanted to ask a question without notice he read it. If questions on notice were to be incorporated in Hansard senators had to ask leave to have them incorporated. Obviously questions on notice became too numerous. Standing orders 98 to 103 deal with questions. There is no difference between answering a question without notice and answering a question on notice. The answer is given in the same way. Standing order 101 states: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Notice of Question shall be given by a <inline font-weight="bold">Senator delivering</inline> the same at the Table, fairly written, printed, or typed, signed by himself, and showing the day proposed for asking such Question, or such Notice may be given by one <inline font-weight="bold">Senator on</inline> behalf of another. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That permits me to submit a question on behalf of a colleague or to put a question on notice if I want more detailed information and want to give the Minister time to reply. But there is nothing in the Standing Orders about replies to questions. It is assumed that questions on notice shall be replied to as set out in standing order 98, which states that a senator may ask a question. Standing order 102 deals with the issue that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson brought up- the right of a senator to ask a question on behalf of an absent senator. The intention is to delete that standing order. At the present time standing order 102 states: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">That immediately implies that it was the intention of the Standing Orders that a senator should ask such questions verbally. Standing Order 103, which we seek to delete, states: </para>

          <para class="block">It was always implied by those rules that a question on notice is only for the purpose of getting more accurate information or getting details which a Minister could not supply immediately or which it was unreasonable to expect him to supply immediately. </para>
          <para>During my time as a member of the Standing Orders Committee it became apparent that questions on notice were taking up too much time of the Parliament and the Standing Orders Committee considered a recommendation- the same as we are considering now- that questions on notice should be incorporated in Hansard and not read. Asking questions is important to some individuals. Some honourable senators may want it known that they have asked a question. Although the answer may be published in Hansard they would like the questions to be heard over the air if the Senate proceedings are being broadcast. Honourable senators may want the public to hear the answer to their questions. They may wish to wake up a sleepy reporter in the Press gallery who perhaps would not notice the question if it were published only in the Hansard record. If an honourable senator asks a question about Victoria and it is of interest to the Victorian newspapers, by the question being asked in the House it is brought to the attention of the Press. </para>
          <para>A number of honourable senators in this place insist on their questions being answered by the Minister concerned. I think that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Temporary Chairman,</inline> like your questions on notice to be asked verbally and to be answered verbally. I think the  Chairman  of Committees, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> who sits on the other side of the House, is another honourable senator who likes his questions to be answered in this manner. I do not know what value the honourable senators get out of this but it is important to them. </para>

Proposed new standing orders 102 and 103 will mean that honourable senators will not be able to acquaint the listening public of their questions. They will not be able to direct the attention of reporters in the Press gallery to questions dealing with their district. Therefore, the questions placed on notice and their answers will be covered up in Hansard. Such questions will be in small print and honourable senators will have to hope that someone will read the questions they have asked. </para>

That system has been operating for some time now. It has been operating successfully. That arrangement is not a part of Standing Orders but it gives satisfaction to honourable senators who want to ask their questions in the Senate, lt gives complete satisfaction to them. Proposed new standing orders 102 and 103 would deprive such individuals of the right to ask a question which has been placed on notice. Why? Is it taking up too much time? Of course, if a Minister answers a question which has been placed on notice and the answer is long and contains many details, the Minister may ask for the answer to be incorporated in Hansard.

I asked a question in October. The Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee)</inline> was good enough to give me the opportunity to ask that question this afternoon. I let that opportunity go by but I did receive a number of copies of the answer. </para>
          <para>The custom in this place for some time has been that any honourable senator can get in the voice of the Minister an answer to a question which has been placed on notice and he can also receive numerous copies of the answer so that the media, if it so desires, can publish the answer. In that way the public can become aware of the answer to the question that the honourable senator has raised on their behalf. If proposed new standing orders 102 and 103 are passed I am fearful that I will receive only one copy of the answer to any questions I may place on notice. Where have I got the support staff to make other copies in order to give them to the media and to send them to people who have asked me to ask these questions? Is this an effort to silence or handicap honourable senators and to prevent them from publicising the answers to questions that they have put in this national Parliament? I know that answers to questions placed on notice go into the Hansard record, but if honourable senators try to post a copy of Hansard to an elector who lives across the street it will cost 33c to do so. </para>
          <para>I feel quite confident that this new item will be passed and will have a trial period of 6 months. If we press for a division, as this matter has not been caucuses and the vote would be a non-party vote, honourable senators will come into this chamber without being aware of the subject we are debating. They will have a look at where Charlie is sitting and we will not achieve the result that we should in the national Parliament. I am right on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> 's side in this matter. I believe there is creeping in an influence to silence or handicap members of the Senate in order to prevent them from getting information and providing it to the public. I am not allowed to cast a reflection on a vote of the Senate but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> got away with it, and I support what he said about that too. </para>

            <para>- This has been a very interesting debate. I can recall, when I was in Opposition, making exactly the same sort of speech that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> has just made. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> that this is a non-political event and that the members of the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders represented a wide spectrum of the views of this Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson referred to existing standing order 102 which states: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">As I pointed out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson, that particular standing order was adopted by the Senate on 1 1 June 19 14. Of course, if this new procedure is adopted none of the questions that have been placed on the notice paper will be asked by a senator. Therefore, as all questions that have been placed on the notice paper will not be asked in the Senate it becomes redundant to say that an honourable senator acting on behalf of another honourable senator may ask a question that has been placed on the notice paper. </para>

              <para>- I suppose we could have that, but why? The simple reason is that all questions that are on the notice paper will be put on the notice paper by the  Clerk  in the order in which he receives them. </para>

          <para class="block">When the  Clerk  receives the answer a reply will be provided by him to the honourable senator who asked the question. On the aspect to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> has addressed himself, namely, that an honourable senator might get only one copy of the question which he has asked and of the answer which is given, I point out that the simple fact is that at present about 35 copies of a question and an answer are supplied to the attendant by the Minister. The attendant offers them to the honourable senator who originally asked the question. Copies are distributed around the Senate chamber at times. Copies get into the Press Gallery and then they are available for public consumption. I point out that existing standing order 103 states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>When Notices of Questions are given, the  Clerk  shall place them at the commencement of the Notice Paper, according to the order in which they were delivered at the Table, and the Reply shall be handed to him in writing, when given. </para>

          <para class="block">I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> will agree that 'the reply' means a number of copies of the reply.

I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> in that time can see whether he is given a copy or a number of copies. I suggest that the Committee's report be adopted. </para>

        <para>I wish to report to the House and to the Australian people on my recent mission abroad. It was, I believe, the most arduous and comprehensive overseas visit ever undertaken by an Australian Prime Minister. It was also among the most necessary and productive. From Australia 's point of view it was long overdue; in each of the countries I visited it was welcomed without reservation. It enabled me to put Australia's views, to hear the views of our friends and trading partners and to strengthen our good will in regions of undoubted importance to us. I count it an unqualified success. </para>
        <para>Between 14 December and 21 January I visited Sri Lanka, Belgium, the headquarters of the European Communities in Brussels, Britain, Ireland, Greece, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, the Federal Republic of Germany, Pakistan and Bangladesh. I had intended also to visit Malta, but because of my return to Australia after the disaster in Darwin, the Special Minister of State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bowen,</inline> who accompanied me throughout my mission, visited Malta in my stead. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bowen</inline> and I were accompanied by a team of senior officials, including the Secretary of the Department of Minerals and Energy, the Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade, the  Deputy  Secretary of my own Department, and for part of our visit, a First Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department. </para>
        <para>It will be seen from the duration of my trip, from the number and range of the countries visited and from the number and seniority of the officials who accompanied me, how highly I rated the importance of this mission and the tasks I undertook on Australia's behalf. No Australian Prime Minister had visited the Soviet Union in the 33 years since diplomatic relations were established between the Soviet Union and Australia. Many of the other countries I visited had not previously been visited by an Australian Prime Minister. Yet the nations of the European Economic Community constitute Australia's second largest trading partner after Japan. The Soviet Union is one of the world's two superpowers one of the nations whose policies determine the fate of all mankind. More than1½ million citizens have come to Australia from the nations of continental Europe. We share with many of the countries I visited economic and social problems which it was clearly in our interests to discuss together. </para>
        <para>I saw my mission as an essential part of my duty as a Head of Government. It had already been postponed for 6 months because of the action of the Opposition in refusing supply and forcing an election last May. I did not believe it should be postponed again. Quite apart from the inconvenience and disruption this would have caused to the Governments I visited, the issues we discussed were so important, so pressing, so central to Australia's immediate and long-term interests, that a further postponement could not be contemplated. </para>
        <para>I stress that point because, for some weeks, the Australian people witnessed a persistent and often unscrupulous campaign by sections of the media to deter me <inline font-style="italic">from</inline> my visit, and when I was not deterred, to disparage what I did. The specious view was put forward that a Prime Minister's duty is to stay at home at a time of economic difficulty. Now however serious our own problems and however acute my concern about them- and I trust my concern is not in question I believe a Prime Minister, in the nature of his office, has a special and at times an overriding duty to promote Australia's place in the world. This is not to say that our economic problems are unimportant. I agree that domestic matters, inflation and unemployment, have a greater priority in our thinking and are more important to the nation's welfare than any of the matters with which I had to deal overseas. The point is really this: While it was possible for my colleagues to deal with our domestic problems in my absence, it was not possible for anyone other than the Prime Minister to deal with the matters that arose during my mission. That is the crux of the matter. In all the denigration of my visit I have not seen this point acknowledged, let alone refuted. Only a visit by a Head of Government enables Australia to put her point of view at the highest level and in the most forceful terms. Only a visit by a Head of Government obliges the countries visited to clarify and co-ordinate their policies towards us. Only a visit that includes all European countries or at least the majority of those of importance to us- can generate a cumul.tive impact and promote Australia's advantage on the widest scale. </para>
        <para>Our economic problems, far from being irrelevant to the matters discussed on my trip, in fact bore closely upon them. One of the themes of my mission was the essential and growing interdependence of nations in dealing with their economic problems. It would have been curious indeed if I had given the impression to our friends and trading partners, by cancelling or again postponing my trip, that Australia is the only country whose problems can be isolated from the rest of the world. The whole point of my mission, the point persistently ignored by the critics, was that Australia cannot isolate herself. Our inflation and unemployment are to a large extent linked with the present economic recession in the United States and much of Western Europe. I left Europe with the feeling that despite our temporary difficulties Australia's economy is healthier and basically sounder than those of most of the countries I visited. I left Europe with the sure knowledge that the management of the Western monetary system and the Western economy is, along with the maintenance of peace, the greatest and most immediate problem of 1975. In meeting that problem, Australia, like every other advanced industrialised nation, has a part to play. </para>
        <para>For the information of honourable members I shall give a brief outline of my itinerary and official discussions before dealing with particular issues. I left Sydney on 14 December and made an initial stop in Sri Lanka, where I had talks with  President  Go pal law a and Prime Minister Bandaranaike. The following day I flew to Brussels for a stay of 4 days, during which I was received by Their Majesties the King and Queen of Belgium and had discussions with Prime Minister Tin de mans. I had talks in Brussels with the  President  of the Commission of the European Communities, M Or to li, and with the Vice-President, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Christopher</inline> Soames. I addressed the International Press Centre there on 18 December. I shall seek leave tomorrow to table the texts of this and other speeches made during my trip and the texts of cultural and other agreements that I signed on Australia's behalf. </para>
        <para>On 1 9 December I flew to London for a 5-day visit, which included an audience with  Her  Majesty the Queen of Australia and discussions with Prime Minister Wilson and the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Heath.</inline> I sought to define Australia's relations with Britain in my speech at the Mansion House at a luncheon given by the Lord Mayor of London. On 23 December I paid a short visit to the Irish Republic for talks with the Taoiseach, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cosgrave,</inline> and other senior ministers. I was also received by  President  O'Dalaigh. On my return to Europe I visited Greece, where I had talks on 3 January with the recently elected Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karamanlis.</inline> The same evening I flew to The Hague for a 2-day visit. There I was received by  Her  Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands and had talks with Prime Minister Den Uyl and other senior ministers. On 6 January I went to Paris for 2 days of talks with  President  Giscard d 'Estaing, Prime Minister Chirac and other French ministers. In Paris I attended a ground-breaking ceremony at the site of the new Australian embassy building and a civic reception in the Hotel deville. I had talks with the Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, whose headquarters are in Paris. </para>
        <para>From Paris 1 travelled to Rome, where I had discussions with  President  Leone and Prime Minister Moro, the Foreign Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rumor,</inline> and several other senior ministers. During my visit to Rome I signed a cultural agreement between Australia and Italy. I flew next to Yugoslavia, the first Australian Prime Minister to visit that country. I had talks on 9 and 10 January with Prime Minister Bijedic and met  President  Tito. On 12 January I flew to Leningrad and 2 days later to Moscow where I had wide-ranging discussions with  President  Podgorny and Prime Minister Kosygin of the Soviet Union, and signed cultural and scientific agreements between the Soviet Union and Australia. I visited the Federal Republic of Germany from 16 to 18 January. In Bonn I met  President  Sch eel and had talks with Chancellor Schmidt and other senior ministers. I addressed a meeting of bankers and industrialists at the Federation of German Industry in Cologne on 16 January. On my way back to Australia I paid a brief visit to Pakistan on 19 January for talks with Prime Minister Bhutto, and Bangladesh, where I met Prime Minister- now President Sheikh Mujib Rah man. Joint communiques were issued after my visits to Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union which I shall seek leave to table. </para>
          <para>European Economic Community- Uranium</para>
        <para>It became apparent as my visit to the 7 European Economic Community countries progressed that Western Europe's demand for uranium in the late 1970s and the 1980s will be very substantial. Our role as a potential major supplier of uranium means that Australia's importance to these countries will increase. In Brussels, London, The Hague, Paris, Rome and Bonn, as well as in Moscow, I consistently asserted Australia 's wish to develop its own enrichment capability so that as much uranium as possible should be exported in an enriched form. There are important policy issues to be resolved, such as the choice of enrichment technology, the capital investment required and the extent to which we may be prepared to sell unenriched uranium both before and after we have our own enrichment capability. I am convinced that my visit, and the fact that the Head, of the Department of Minerals and Energy, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt, accompanied me, has greatly facilitated the Government's consideration of the total uranium supply and demand situation over the next decade. The obvious interest shown throughout Europe in Australia as a supplier of uranium suggests that we shall exercise considerable influence in this important area. </para>
          <para>The European Economic Community -Beef</para>
        <para>In each European Community capital 1 took up forcefully the Community's current import restrictions on beef. I left heads of government in no doubt about our attitude to the Community's action in imposing restrictions without warning or consultation. I pointed out the disruptive and harmful nature of this action to the Australian meat industry and urged on European leaders the need for stable long-term marketing arrangements. The response of individual governments was, in the main, apologetic and sympathetic. I believe that my visit has made it more likely that the Community market will be re-opened to Australian beef, if not later this year, then by mid- 1976. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> was informed that the total market could return to about 400 000 to 500 000 tons by mid- 1 976. This total market, of which we would have a share, would mean that we would be still selling less beef than we did before the market was closed, but it is an improvement. I also believe that the strong stand which I took on this matter and the interest of the European countries in Australian uranium will make it much less likely that such restrictive actions will be taken against Australian commodities again. </para>
          <para>Energy</para>
        <para>In a number of countries I discussed in some depth the energy crisis and the Middle East. I assured European leaders that, while we agreed that an increase in the price of oil was justified, we did not wish to see a confrontation develop between cartels of producers and consumers. I asserted strongly our attitude that, while producers have every right to negotiate with consumers for fair prices for their resources, we will also work to harmonise the interests of producers and consumers with proper concern for the international situation as a whole. </para>
          <para>The Middle East</para>
        <para>In my discussions on the Middle East I asserted the right of all countries in the Middle East, including Israel, to secure and recognised boundaries. I believe that Israel's integrity as a state must be upheld. At the same time, a lasting solution in the Middle East will require withdrawal from occupied territories and measures to meet the legitimate needs of the Palestinian people. While I cannot go into the details of private discussions, I was not discouraged by my discussions in the Kremlin and in Belgrade on this matter. </para>
          <para>The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</para>
        <para>I took the opportunity in a number of capitals to urge greater support for the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty. In particular I did so in Paris, Bonn and Rome. Australia wants to see the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty strengthened and all countries accept the multilateral obligations which the Treaty embodies. I sensed that there is a real possibility of movement by the governments in Rome and Bonn, which is most encouraging. In France I explained frankly the problems of selling uranium to countries which had not ratified the NPT or adhered to the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Although France has not signed the NPT I believe that she too is concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons and I hope that she too will sign. Meanwhile, France has said that she will behave as if she were a party to the NPT and that she already applies the safeguards adopted by the International Atomic Energy Agency. </para>
          <para>The Non-Aligned Movement</para>
        <para>I discussed with <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Bandaranaike</inline> in Sri Lanka and with  President  Tito and Prime Minister Bijedic in Yugoslavia Australia's interest in the Third World and the non-aligned movement. Although Australia is an aligned country- and there can be no doubt about this- we have interests which overlap those of the Third World. Many of the non-aligned countries- like Sri Lanka- are within or on the borders of the Indian Ocean. I explained to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Bandaranaike, President</inline> Tito and Prime Minister Bijedic our interest in attending future meetings of the nonaligned group either as a guest or as an observer. I found all three appreciative of the interest of Australia in the problems of the Third World and the objectives of the non-aligned movement and sympathetic to our association as a guest or as an observer with future meetings. </para>
        <para>We shall in the future be examining further the possibilities of our attendance in this capacity at future meetings of the non-aligned countries with other important members of the movement in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. </para>
          <para>The Indian Ocean</para>
        <para>I had discussions on the Indian Ocean while I was abroad. Honourable senators will recall that I raised this matter in the United States and that the Government had raised it previously through diplomatic channels in both Washington and Moscow. I took the opportunity of my visit to Moscow to refer to this matter at the highest levels in the Kremlin. The Soviet Government understands our attitude. In the joint communique issued after my visit to Moscow the Soviet Government endorsed 'its readiness to participate' in 'seeking a favourable solution to the problem of making the Indian Ocean an area of peace'. I believe that in urging mutual restraint on the great powers we are on the correct course. To support any further development of bases in the Indian Ocean- or any long-term naval deployments in the area- is to support escalation and a heightening of tension in the region. We reject that course. </para>
          <para>Investment</para>
        <para>While in Western Europe, and especially in Bonn, I had full discussions on the question of investment in Australia. I made it plain that the Australian Government continues to welcome foreign investment but that we wish as far as possible to control our own industries and resources. I agreed that a West German mission should visit Australia in the near future to discuss in detail all aspects of investment in Australia. I agreed also to take up with the Australian taxation authorities the strongly expressed interest of the Belgium, Netherlands and Italian Governments in negotiating a double taxation agreement with Australia. </para>
          <para>The International Court</para>
        <para>Honourable senators should know that I took advantage of my visit to the Hague- the city in which the International Court of Justice is based- to refer to our warm support for the principles and objectives of the International Court and to urge that the international community give greater attention to the Court as an instrument for world peace and harmony. I urged that the Court's jurisdiction should be made compulsory and universal. Honourable senators will know that it has been the practice of most countries, including Australia, to accept the Court's jurisdiction only with reservations or with the exclusion of certain categories of dispute. I take this opportunity to inform the Senate that, as an earnest of our respect for the Court, Australia proposes to forgo her existing reservations and, in any dispute which we litigate before the Court, to accept its judgment unreservedly. </para>
        <para class="block">Relations with Britain </para>
        <para>In London I had useful and cordial talks with Prime Minister Wilson on important issues including energy problems, unemployment, inflation, the dangers of a world recession, British attitudes to the re-negotiation of the Treaty of Rome, and constitutional issues including the right of appeal to the Privy Council. At a later hour I shall be introducing Bills to give effect to the Government's policy on Privy Council appeals. That policy can be stated simply: we do not believe that Australians should litigate their disputes before the courts of another country. I believe that attitude is understood and accepted in Britain to a greater extent, regrettably, than it is in some quarters in Australia. </para>
        <para>In case there are any lingering misconceptions about the Government's approach to its relations with the United Kingdom, I made it clear in a speech at the Mansion House, which was widely publicised and applauded by the British media, that changes in the world situation had naturally led to changes in Australia's traditional relationship with Britain. I made it clear that those who saw the Government's recent actions concerning Britain as a manifestation of strident new nationalism or anti-British sentiment had completely misread the Government's intentions. What we are seeking to do is establish an independent Australian identity in the world and especially in our region. We have grown up. Our actions are in no way anti-British; they are simply pro-Australian. Contrary to a popular impression, I did not raise in Britain the question of State Agents-General. I made it clear that the traditional understanding and affection between Australia and Britain, based on strong historical and family connections, would deepen rather than diminish as Australia assumed her rightful place as an independent nation with a distinctive Australian role and a distinctive Australian voice in the South East Asian region, in the Commonwealth and in the world at large. We see particular value in our continuing associations with the Commonwealth. With the majority of member nations of the Commonwealth now lying in and around the Indian and South Pacific Oceans, Australia is geographically closer to the centre of the modern Commonwealth than is Britain herself. </para>
          <para>The Soviet Union</para>
        <para>It is 33 years since a former Labor Government established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. When I spent more than 6 hours in discussions with Chairman Kosygin and President Podgorny in the Kremlin it was the first time that Australia's views on a wide range of important issues had been put at this level. We discussed such matters as the situation in the North Asian region, Japan, China, Korea, detente and disarmament. </para>
        <para>I was also able to raise a number of human rights issues. While the Soviet Union maintains that these are matters within its domestic jurisdiction it is not insensitive to representations on these matters. I raised the matter of Jewish emigration. I raised the matter of 'Operation Reunion', that is, the scheme under which persons resident in the Soviet Union seek to join relatives or friends in Australia. Prime Minister Kosygin listened with courtesy to my presentation and replied in some detail on the question of Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union and on the question of 'Operation Reunion'. The Soviet Government takes the view that these are matters of purely domestic concern. Australia, for her part, believes that on any matters involving broad humanitarian rights, nations have a duty to put their viewpoints strongly. No purpose is served if we avoid issues where agreement is unlikely. The Soviet Union has a better understanding of our views and, I believe a greater respect for our candour. </para>
          <para>France</para>
        <para>In France I had substantial and lengthy discussions with President Giscard d 'Estaing and Prime Minister Chirac. I believe it is true to say that my visit and my reception by my hosts in Paris put the seal at the highest level on the resumption of normal relations with France following the strains which had developed over France's atmospheric testing in the Pacific. This testing has now ceased. </para>
        <para>Arising from my visit to Paris, it was agreed that  a  French trade mission should visit Australia in the coming months to explore the possibility of increasing commercial exchanges between our 2 countries. Businessmen in Australia should understand that there is no political constraint upon their initiating contacts with France. It was agreed also to negotiate a cultural agreement between Australia and France and an agreement on co-operation in science and technology, lt was further agreed to hold regular consultations between officials of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The first round of these consultations is likely to be held towards the middle of this year. </para>
          <para>Bangladesh</para>
        <para>My visit to Dacca brought into focus the issues involved in responding to Bangladesh's enormous needs, especially for food. I explained the great sympathy which the Australian Government and people felt for the people of Bangladesh in their struggle to feed their population. However, I felt obliged to point out to Sheik Mujib that while Australia is willing to do as much as we can for his country, it is not right that the whole burden for supply as aid, or selling on credit, of wheat for Bangladesh should fall on the relatively few countries which produce surplus grain. I suggested international arrangements under which some of the developed governments with capital, such as the Federal Republic of Germany or Japan, or the oil-rich Middle Eastern countries, might use some of their petrodollars to finance the purchase of wheat on credit from the grain producers. </para>
          <para>Detente</para>
        <para>I turn now to the broader issue of world peace. I see the peace of the world as resting on the progressive reinforcement of the network of accommodations and understandings between the 2 superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. This network of understandings is itself part of a wider balance of interests involving the other principal powers, China, Japan and the enlarged European Community. </para>
        <para>If peace is to be preserved- and in the ultimate analysis nothing is more important than that the interests of the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan and China and those of the enlarged European Community must be kept in balance in Europe and in Asia. Each must live with respect for the legitimate interests and aspirations of the others. Only in this way will detente become durable and global. Only in this way will peace be secured. </para>
        <para>It is the duty of the middle powers and the smaller powers to make their views heard in seeking to strengthen the structure of peace. This must be a common collective concern, not something left to the major powers alone. The future belongs to us all and, as I said in my address to the General Assembly last September, the Government rejects a concept of a world in which a handful of powerful men in charge of the most powerful nations chart the course for the rest of us to follow. </para>
        <para>Some may ask what influence a country like Australia has in the White House, in the Kremlin, in the Councils of Europe, in the Great Hall of the People, or in Tokyo? I believe we can and do have influence. I believe at the very least we should not fail to try to exert some influence for the causes in which we believe. We should not permit our views on major international problems like the proliferation of nuclear weapons and access to markets to go by default. </para>
        <para>I had a number of objectives in undertaking this journey and I believe I fulfilled them all. I wanted to emphasise Australia's continuing and substantial interest in Europe and to strengthen Europe's awareness of Australia. I have done so. I wanted to complete, as far as possible, the pattern of visits which my Foreign Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee)</inline> and I have been undertaking abroad to outline Australia's policies in a number of areas following the first change of government in 23 years. I have now largely completed that pattern of visits. I wanted to establish or strengthen personal contacts with the heads of government of important countries and exchange views with them on matters of international concern and on common economic problems including inflation and unemployment. I have done so. </para>
        <para>I wanted to discuss at first hand Australia's interest in long-term arrangements for the access of our commodities in markets in Europe and I have done so. It is less likely, I believe, that Australia will ever again be subjected to summary and restrictive closures of markets which we have carefully nurtured. I wanted to discuss at the highest level the international energy situation and to form my own assessments on the major policy issues involved in the sale of Australia's bountiful mineral resources, especially uranium and coal, to the countries of Europe. I have done so, and I believe the outlook for Australia in the area of energy supply is immensely encouraging. I wanted to discuss with those countries whose people have contributed to Australia's cultural heritage and economic development the present attitude of the Government towards immigration. This I did in Britain, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia and the Netherlands. I wished also to explain Australia 's policies on foreign investment and to remove any uncertainties about these policies: I have done so. </para>
        <para>Finally, I wanted to examine ways in which Australia might make its contribution to strengthening the fabric of co-operation between Australia and Europe and to explore, at the highest level, the attitudes of countries like the Soviet Union, France and Yugoslavia to detente and to the Middle East, which are essential to forming any sound assessment of the prospects for world peace. I have done so. </para>
        <para>I regret that many of these things, these immense and tangible benefits for Australia, have been obscured from the Australian people. I do not resent fair criticism from the media. Everyone in public life accepts such criticism, and frequently benefits from it. Even my worst enemies would concede that I have rarely complained about the media's treatment of me, that I have been more accessible to the media, more frank in my dealings with them, than any of my predecessors in this office. A free press has an essential and constructive role in democratic society. I regret, however, that on this occasion the Australian public was not served by the media as objectively or as intelligently as it deserves. Too often matters of substance were subordinated to reports of trivia. It was repeatedly suggested that much of my time was taken up with sightseeing, in visits to archaeological sites and museums. Very little time was taken up with these things and most of it was during public holidays and weekends. Such diversions are, of course, a normal part of the hospitality extended to visiting heads of government, and I make no apology for my interest in the culture and histories of the countries I visited. </para>
        <para>We are not a nation of Philistines; we should not be content with an image abroad based mainly on Barry McKenzie. I take some pride in the extensive and sympathetic presentation of my mission in the media in all the countries I visited. I found immense goodwill, not just for me, but for Australia. This goodwill was expressed and symbolised in many different ways. In Bangladesh, for example, there was a warm appreciation of Australia's food aid programs. In my visits to war cemeteries in France, in Belgium, in Crete, in Athens, I found deep and genuine gratitude for the contribution of Australian soldiers to the allied cause. In many countries there was a ready understanding of the links forged by our immigration program. Everywhere in the media of the countries I visited I found a full appreciation of the importance and urgency of the matters I sought to raise, I regret that I found so much less understanding in the media of my own country. </para>
        <para>Over a year ago, on my return from China and Japan, I had occasion to say that Australia had at last got her relations right with the 4 powers of most immediate concern to us- with Indonesia, our nearest neighbour; with Japan, our largest trading partner; with China, the most populous nation on earth; and with the United States, the world's most powerful nation and our finest ally. My visit to China ended a generation of lost contact with a quarter of the world's people. My visits to the United States, Japan, Indonesia and India consolidated, improved and matured existing relationships of great importance to us. My visit to the Soviet Union has marked a new stage in the development of practical and realistic relations with the other powerful nations on earth. My visit to Europe has reasserted our strong and continuing interest in the European Community, and, I believe, rekindled Europe's interest in a strong, progressive and independent Australia. Taken together, we have begun to fashion a more contemporary relationship with Europe East and West- more appropriate to the changed conditions of our time. We can now say confidently that Australia has got her relations right, not just with the countries nearest us, but with most nations of importance, and regions of importance, in the world. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Chairman,</inline>when consideration was interrupted we had just completed debate and a division on item 1. We are now dealing with item 2- Unread matter Incorporation in Hansard. The recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee in this regard is that the following sessional order should be endorsed by the Senate: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Where matter is incorporated in Hansard by leave of the Senate, it shall be on the understanding that the final decision as to the practicability of incorporating material such as graphs, maps, blocks, etc., and incorporating material of an improper nature or which is irrelevant, shall be made by the  President. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is intended that this proposal should operate initially as a sessional order. The Standing Orders Committee in discussing this matter considered the practice of senators seeking leave of the Senate to incorporate in Hansard certain material, such as tables with figures and extracts from documents, etc., which they do not read. From time to time this does or could cause printing difficulties and difficulties with Hansard. Therefore, for these reasons it is suggested that the sessional order to which I have referred should receive the endorsement of the Senate. It means that where matter is incorporated in Hansard by leave of the Senate, the ultimate decision as to whether it will go into Hansard shall be made by the  President.  Accordingly I move: </para>

The Standing Orders Committee considered the status and use of the list of speakers on the President's desk, and after some discussion it was agreed that the list was unofficial and it was no curb on the  President  whose duty and privilege it was to say which senator he considered had a prior right to speak. Nonetheless, the Committee considers that the list should remain, on the understanding that it is unofficial and must not be referred to in debate. </para>

          </quote><para class="block">Consideration was given to a proposal that the Senate should vote on the subject matter of an urgency motion rather than the question of rising until an unusual time. We all know the form of an urgency motion. It is 'that the Senate at its rising adjourn until 10.59 a.m. tomorrow for the purpose of discussing' a certain matter. If that motion is carried, the Senate, instead of meeting at 1 1 a.m. the next day, meets at 10.59 a.m. Consideration was given to the proposal that the Senate should vote on the subject matter of the urgency motion rather than the question of rising until an unusual time and, to that end, that the words in the standing order 'that the Senate at its rising adjourn to any day or hour other than that fixed for the next ordinary meeting of the Senate' should be left out. The effect, however, would be to accord precedence to a substantive motion of general business which would be contrary to the purpose of the standing order. Furthermore, there are established procedures for proposing substantive motions to the Senate. Nevertheless the Standing Orders Committee considers that the present pro dec ural motion, namely, 'that the Senate at its rising adjourn to any day or hour other than that fixed for the next ordinary meeting of the Senate', is antiquated and should be discarded. In its place the Committee recommends that debate take place upon a motion moved in the following form, and I ask honourable senators to take note of it because this is important: </para><quote>

          </quote><para class="block">After that the matter of urgency is specified. It is considered that this motion should not be open to amendment so as to prevent the introduction of substantive matter which should be the subject of a motion upon notice in the usual way. So far as notice is concerned, it is considered that the senator proposing an urgency motion should give notice to the  President  at least 90 minutes before the time fixed for the meeting of the Senate. Having regard to those 2 matters, the subject of this recommendation, it is recommended that existing standing order 64, which I have read, be amended as follows: </para><quote>
            <para>Paragraph (1), leave out 'The <inline font-weight="bold">Senator so</inline> moving must make in writing, and hand in to the  President  before the time fixed for the meeting of the Senate, a statement of the matter of urgency.', insert 'The <inline font-weight="bold">Senator so</inline> moving must make in writing, and hand in to the  President  at least 90 minutes before the time fixed for the meeting of the Senate, a statement of the matter of urgency. '. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">So far as the senator next speaking after the mover is concerned, it is provided in existing standing order 64 (2) that the mover and the Minister first speaking shall not exceed 30 minutes each. The Standing Orders Committee considered this matter and recommends that the mover and the senator next speaking shall not exceed 30 minutes. The proposal to leave out reference to the Minister is aimed at meeting a circumstance where, because of the nature of the subject matter of a particular urgency motion, it might be appropriate on occasion that a senator other than a Minister be allowed to follow the mover of the urgency motion. It is suggested that that senator other than a Minister should have the advantage of the extra time allowed. It is not implied by this change that there is any abdication of ministerial responsibility. It is well established that the subject of a motion of urgency must be a matter falling within ministerial responsibility and this basic rule remains. The position which would follow from the proposed amendment is that a Minister would retain the right to have the first call after the mover if he chose and he could speak for the same time as the mover, namely 30 minutes. If, however, by arrangement a senator other than a Minister were allowed and were given first call after the mover and spoke for 30 minutes in reply to the mover, then a Minister taking part in that debate would then speak for only the same time as other senators, namely 15 minutes. Bearing all those matters in mind the Standing Orders Committee recommended a proposed new standing order 64.

          </quote><para class="block">I am not clear in my mind and I would like some clarity on this matter. The Senate is a party House. Traditionally either a Minister or somebody in Government responds to such a motion. He should have 30 minutes. The mover plus his supporter should not have 30 minutes each. A Minister could be confined to 15 minutes. I would like that matter to be cleared up. In my mind, there is some ambiguity in that paragraph. </para><para>I wish to raise another question. I seem to recall a provision in the proposal that notice of the urgency motion should be given to the  President  at least 90 minutes before the time fixed for the meeting of the Senate. The  Clerk  or the previous  President  might be able to help me on this matter. I have in my mind the idea that a senator could give notice of an urgency motion for Tuesday, 90 minutes before the time fixed for the meeting of the Senate, and when he did that he could also give notice of urgency motions for Wednesday and Thursday. Therefore, a senator could have an urgency motion listed for each of the 3 sitting days of the week. He has made certain that he is the first one in, under the 90 minutes provision, but he may have pre-empted any other senator giving notice of an urgency motion because he has given notice of urgency motions for subsequent days. Since we are dealing with this matter of urgency motions I think now is the time for us to look at the matter and to see whether some amendment is necessary. On principle, I oppose the concept that that could happen. The  Clerk  might be able to advise the Minister that it cannot happen. The previous  President  might say that it cannot happen. I would like some clarity on that issue. A senator should not be able to pre-empt other senators because the first senator has given notice of a series of urgency motions, progressively, which would ensure that each sitting day of the week there was an urgency motion of which he was the mover. </para>

I favour the alteration of Standing Orders to prevent a mischief or to stop some abuse which has happened. My memory is not that good, but I remember one instance. An urgency motion normally is moved by a member of the Opposition and then the Minister in charge of the Department around which the question revolves replies. The following speakers have 1 5 minutes each. Although we are governed by practice and tradition as well as by the Standing Orders, the  President  always alternates the call, so there is no trouble. There was an occasion when the previous Government was in office when a Government backbencher moved an urgency motion. Honourable senators opposite will correct me if I am wrong. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> A Government backbencher moved an urgency motion. He was followed by an Opposition senator who had 30 minutes. At a later stage of the debate the Minister, who was not the mover or the senator who replied, had 30 minutes. On that occasion 2 speakers in support of the motion of urgency had half an hour each. </para>

              <para>-No. The next  speaker  was from the Opposition. He had half an hour. At a later period the Minister intervened. He was entitled to half an hour.

          <para>The other question relates to the giving of notice. I think there may be some confusion as to how the proposal seeks to solve the problem. Honourable senators will probably recall when the Democratic Labour Party had sufficient senators to move urgency motions. At the end of a session in December its members put on the notice paper half a dozen notices of matters of urgency which we discussed in March. They were urgent in December. We do not know whether they were urgent in March. Action of this sort holds the whole scheme up to some ridicule. The DLP did that for political propaganda, not to bring up a matter of urgency. I think we had some understanding that such notices could not be given more than 24 hours before the time fixed for the meeting of the Senate. This recommendation states that notice must be given at least 90 minutes before the time fixed. It still does not limit the ability of a senator to give notice 3 months before, which was the danger then. A senator cannot, as the DLP did, put 5 notices of motion on the notice paper because proposed standing order 64 (4) states: </para>

              <para>- I think that any alteration of the rules in that regard would be. I think the DLP at that time did itself more harm than good. I would not have sought to amend the rules to save the DLP senators. Someone wanted to get them out of the Parliament quicker than I did, apparently. They wanted to stop the suicide of their own Party. They are the reasons. I think it is reasonable to say that in the past the system was abused. Therefore, I think it is reasonable to accept the proposed alteration. </para>

            <para>- I thought I mentioned during the course of my remarks that the position which would obtain if the amendment were agreed to is that when a senator moved an urgency motion and spoke for 30 minutes the next  speaker  who would be a Minister, could exercise his right and speak for 30 minutes or allow another senator to exercise that right in lieu of his right. The second senator- the senator following the one who moved the motion- would speak for 30 minutes. In the event of the Minister's exercising his right to do that and choosing to speak later on in the debate, he could speak for only 1 5 minutes. </para>

          <para class="block">I think this would overcome what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson has brought to the attention of the Senate and would safeguard the government of the day, because it has always been the case that it is members of the Opposition who raise matters of urgency, not the Government. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir MAGNUS</inline>CORMACK (Victoria) ( 10.4)- I rise to my feet firstly to make a semi-pompous observation for which I hope honourable senators will forgive me. The situation amounts to this: However much we may draft constitutions or standing orders or involve ourselves in practice the facts of life of course are that constitutions are made for men and men are not made for constitutions. However carefully we may draft the Standing Orders of the Senate there always occurs a time subsequent to the amendments of the Senate when crafty or able men can find a way around them. So all we can do when we are dealing with Standing Orders is to realise that they are not cast in the mould of the tablets brought down from the mountain by Moses or the laws of the Medes and Persians, which were carved in perishable stone. The fact is that all we are trying to do is bring down Standing Orders that deal with matters as they arise, say, over a period of 20 years and try to avoid the pitfalls that crafty and ingenious men have found by which to evade them. </para>
          <para>The second observation I make- it is fairly important- is that there has grown up over the years a feeling that Ministers are a special caste; that they are bred like the Polynesian families who are kept in caves so they get a nice white skin, and when they come out not as dark and as ochre coloured as the commonalty of the people they are regarded as pretty important people and wherever they go there are taboos. I am willing to concede to Ministers of State a certain amount of priority and rights in the Senate.I am prepared to concede the rights of governments in the Senate. They should have priority in getting the business before the Senate; otherwise the Senate becomes totally unmanageable. </para>
          <para>On the question of time I think the case has been made out that there grew up a situation where the Minister backed off the urgency motion, allowed another senator to speak for 30 minutes- this has been made clear by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh-</inline> and then took another 30 minutes himself and deprived 4 senators who were supporting the urgency motion of the right of addressing themselves to the situation. That is the background, as it were. It was achieved, of course, by the advent of a corner party here in the Senate. </para>
          <para>Lastly I come to the problem of the 90 minutes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson said that he hoped some senator would address himself to the observation he made. I address myself to it by presenting a footnote on Senate history. One day when 1 was about to appear in the Senate to open the proceedings of the Senate and was waiting outside the door behind you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> through which you come so elegantly from time to time, watching that dreadful clock we have that goes 'tick, tock, tick'- you must not come in a second too early or a second too late precisely 45 seconds before I took the chair I had notice of an urgency motion delivered to my hands. Of course, the whole of the Senate was taken by surprise. Nevertheless, under the Stan ing Orders I had to accept that urgency motion. The Standing Orders Committee, examining all the relevance that relate to this matter, decided in the end that some formality had to be introduced into the system. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> I think the drafting is very good. I think it deals with a matter which in the course of time has been found to be imperfect, and 1 advocate that honourable senators should accept the redrafting as it stands. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSON (New South Wales) ( 10.8)- I want to be clear on this matter. What about the question I raised concerning post dating? The proposed new Standing Order contains the words 'at least 90 minutes'. What about when the notice is 2 days and 90 minutes or 5 days and 90 minutes? </para>

              <para>- I cannot recall its having occurred. The  Clerk  of the Senate tells me that it did occur on one occasion when a senator gave notice a week ahead. It has occurred only on the one occasion over the years. If that situation did occur may I suggest that, politics being what they are and honourable senators being what they are, it would bring about counter-activity. We would have some one else putting in a notice of motion or giving notice of an urgency motion. The situation would go on and would become utterly unworkable. We did consider these points. As I have said, we felt that this was a considerable improvement on the old standards. Therefore, on behalf of the Committee, I urge the adoption of the Committee's recommendations. </para>

            <para>- In spite of the cries of 'hear, hear' we are seeking to take away some right that an honourable senator now has. If other honourable senators are not concerned about that, I am. For the past 70 years during which the Senate has been in operation a senator has had the right, if he so requires, to speak for an hour and a half during an Address-in-Reply debate. This is the occasion on which an honourable senator either supports or opposes the operations of the Government as set out in the Speech of  His Excellency  the Governor-General or on the first reading of a money Bill when what he says may or may not be relevant to that Bill, An honourable senator may enter such a debate because he has a particular theory or particular policy he wants to advance. Can any honourable senator indicate an occasion during those 70 years when the time limit has been abused? </para>

              <para>- Yes, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack is much older than I am. During the 12 years I have been in this place it has never happened. No one has utilised an hour and a half but provision is there for someone to do so. If an honourable senator has an important item of national importance which he wants to develop it may take in excess of an hour to do so. Item 5 moved by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland)</inline> will mean that an honourable senator can speak for more than an hour only if he is granted an extension of time. Honourable senators have a right now to speak for an hour and half. In that time an honourable senator can present his views to the Senate in the proper way. An honourable senator may want to make a speech which will take more than an hour. In the past honourable senators who have gone beyond an hour have had the right to do so, but this motion seeks to stop senators from having that right in the future. This is something that has never been abused in the past. I cannot recall an occasion on which it has been abused. We have gone dangerously close to it. In fact,I never knew that an hour and a half was permissible. I may have spoken longer on previous occasions. </para>

              <para>-No, I did not take that long. When one is speaking on the air one used to be limited to half an hour but that is now limited to 20 minutes. If I wish to develop a matter why should I not have the right to do so? If I did on one occasion I had the right to do so. But now it is sought to take away that right from me. This motion is designed to cut down the rights of members. If extra time has been used in the past the time involved has been so insignificant as to be unimportant. This again is a taking away of something from members and leaving a House which is more restricted than the one we entered. That principle is wrong. </para>

            <para>-  I want to support the attitude that has been adopted by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh).</inline> By way of interjection some honourable senators referred to certain incidents that have taken place in this chamber over the years. Quite frankly I think that on at least one occasion that I can recall- perhaps on 2 occasions- I also have spoken for an excessively long time. A tendency has grown up during the time I have been in this place to whittle away the rights of honourable senators, particularly of back bench senators, and to whittle away their opportunity to explain in detail what may be a very involved case. We have seen time limits applied to urgency motions and to the time allowed to answers to questions on notice. Perhaps there are procedural matters where this is to the advantage of the Senate generally. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that we ought to retain an hour and a half for speeches because it would give to honourable senators on either side of the chamber an opportunity to speak at any time if they have a fairly heavy sort of matter they want to debate. Honourable senators are all aware that in the ordinary course of events in the last 10 years this has not happened more than 3 or 4 times at the outside. Prior to December 1972 it frequently took Ministers of the Government of the day up to half an hour to reply to a question without notice. They used to take the opportunity to deliver a second reading speech for propaganda purposes. I am not saying that the Ministers of the present Government are not without sin in this particular area, because some of them take a fairly long time to reply to questions. But then we want to look also at those who ask the questions. There are some honourable senators who come into this chamber with 3 pages of notes which are allegedly a question without notice. Those are the sorts of things that can be properly cut down, both from the ministerial side and from the back bench side. If there is a worthwhile debate or a debate about which an honourable senator feels particularly aggrieved and wants to put forward his case in detail, then that right ought to be in existence. He should be allowed to speak for an hour and a half. </para>

            <para>- During the debate relating to the Standing Orders I raised a question which I believe the Standing Orders Committee should examine to see whether some unanimity of thought can be reached on my proposal. I have been astounded to see in this chamber an honourable senator, after addressing himself to a matter and before resuming his place to give an honourable senator on the other side an opportunity to reply, moving that the question be now put. The  President, Chairman  or whoever may be occupying the Chair has no alternative but to put that question. I think that is entirely wrong and contrary to everything that I have known as a reasonable standard of debate. I therefore propose to move that the Standing Orders Committee be requested to examine standing order 281 which relates to the motion that the question be now put. I suggest that standing order 281 should read, in effect, that the motion that the question be now put may be moved only by an honourable senator who has not spoken on the question before the Chair.

My remarks are directed through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh)</inline> and to the Minister for Manufacturing Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> who in this chamber represents the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby).</inline> Earlier today I raised, by way of a question, the matter of an assault which allegedly took place by police on Aborigines at Laverton. Honourable senators will recall that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs undertook at that time to make further inquiries and, incidentally, also stated that he had been pressing rather heavily for an independent public inquiry into 3 other cases of alleged police brutality. They occurred at 2 places in the Northern Territory and at one place in Queensland. At Laverton, some 28 Aboriginals were involved. Among those who were allegedly battered in this confrontation were a number of women and children. </para>

        <para>Quite recently Tony As san who was a National Aboriginal Congress representative in the Mount Isa area made known to myself and to a number of other people in this Parliament an instance of alleged intimidation carried out by police in the Cloncurry area. I propose to refer to that in a few moments in greater detail. But the incident about which I want to explain some of the details relates to Finke River. It refers to the Spatula community at Finke River. I have obtained my information from 2 very reliable white community leaders, who are prepared to have their names attached to any document, together with 2 other white people and a number of Aborigines. The alleged attack took place in the Finke River area on ground which is the property of a local Aboriginal group. My informants tell me that this is the third instance in the last 4 years where white policemen have aggravated a situation which was not necessarily of the making of the Aborigines and which was certainly of only minor importance until such time as the white policemen interfered. </para>
        <para>On a previous occasion when an inquiry was called for a group of police in the Northern Territory inquired into the charges against the police. Consequently, they came up with a whitewash. This is not good enough. Nothing short of a royal commission or a Senate select committee or some other sort of public inquiry will overcome the problems of police and Aboriginal relationships. It is time we had such an inquiry because these incidents are getting far too common. Admittedly, in past years there were probably just as many but they were covered up. But today, with greater ease of communication, people are able more readily to communicate with those in authority in the community and we are hearing of a great many more incidents. I have been given permission to use my informants' names. At this stage I do not propose to do so. They are quite happy about having their names used publicly in any area in relation to this subject. I understand communications have been sent to the Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and also to the office of the Attorney-General. </para>
        <para>It is true that this incident may have been triggered off by some local railway workers who apparently referred to the local Aborigines as Black BV. This led to an exchange of words. I propose to name the policeman involved. It was Constable R. Henshaw. He could have been much more conciliatory in his handling of the situation but he adopted the rather provocative attitude of calling for reinforcements. A constable came from another centre, Kulgera, which is a tiny outpost in the Northern Territory. I propose to make a brief mention of another incident which took place at Kulgera. The constable threatened to shoot an Aboriginal. This is not the way one can resolve a minor incident. Naturally this led to retaliation as far as the Aborigines were concerned. I ask honourable senators to remember that all this was happening on the Aborigines own community ground where they ought to have had some protection and where they ought to have been able to defend themselves. It is alleged that some flagons were thrown. It is alleged that an Aboriginal went away and got some spears, none of which were used. The flagons were apparently thrown and a policeman suffered ° .mnor injury as a result. But in return an Aboriginal was seriously assaulted by the policeman. A number of people associated with the community endeavoured to create a spirit of harmony. </para>
        <para>The police, the Aboriginals and everyone concerned agreed that the matter would quieten down for the night, that everybody would go to bed and that next morning if there were charges to be laid the matter would be further discussed. But this did not satisfy the policeman. He moved on to the community property after everybody had settled down for the night and started blazing away with his revolver. There is some confusion as to the number of shots that were fired but there are people who are prepared to swear that at least two were fired and probably more. After making an agreement one would have thought that the keeper of the law in this area would have been the first person to honour that promise and not to go back and promote a further brawl on Aboriginal property. I believe the information that has been given to me because of the reliability of my informants. One of the persons concerned has worked in the area with Aboriginal people for 20 years. In a discussion today he said: 'It has gone far enough. We just cannot tolerate this any longer and I have to report it.' I have been further advised that 6 Aborigines have been charged with assault and that the case is to be heard on 7 March 1975. This will be another whitewash so far as the local police are concerned. I know that I should not refer in that way to a court of law. I regret very much that I have to say it, but there is a long history of this sort of thing happening in the Northern Territory, in Queensland and in some parts of Western Australia. </para>
        <para>In a previous instance another policeman was involved. He is now stationed at Yuendumu which is another Aboriginal settlement in the Northern Territory. Shortly after his arrival there- honourable senators should remember that he was associated with the previous incident at Finke River- a serious problem arose. I request the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to find out the full details behind this case and to make them public because I believe that unless these sorts of things are aired as widely as possible and publicly on all occasions, we will never overcome the serious defects in the relationship between the police and the Aboriginal people in the community. As a result of this policeman's call for help, extra police including 2 members of the Criminal Investigation Branch were taken in a few days ago. </para>
        <para>The Cloncurry incident also happened in 1975. A lot of things are happening in 1974 and 1975 that one would have expected to have happened at the turn of the century orin the last century. But they are happening in these days of so-called enlightened law enforcement. The National Aboriginal Congress representative in Cloncurry has told a number of people in writing over his own signature that the local police broke into a house, apparently without a warrant, woke people in their beds, took blankets off them and started interrogating them. Instances have been reported by the same man in the same area of young men who are in constant employment, who are good young workers, good people and respected employees being threatened by the police, who have gone out on to the jobs, with all sorts of actions if they do not admit to certain crimes that they have not committed. In one instance a policeman is alleged to have said: You have a white man's job working with the local railway department, and we will make sure you lose your job unless you submit and give us the information that we require'. He could not give the information. The only way in which that kind of thing will ever be sorted out is by making sure that there is a frank and open inquiry of the nature that I have suggested. </para>
        <para>I wish to refer for a couple of minutes more to an incident that occurred when a white man, accompanied by three or four Aborigines, tried to get served at the Kulgera Hotel. He has arranged for a statement that he has made to his solicitors to be forwarded to me. He states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>We pulled up outside the hotel. I went into the bar and ordered a beer and I asked the girl behind the counter if my friends could come in and have some tea and sandwiches. The reply was simply that ' You can, but they can 't. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">They could not go in because they were black. However, he was told that they could go to the back window and be served from there. So the Aborigines then had to go to the back to buy some soft drinks. The white man concerned, who was a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Leahy,</inline> bought some sandwiches. Then they drove down the road, stopped and had a conference about the incident. </para>
        <para>On Sunday 3 November they were driving back through Kulgera and a similar number of Aborigines were with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Leahy</inline> on this occasion. He pulled up to get some petrol and he asked for some tea, some chicken and some sandwiches so that they could eat them outside. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Burgess</inline> was the publican in that area. I was told today that he has now left the district; and a hell of a lot of black people and a hell of a lot of white people will be happy that he has gone. The hotel would not give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Leahy</inline> knives with which to cut up the chicken that he had bought so he used a small pocket knife which he carried. They ate the food outside, certainly on the hotel ground but not inside the hotel. The gentleman who owned the hotel drove down the road a few minutes afterwards, went into the hotel, apparently said nasty words to the girls who had served this man and his black friends and then he was heard to say to the girl: 'Why did you serve those bastards?' Sometimes that word is a word of affection in the Australian language but when it is used in that way it is a word of hate. He then came out and used the same word again to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline></para>
        <para class="block">Leahy and told him not to make a mess. The white man said to the hotelkeeper: 'Would you please play it quietly?' He was then assaulted by the publican for his trouble. He has now made a full statement to solicitors and I do not know what will happen to that case. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>through you I say to the 2 Ministers concerned with all sincerity that we want a full and fairly wide-scale public inquiry into these sorts of relationships. Maybe the answer is in the sort of thing that is happening in Townsville at the moment where teachers going to Aboriginal communities will have the benefit of perhaps a year's instruction on how to cope with the special problems in Aboriginal communities. Maybe this is what the police need. Maybe they need special training. I am not blaming particular policemen. The only system they know is, bash and ask afterwards. It is not good enough for the Australian community. </para>

          <para>- It is not often that I find myself on the same platform as my friend Jim Keeffe, but tonight I find that I must agree with him in his call for a royal commission into some of the allegations that have been made from time to time of police brutality and the discrimination that has been shown towards Aborigines in various parts of Australia. Unfortunately I cannot agree with him that it happens only in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. From my experience it is rather widespread. Perhaps I should confine my remarks at this stage to my experiences in my own State of Queensland. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> referred to an incident with which I was concerned in Cloncurry in Queensland and in regard to which I made some very widespread investigations. Unfortunately it is almost impossible to pinpoint or to substantiate the claims that are made by Aboriginal people. So often when a lone Aboriginal is walking down the street late at night- perhaps he has had a couple of beers or maybe on occasions has had one too many- he is accosted or allegedly arrested by 2 members of the police force. He is a lone Aboriginal. He is abused, mistreated and taken to the lockup. On being taken to the law court in the morning and appearing before a magistrate, it is his word against that of 2 members of the law enforcement organisation. What hope has a lone Aboriginal, who in the first place is black and in the second place is intoxicated, brought before a law court in the morning against 2 supposedly respectable enforcers of the law? He has not a hope in the world. I have seen the results of alleged police brutality on so many occasions that sometimes it makes my stomach turn. So I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> that there is a great need within the community for a royal commission into some of the allegations that are made against members of our law enforcement agencies. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I do not say that all members of the law enforcement agencies are this way inclined. There are very fine and respectable gentleman within the law enforcement agencies. I have a great admiration for those men who do their duty conscientiously and to the best of their ability. I have no quarrel whatsoever with them. But there are always the ones who sometimes allow their power to go to their heads and when they are dealing with some unfortunate Aboriginal or group of Aborigines they do tend to use brutality that they would not use in other circumstances. I would be the last to deny that there are some naughty Aborigines, but there are non Aborigines who can be just as naughty. I believe that a royal commission of some kind would bring to light not only the atrocities which are being perpetrated against Aborigines and of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has spoken but also the fact that there are occasions when members of law enforcement agencies need to chastise and bring to justice Aborigines who are not doing the right thing. So a royal commission certainly would be in the best interests of all Australians. </para>
        <para>I know that this kind of thing happens to other members of the community as well as Aborigines. I know of many occasions when non Aboriginal people also have run foul of those people within the law enforcement agencies who have no scruples and no sense of decency whatsoever. So, while this matter is being looked at in regard to the Aboriginal people, perhaps it could be looked at also in regard to other underprivileged people within our community. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has raised the matter tonight in relation to the Aboriginal people. I support what he is asking for- a royal commission. I am not quite sure how this c-.i be brought about. But surely those in authority, such as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Attorney-General, can look at this matter and do something about it. It is high time that something was done about it because certainly far too much of this type of thing is going on. </para>
        <para>I do not pick on Queensland in particular because I know that this is happening in other States. But since I represent Queensland, since most of my time is devoted to Queensland and since I spend a lot of my time travelling around that State, I find that a lot of this is happening in that State. I am conscious of it happening in other States. For instance, it happens at Redfern and other places in Sydney. I have heard of police brutality and victimisation of Aborigines in that area. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has raised a case of it happening in Western Australia. I have had it brought to my attention that such things have happened in Victoria and in South Australia. So surely a royal commission in this area would serve the purpose of making us all satisfied that justice not only will seem to be carried out but also will be carried out because those who are responsible for the enforcement of the law will know that if they are not administering justice as they should there is a likelihood of someone bringing them to book. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, it is strange that this evening I find myself on the same platform as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline></para>

          <para>- I do not think that anyone needs to apologise for being on the same platform as a political opponent when the cause is considered by both to be just. Accepting at face value that both honourable senators who have spoken on this question are desirous of doing something about rectifying what is claimed to be police brutality, I think that we should all join with them and say that we are united on this question. I think that it is generally accepted today that it is not only Aborigines but also members of the low socioeconomic community who are being arrested for crimes. Members of this section of the community who offend against the laws of Australia get a rough time from the police. 1 think that from time to time in the areas where the members of the Aboriginal community are regarded as far inferior by the white section of the community, the police somewhat reflect the general attitude of the community that the Aborigines should not receive the normal just treatment. No one has been more aware of this than me in my portfolio. No one has tried to do more to obviate it and to see whether we can prevent it. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>When I took over this portfolio my predecessor, the present Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant),</inline> had an ex-policeman <inline font-style="italic">from</inline> Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Shilton,</inline> travelling Australia to make a report on police brutality. When his report was given to me I found that it showed he had interviewed only Aboriginal people who had made allegations against the police; but the police refused to see him to contradict the statements and he could just repeat what Aborigines had said about how they were brutally assaulted by the police on various occasions. I did not even release the report for publication because I thought that in view of the negotiations in which </para>
        <para class="block">I was involved at the time it would do more harm than good in bringing about a better relationship with the police. It contained just a series of accusations, and the police had the right to make alternative charges or statements but they refused. When we receive a report of police brutality I never receive a report which is not investigated and it goes to the State concerned for investigation, invariably the report of the police, supported by the fact that the defendant was convicted in the court, is that there was no foundation for the allegations that were made to me. Despite all that, we know that unnecessary rough treatment is taking place. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline>has raised 3 issues. This is what I know about the Finke River incident. I was telephoned by Miss McGrath from the Legal Aid Office in Katherine last Friday. She told me that what took place could be reported as a near riot.  Her  version of the incident, having interviewed the Aborigines in the court at Alice Springs, was that a member of the train crew abused the Aborigines and one Aboriginal of the tribe took exception to it and a fight ensued. The police were called and there was a serious bashing up of the Aboriginal people. She asked me to send George Abdullah from my Department to investigate it because she thought he had some method of conveying information to or getting the confidence of the Aboriginal people. We were not in the position that he could be spared from the Central Office. We sent <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bobby</inline> Liddle who is employed by us at Alice Springs and who is a part Aboriginal. We thought that he would have a good rapport with the Aborigines for investigation into this matter and report to me and to the Legal Aid Service at Alice Springs. The Legal Aid Service at Alice Springs is handling the case before the court. </para>
        <para>I read in the newspapers this morning of the arrests that have occurred at Yuendumu. The European police were asked to go to Yuendumu by the tribesmen of the settlement because there had been some trouble and some fighting and the nurses had left the settlement. When the police arrived I believe a fight occurred between them and the Aborigines. It was only then that I found that the sergeant who was sent to Yuendumu had been taken off another settlement because of bad treatment of Aborigines. He had been brought into Alice Springs because it was thought he could be kept under better surveillance. The natural hatred of Aborigines by the policeman caused an upsurge of violence on his arrival. I wrote to the then Attorney-General asking whether he could make some other arrangements and get a more suitable policeman. </para>
        <para class="block">A lot is achieved if policemen can talk to and cooperate with Aborigines. </para>
        <para>As I said this morning, the situation at Laverton is not the most serious in Western Australia. When I was there Europeans claimed that they walked into a police station and saw a sergeant of police bashing up an Aboriginal in order to obtain from him an assurance that he would plead guilty to a charge the next morning.I have heard of policemen saying to their girl friends this is not the evidence of Aborigines- 'I am going out to get a few more boongs'. That is an indication of what is happening in Western Australia and it has been conveyed to the Acting Premier of Western Australia. The Premier of Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court, telexed a letter to me today. He asked me to wait for Magistrate Small 's report. The Premier appointed the magistrate to make a report on the matter because of his sympathy to Aborigines and his record in Aboriginal affairs. The letter states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>After reading your 7 February letter, I am still of the opinion that we should await Magistrate Sydall's report as he is a person who is highly regarded in the State because of his experience with, knowledge of, and sympathy for the Aboriginal people. </para>
          <para>Unfortunately, he was admitted to hospital yesterday but I am assured he will be discharged fairly soon and should have his report ready for Cabinet next Tuesday. </para>
          <para>I am also hopeful I might have a chance to see you for a few minutes whilst I am at the Premiers' Conference on Friday. </para>

        <para class="block">The letter then refers to the possibility of the exaggeration of a person who feels aggrieved. The letter continues: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>All the reports I am receiving from the Laverton area are that the responsible elements within the Aboriginal community believe that a full scale royal commission will not be in the best interests of the Aboriginals or the Laverton and Warburton areas. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Doubts have been expressed by Aborigines that the fear of going before a royal commission may prevent the obtaining of the truth. </para>
        <para>When I became Minister for Aboriginal Affairs police from No. 21 Division in Sydney were going into Redfern and bashing up the Aborigines. I approached <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maddison,</inline> the then Minister of Justice in New South Wales, with the proposal that we should have a conference between the police and the Aboriginal community. The conference was arranged with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maddison</inline> 's support and the arrest rate at the Empress Hotel at Redfern dropped 73 per cent. </para>
        <para class="block">The publican praised the reduction in the damage such as broken glasses, bottles and windows that had been occurring at this hotel. Damage was practically eliminated. This appears to be the solution. I have approached Ministers in other States.I have approached <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitrod,</inline> the Commissioner of Police in Queensland, who said: 'Well, they can call in and see our sergeant at any time. He will listen to them'. There is no formal arrangement. I have approached the South Australian Minister with the view to holding a similar conference there. The conference cannot be held because of charges pending as a result of a dispute at the Royal Exchange Hotel at Port Adelaide. The dispute happened 6 months ago and the charges have not yet been heard. </para>

            <para>- We wanted to have a discussion and see whether we could get a better relationship. The Attorney-General of South Australia thought it would be inappropriate to have a discussion on this and other incidents while there were related matters before the court. Those matters are still being dealt with. We find that there is not a general interest to try to do something in this area. We can do nothing because Aborigines are refused tea and sandwiches in Queensland. We have no racial discrimination Bill. We made an attempt to clean up Queensland last session. The Senate rejected the Bill which would have enabled us to do so. The Senate will not give us the armament for the purpose of going in and doing things for the Aborigines.

          <para>Has the Leader of the Government in the Senate seen a message from the International Secretariat of Amnesty International advising of finding the tortured body of Lumi Vide la Moya dumped on the premises of the Italian Embassy in Santiago, a report confirmed by the Italian Foreign Office in Rome? Does the message also allege that the husband and 4 year old son of the dead woman were also tortured in her presence? In view of the serious allegation and the extension of torture to young children, will the Leader of the Government raise this inhuman and fiendish development with the Prime Minister and ask him to protest on behalf of the Australian Government to GeneralPinochet against the torture and murder of political prisoners in Chile? In particular, will the Attorney-General ask the Prime Minister to seek the release of Sergio Alfredo Perez and his 4 year old son and offer them asylum in Australia? </para>

        <quote>
          <para>I have not seen the message to which the honourable senator refers. Our Embassy in Santiago has reported that an official enquiry is to be conducted into the death of Lumi Vide la Moya. The Embassy has received no information confirming the alleged torture of Sra Moya's 4 year old son. The Australian Embassy in Chile has been instructed to report the results of the enquiry to the Department of Foreign Affairs as soon as it is completed. The Embassy will continue to take all appropriate opportunities to condemn the continuing disregard for human rights in Chile and to urge the Chilean authorities to release their political prisoners. </para>

            <para>- The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:  ( 1 ), (2) and (3). It is established procedure that all bookings for overseas air travel at Australian Government expense are made direct with Qantas or one of its General Sales Agents. If Qantas cannot make space available on one of its own or its partners' flights on the date travel is desired and it is not feasible to alter the date Qantas will arrange u booking through another carrier. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Because of this administrative arrangement, warrants are placed on Qantas or its General Sales Agents rather than a particular airline, e.g. Ethiopian Airways. The extraction of information to indicate which bookings were made at Government expense for travel on Ethiopian Airways would be, I am advised, a lengthy and costly exercise involving the examination of many thousands of documents and is not considered to be warranted. </para>

            <para>- On 19 November 1974, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> asked me the following question, without notice: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The Minister will be aware of the departmental policy requiring all future installations of ships' radios to be of the single side band type. I ask: Is he aware that the single side band radio is twice the cost of the type of radio currently in use, in other words, about $1,200 as compared with $500 or $600? Is he also aware that there is no need whatsoever to require single side band sets to be installed in those vessels commonly referred to as small ships, that is, yachts, pleasure craft and vessels of that kind? In view of the discouragement to install radios because of the very great cost involved in single side band sets does the Minister appreciate the reduction in the safety aspect of small ship usage? Will he seek a review of the situation? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The following is the answer the honourable senator's question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The change in the transmission mode to single side band is being introduced on a world wide basis by international agreement as a means of relieving serious congestion in the high frequency radio spectrum so that services may continue to operate without harmful interference. </para>
            <para>The plans for the change in the method of operation in the maritime service, which were announced in May 1972, provide that no new or replacement double side band equipment may be installed at any coast station or in any ship station for normal communication purposes after 1 January 1974. However, the plans also provide that ship stations licensed before 1 January 1974, which operate on frequencies above 4 MHz are not required to change to single side band until 1 January 1978, and these which operate only on frequencies below 4 MHz, until 1 January 1982. Yachts and pleasure craft mainly fall in the latter category. </para>
            <para>It is true, as I indicated previously, that the new single side band equipment is more expensive than double side band equipment. Nevertheless, it is not considered desirable to grant exemptions from the requirement on this account. There is no need for the safety of small vessels, such as yachts and pleasure craft, to be in jeopardy, however, as provision exists for their owners to install double side band equipment fitted for operation on 2182 kHz, which is the international distress and calling frequency and on which all official coastal radio stations keep a continuous listening watch. Owners of small vessels may also belong to one of the many clubs which operate around the Australian coast and participate in the safety harbour mobile communication services which are normally provided. </para>
            <para>Furthermore, my Department's policy now provides for the establishment and operation of very high frequency maritime radiotelephone services in Australia which will be designed to cater for the communication needs of small vessels operating in coastal waters and it is hoped to announce details of the new types of these services shortly. </para>

            <para>- On 1 1 December 1974 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> asked me a question, without notice, about bonded teachers. I have been advised by my colleague the Minister for Education that assistance under the Tertiary Education System Scheme, including the special concession to two and three year trained teachers wishing to obtain degrees is not available to students who are bonded or party to a training agreement with an employer. This is long standing practice and ensures that government assistance is applied to the students' choice of course rather than to the training of personnel for a particular company or industry. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Where a student is under a bond he can become eligible for assistance by discharging his obligations under that arrangement. </para>
          <para>No special arrangements have been made by us to extend the concession to bonded teachers employed by State Departments of Education. </para>
          <para class="block">The concession is aimed mainly at mature teachers who on the basis of their experience feel the need for improvement in qualifications. It is expected that a large number of those seeking assistance under the concession will have already discharged their obligations through years of service. It should be remembered however that in most States the Education Departments themselves have in-service courses and grant study leave to enable teachers to undertake further study. The special concession under our scheme should be seen as complementing existing arrangements enabling teachers to upgrade qualifications. </para>

            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The valuation was made by the official Australian Government valuers from the Australian Taxation Office. The valuation was $400,000 but the valuer indicated that a price of $425,000 was reasonable. In this context I should indicate that the asking price for the Trades Hall building was $475,000. In answering this question the Minister has reminded me of statements made in Hobart that the price was $270,000 more than the latest Government valuation and $170,000 more than what experienced valuers gave as a fair and reasonable price. The valuations made by the Australian Taxation officers have been accepted from time immemorial by Governments of all political persuasions in Australia and they have been endorsed from time to time in the highest Courts of the land. The State Valuer-General's valuation of course, is made from time to time, usually at intervals of five years and is for limited purposes of rating, land taxes, and other State purposes. It would certainly not be taken as an accurate assessment of market value. In this particular case the Valuer-General's valuation was made quite some time prior to the date of purchase. For that reason alone, quite apart from the fact that it is a valuation for rating purposes, it would not be an indication of market value at the time of purchase. The valuation advice on which the purchase was negotiated can be amply supported. To suggest otherwise is a reflection on the integrity of highly skilled and unbiased public servants. </para>
