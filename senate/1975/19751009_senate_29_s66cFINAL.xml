            <para>-The Government is aware that tension in the border areas is high and regrets the deterioration of the situation there. The Indonesian Government has denied yesterday&#39;s reports alleging involvement by its forces in action in East Timor. It is possible that they refer to the recapture by UDT forces of Batugade a day or two ago. The town, which is very close to the Indonesian border, has been fought over by Fretilin and UDT several times over the past few weeks. There has therefore been a good deal of military action around it. The reports of Indonesian involvement, of course, come from Fretilin sources. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Australian Government is unable to confirm or deny reports that any Indonesian forces might have been engaged in the fighting. Nor is the Government able to comment on Press reports that UDT and Apodeti forces in the border areas have been provided with arms and other supplies. What the Government can confirm is that Indonesia has a large scale refugee problem on her hands, with some 40 000 people having fled across the border into Indonesia. These figures have been confirmed by the International Committee of the Red Cross which also reports that a high proportion of the refugees are women and children. </para>
          <para>These developments bear out the Government&#39;s long and firmly held view that the best means of resolving the problems posed by the decolonisation of Timor is by talks between the political parties in the colony. I would urge all parties to put behind them the acrimony that has developed over the past few months and to join the Government of Portugal in talks aimed at reaching a solution that would permit the restoration of peace and order and a revival of the process of peaceful decolonisation. The Government has stated previously, and I repeat, that this process should go forward free of external interference. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Postmaster-General. It relates to the quarterly billing of telephone accounts, a system which is already operating in Sydney and Melbourne. Can the Postmaster-General inform the Senate when it is expected that the service will be extended to other States? What benefits does the system offer to subscribers? </para>

            <para>-The quarterly billing of telephone subscribers was introduced on a limited basis in Sydney and Melbourne from 1 July. The bills will be issued quarterly to telephone subscribers whose telephones have been connected from that date. On present planning, a similar service will be provided in other capital cities and some larger provincial centres in the next 3 years. In South Australia it will be provided towards the middle or the end of 1976. Subscribers in Sydney and Melbourne under this system will receive their first accounts in November. As yet we are not in a position to say how customers will react to the system. However, it is expected that quarterly billing will ease the financial burden on subscribers, who will be better able to control and monitor the use of their services. </para>

I think the witness who was brought before the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis,</inline> made that point very clearly. This assurance has been re-stated on many occasions and the Opposition has been challenged on many occasions to produce evidence to the contrary. The Opposition has never been able to produce it because it does not exist. </para>

            <para>-The question of the sovereignty over territory around the port of Trieste has been a cause of dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia, as most people know, for more than 30 years. The 1947 Peace Treaty provided for a free territory of Trieste and denned the border between Yugoslavia and Italy. Neither side ever accepted this arrangement. Until 1954 the sector to the west of Trieste remained under provisional Anglo-American administration, while the sector in the east was under Yugoslav military administration. The London Memorandum of 1954 provided for the zone under Anglo-American administration to pass to Italian civil administration, and the Yugoslav zone to Yugoslav civil administration. This situation existed until the present time, with continual wrangles between Italy and Yugoslavia over the demarcation line. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In statements to the Italian Senate and Chamber of Deputies on 1 October of this year Prime Minister Moro and Foreign Minister Rumor confirmed that agreement had been reached with Yugoslavia on the Trieste question. The Italian Foreign Minister has stated that the agreements would define the border, regularise the juridical status of citizens in the area, protect the rights of families who wished to move from one area to another, guarantee the rights of ethnic minorities in the border areas, assure Trieste of possibilities for development and encourage co-operation in a wide range of sectors between Yugoslavia and Italy. The Yugoslav Foreign Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Milos</inline> Minich, presented the agreements to the Yugoslav Parliament on 1 October, and the Parliament has accepted them. The Italian Parliament is expected to accept the agreements shortly. The agreement will formalise provisions of the London Agreement which have been in force since 1954. Italy will therefore have sovereignty over Zone A west of the port and Yugoslavia over Zone B east of the port. The maritime border in the Gulf of Trieste will be redrawn so that Italy has adequate channels for passage of large ships and is guaranteed passage through Italian territorial waters, thus terminating the present necessity of crossing exclusively Yugoslav territorial waters. The agreement confirms the Italian status of Trieste and the town of Gorizia. The Australian Government welcomes the agreements on Trieste. They will remove a possible source of irritation between 2 states with which Australia has friendly relations. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to an interview on the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio program <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> this morning in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gaskill,</inline> an Australian financier in London, was questioned on the overseas loans affair. I refer also to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gaskill&#39;s</inline> statement that he had been recently in contact with Commonwealth Treasury officials and had been informed by the Treasury that the Commonwealth Government is currently interested in raising substantial overseas loans on appropriate terms. Since the Treasurer, in reply to a recent question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> on the Loan Bill, stated that the Government would not raise overseas loans of any dimensions this year, I ask: Will the Minister reaffirm without qualification the answer by the Commonwealth Treasurer which the Minister tabled in the Senate? Will he confirm that neither the Treasury nor any Minister has any authority to indicate the current interest of the Government in any substantial overseas loan borrowings? </para>

            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> well knows, the Australian Government requires loan moneys to be raised at various times for various purposes. There is a deliberate attempt to confuse the normal loan raising functions of the Australian Government with the matters which have been the subject of debate in this chamber and which are commonly known as the &#39;Loans affair&#39;. The question arises from the alleged involvement in or encouragement of efforts to raise money overseas in $1 billion units, which was referred to by either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> in this chamber last week. This is a total confusion and, I think, a deliberate attempt to confuse. The fact is that the Government is entitled to seek loan moneys on the overseas market in the normal way, and the Treasurer has made it quite clear that any further raisings of loan moneys overseas will be done only with his authority. They will be done, I would think, in the normal manner. That is a statement which I am sure the Treasurer would stand by. It will be the procedure. The Australian Government is entitled to seek moneys on the overseas loan market, and it is not a proper course at all that the issue should be clouded by newspaper reports, which cannot be substantiated, about very large sums involving $ 1 billion units. </para>

              <para>-I think that it is. I do not have the set of documents with me, but I am pretty sure that it was the first or second answer given on a previous occasion. The question referred to the possible raising of overseas loans for the purpose of deficit funding. In that answer there was reference to the possibility of the raising of a $50m loan for AIDC purposes. On behalf of the Treasurer, I certainly reaffirm the answer that was given to that question. </para>

            <para>-No, I do not consider them anything like accurate reports of the answer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> asked yesterday whether investigations had been undertaken by the Department of Social Security into recipients of unemployment benefits and whether it had been found as a result of these inquiries that some 30 per cent of those into whom the inquiries were made were not eligible for these benefits. The answer which I gave was yes, this was so, but I pointed out during the course of my answer, as Hansard will reveal, that the inquiries were made in selected areas where it was anticipated that a fairly high number of people who were not entitled to the benefits were receiving them; that in no way did this represent a national average and that in fact a number of the people were not dole cheats but were people who had not had their names removed from the list of recipients of unemployment benefits either because they had changed their addresses or they had obtained employment but had not, through inadvertence or otherwise, notified the Department of Social Security. </para>

          <para class="block">No such statement was made by me, nor could any such conclusion be drawn from anything that I have said. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> said that on the basis of 30 per cent of those people about whom inquiries were made being ineligible, some 100 000 of nearly 300 000 people receiving benefits would be cheating the system. As it happens there are not 300 000 people receiving unemployment benefits. Those are the unemployment statistics of the Department of Labor and Immigration. The number receiving unemployment benefits is less than 200 000. So in any event the figures were wrong. </para>
          <para>On top of that it was not suggested, as I made quite clear in my answer, that 30 per cent of total recipients of unemployment benefits were dole cheats. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> with some remarkable arithmetic, said that the Government is resolved to crack down on dole cheats to end the scandal costing the country $7.8m a week. No such proposition was put forward and no such answer was given by me. I think this is an example of either gross incompetence by the Murdoch Press or a deliberate attempt to mislead the Australian people. </para>

            <para>- Of the original appropriation of $20m to be lent through the Commonwealth Development Bank to beef producers, $15m has been allocated. Of course those loans have been made at normal commercial rates of interest. In the case of the joint arrangement between the Australian Government and the State governments- I refer to the 4 per cent loan money- of the total of $40m an amount of $15m has been allocated although not all that $15m has been paid out. I might just indicate in passing that the very fact that three-quarters of the original $20 m has been taken up by beef producers at normal commercial rates of interest through the Commonwealth Development Bank indicates that a great many of those producers were quite able to pay the commercial rates after an assessment of their viability by the Commonwealth Development Bank. </para>

            <para>-Senator Greenwood would know full well that questions relating to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation normally are not answered. However the one concerning ministerial responsibility is one which may be answered. I might add that by implication, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is denigrating the new Director-General of Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward whom I understood was acceptable to the Opposition as a suitable person for that particular position. It has been the practice all down the years, whether under this Government or other governments, for the Prime Minister to have a special relationship with Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. All Prime Ministers have had this relationship. Why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> should see something sinister in the ministerial responsibility being that directly of the Prime Minister, I am at a loss to understand. Those changes have been made in accordance with the relationship that would normally exist between the Prime Minister and Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. </para>

            <para>-I am informed that the tests conducted on the system have been very successful so far. The system is a microwave landing system that is aimed at prolonging the life of some airports by permitting greater movement rates without increasing noise pollution or adding any safety hazard. It provides accurate guidance over wide sectors in the approach and take-off regions, permitting curved and segmented flight paths for both landing and take-off. This helps with noise abatement as well as catering for the new type of short take-off and landing aircraft. The equipment is meeting its design specifications, as developed by the 2 bodies mentioned, and the level of accuracy required by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which originally requested its members to develop such systems. The tests are continuing. In fact, the current series will be completed at the end of the year. I am informed that further tests will go on next year and that they are expected to be completed by the end of 1976. I think that the contributions that have been made by the 2 departments are very praiseworthy. </para>

            <para>- I have seen the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamer</inline> &#39;s statement. It is, I suppose, not surprising that we are seeing an increasing number of similar opinions being expressed lately in view of the rapidly increasing burden which is being imposed upon both private and government employers because of the rapidly increasing premium rates for workers compensation insurance. Similarly, if I may add, one sees in conjunction with this an almost equally rapid increase in the premiums for compulsory motor vehicle third party insurance, which is also causing a great deal of concern. There were discussions between myself and the relevant responsible Ministers from all 6 Australian States earlier this year. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rossister</inline> from Victoria represented that State at the meeting. There was an amiable and quite free exchange of views on the whole question of national compensation at that meeting. At the time I undertook that we would have further discussions. Of course, the position is in a state of some fluidity at the present time as a result of the Senate Committee&#39;s report and as a result of further deliberations which are taking place in the Government as to what future action we shall take on the question of national compensation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that this is a matter in which we should be moving co-operatively with the States. I will take up <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett&#39;s</inline> suggestion that I write to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamer</inline> about this matter. I would be very happy to have further discussions with him on the question. Certainly, the matters to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamer</inline> and the Leader of the National Country Party in Victoria have referred are matters which are the subject of the Woodhouse-Meares report, they were dealt with by the National Compensation Bill which is still on the notice paper in the Senate and was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. I believe that they should be covered by a national scheme because the problems are problems which affect all the States equally. However, I shall write to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamer.</inline> I hope to have further talks with him or his responsible Minister on whatever proposals he wishes to put forward. </para>

            <para>-I feel that I have answered the question two or three times in the last couple of weeks. I can only say again that the Industries Assistance Commission reports have to be considered by the Government. There is a proper procedure which has to be observed. The report was presented only this week. As I indicated in answer to a question asked yesterday, it will probably take about 3 weeks before a recommendation is placed before the Cabinet. I cannot add any more than that. </para>

The anticipated overseas borrowing activities of the Government are for small refinancing loans to cover maturing debt and for a borrowing of about $50m for onlending to the AIDC. In addition, there are expected to be small net borrowings on behalf of the Australian National Airlines Commission and Qantas Airways Limited. These were also mentioned in the answers provided on 2 September by the Acting Treasurer- under the section dealing with net drawings under credit arrangements. </para>

            <para>-That is a difficult question to answer because so many very generalised undertakings have been given by the Opposition in these reports over the last few weeks that they would amount to very large sums of money. For example, if one were to total up the commitments for superphosphate, the beef industry and income stabilisation, they would probably amount to some hundreds of millions of dollars. It is quite obvious that it is a contradiction for the Opposition spokesmen on these matters to try to suggest that under those arrangements the deficit would be held at the level at which it is being held by this Government. It is impossible to have it both ways, and I think it is time the Opposition put all these so-called promises together. Let us add them all up- the increased expenditure on defence arrangements and federalism and the implementation of the Mathews Committee report on company tax and personal tax. Let us have them all put together in one coherent picture to see what they would add to the Budget deficit. We would probably see an increase of the order of $2,000m on the present deficit. </para>

            <para>- I address my question to the Postmaster-General in his capacity as the representative of the Minister for Environment. The South Australian Murray Irrigators Association has expressed its concern at the presence of the smothering aquatic weed, water hyacinth, in the Murray-Darling river system and the threat it presents to the Murray. Is it a fact that there are some 22 000 acres of water hyacinth in the MurrayDarling system which are not under control and that it is possible for a single plant to spread and cover 700 square yards of river surface in 12 months? Has an aerial and ground spray control program costing $50,000 been arranged between the Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments? If so, why has the work not yet been carried out? Is it a fact that at present the weed is being held back by a stabilising log raft near Moree but that any major flood could divert the river and infest the Murray for all time? Will urgent consideration be given to having the control program implemented? In view of the urgency of this question, I indicated earlier to the Minister my intention of asking it. I hope he has some information on this matter. </para>

          <para>- I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether he is aware that research into the cost of question time over a sessional period in the British House of Commons indicated that the cost for the session so far as the taxpaper is concerned was close to ? Stg500,000? Is the Minister aware that many of the questions placed on the Senate notice paper by members of the Opposition are of a frivolous nature and that in most cases answers can be readily obtained through alternative information sources? Can the Minister inform the Parliament whether there is a likelihood that the Opposition is indulging in a campaign to hamper research officers in various departments in the execution of their normal duties? Can he give an estimate of the cost to the taxpayer of supplying answers to the many frivolous questions asked by the Opposition? </para>

          <para>-I think many of the questions asked without notice by the Opposition are frivolous, quite apart from those questions that are asked on notice. It is the accepted procedure in the Parliament that every member has the right to seek information by whatever method he chooses. It may be that alternative methods of finding the information being sought could and should be used, such as the method suggested by the honourable senator. There may be economies in doing it that way. I would think that it is a matter of judgment for all members of the </para>

I refer to an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily News</inline> on 7 October, a copy of which I sent the Minister yesterday. It relates to the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby.</inline> I ask the Minister: What is the present status of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby?</inline> Does he have a binding 7-year agreement for employment? Will the Racial Discrimination Act be proclaimed this month, as the article suggests, since presumably an appointment under the Act would require the Act to be proclaimed?

          <para class="block">Grassby was appointed Commissioner-designate under section 2 (3) of the Act. As the honourable senator will be aware, sections 1, 2 and 7 of the Racial Discrimination Act have already come into operation but the rest of the Act has not yet come into force. It is related to another matter which is part of the honourable senator&#39;s question, that is, the date of coming into force in Australia of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. I understand that the Prime Minister intends to make an announcement about this matter on 24 October, United Nations Day, and although at present I enjoy the favour of the Prime Minister I would not like to put that standing at risk by pre-empting his announcement. The honourable senator will not have to wait very long for an answer. </para>

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is similar to that asked earlier this morning by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt.</inline> It refers to Press reports that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jose</inline> Ramos Horta, Foreign Affairs Secretary of the ruling Revolutionary Front for Independent East Timor- Fretilin- has claimed that there has been an invasion by Indonesian troops. Will the Minister press his Government to act in a more positive way by sending a team of observers to East Timor to assess the true situation in that country for the sake of those innocent people who must be suffering while this turmoil continues? </para>

Now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> asks that we send a specific team to examine what the situation is. I do not think there is any doubt that there are disturbances on the borders, as I have mentioned already. As to sending up a team, I do not quite know whether the honourable senator means it should be a Government team or whether it should include outsiders. As I said in answer to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> recently on this matter, if we found, as a result of the very close day to day studies that we carry out on Portuguese Timor and also on relations with Indonesia and Portugal, that it was a desirable thing to do we would certainly give it consideration. </para>

            <para>-For three or four hours on Tuesday of last week this matter was traversed before an Estimates Committee. The departmental officers from Darwin gave a full and detailed statement on it. I suggest that the reply to all parts of the question is in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of that Estimates Committee meeting last week. On the question of the success of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, I think everything possible has been done to re-house people as quickly as possible. The <inline font-style="italic">Patris</inline> has been hired to provide hostel-type accommodation. Information on the number of caravans that have been hired is in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. The delay in the construction of new homes is because of the formation of a building standard which will mean that buildings must be cyclone proof and because of the desirability to make more homes available for habitation by reconstructing damaged homes rather than constructing new homes. Contracts for over 1000 homes have been let. They must be completed within 12 months. I believe that the production under those contracts will commence before the end of this year. </para>

            <para>-I have a reply which I promised <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> yesterday to a question which he asked on 2 October. He asked about the matter again yesterday. I explained to him that although I had the information from the Department I was seeking clarification on a couple of points. The question related to Australians imprisoned in Yugoslavia. As far as my Department is aware, over the last 2 years- that is, since October 1973- a total of 13 Australian citizens, of whom 10 were dual nationals, have been in Yugoslav prisons. Seven of the 10 dual nationals were charged with offences under articles of the Yugoslav Criminal Code relating to political activities. There are 5 dual nationals currently in prison in Yugoslavia. Four of these are charged with political offences, 2 of them having been in gaol when my Government came to office. To my knowledge, no Australian citizen, whether dual national or not, has been imprisoned in Yugoslavia without charges being laid against him or on charges merely of membership of bodies such as Australian soccer clubs. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In all cases of Australian citizens imprisoned in Yugoslavia, we have sought information about them, and in a number of cases consular access as well. This has been done both by note and by personal representation to the Yugoslav authorities. Honourable senators may be assured that efforts made by Australian representatives have been constant and continuous. The Government is making every effort to protect the interests of Australian citizens who might face charges in Yugoslavia. No Australian government has secured better arrangements or greater protection for its citizens in Yugoslavia in these circumstances than we have. </para>
          <para>I would like to reiterate what I said in the Senate in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> remarks on 30 September, that we inherited a situation where there was little or nothing the Australian Government could do to protect the interests of dual Australian- Yugoslav nationals arrested and tried in Yugoslavia. As I said, this was because the previous Government had done nothing about the situation. We have made great efforts to improve the situation and we have made progress. Consultations are continuing, and I can assure the Senate that this Government will do all that is possible to protect the interests of the people concerned. Neither those people nor the Government&#39;s efforts on their behalf are likely to be helped by irresponsible and grossly misleading allegations of the sort which have been put about last week concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Marko</inline> Nazor and his wife. </para>
          <para>Since coming into the chamber I have been handed a note about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Marko</inline> Nazor. We have just been advised by the Embassy in Belgrade that TANJUG- the official Yugoslav newsagency has announced that the District Court in Split has issued a bill of indictment against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline> charging him under article 117, paragraph 2, of the Yugoslavian Criminal Code with the offence of &#39;Association Against the People and State&#39;. I am advised that the penalty for this offence is imprisonment and no death sentence is applicable. </para>

            <para>In regard to the effect that budget proposals will have on the recruiting levels, the size of the army and the other two services will be retained at their present approved levels of 1 6 1 1 5 for the navy, 3 1 500 for the army and 2 1 55 1 for the air force.

              <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen&#39;s</inline>other questions related to a waiting list for people wishing to join the armed forces. This is so. In a situation of parity with authorised manning levels, controls have to be applied to recruiting input to ensure that the authorised ceilings for defence force manpower generally are not exceeded. As normal wastage occurs on a monthly basis throughout the year recruiting inputs are adjusted to meet these outgoings. The current level of inquiries and applications to join the services has resulted in some waiting time being imposed on certain musterings and categories of enlistment. This applies particularly to the navy and the air force. The army is currently controlling the intake of male general enlistments on a monthly target basis. </para>

            <para>-I appreciate what the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee)</inline> said this morning with regard to matters upon which I had earlier directed inquiries to him. I particularly appreciate the fact that he is keeping the Senate informed about what is happening to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Marco</inline> Nazor. But I am concerned that the information which the Minister gave this morning is information which comes from a newspaper report. I believe it is important that the Australian Government should be far more active on behalf of Australian nationals who are put in prison by totalitarian countries than it has been in the past. I seek from the Minister further information as to whether officials of the Australian Embassy in Yugoslavia have been able to see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor.</inline> He has been in prison for almost 4 months and I understand that not one member of the Embassy has been able to see him. I would like the Minister to say how many efforts have been made to see him; to whom have the requests been made that Australian Embassy officials do see him; by whom have those requests been denied; and what protests at a ministerial or Prime Ministerial level have been made by the Australian Government in trying to find out what is his condition and what is the response of an Australian citizen to what is being alleged against him. 1 understand from what the Minister says that the only information of the charges which are made against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline> is contained in the newspaper report. We know this particular provision of the Yugoslav code which makes it a crime for a person apparently to associate with others against the Yugoslav state. We also know that the Yugoslav Embassy in Australia apparently requires a confession from Australians of the associations they have in this country before they are allowed to return to Yugoslavia to see their relatives. Apparently that does not always help because I understand it has not helped <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline> in this case. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think it should be understood that the type of offences for which so many of these people whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> declares in his statement today to be dual nationals- they are Australian citizens but he calls them dual nationals- are charged are the alleged crimes of membership of organisations in Australia. I believe that it is important for people to appreciate that that is the type of charge which can be made in Yugoslavia and for which persons are imprisoned. I ask the Minister to table in the Senate the text of the representations which have been made on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline> so that there can be some assessment as to how earnest this Government&#39;s pleas are on behalf of an Australian citizen. I think it is totally unsatisfactory that Australian citizens should be left to languish and for the Australian Government apparently to wash its hands of people and to say that nothing can be done. </para>
          <para>There are things which the Australian Government can do. It can protest. It can create a public outcry. It can condemn publicly. It can in the world scene pinpoint the fact that a government is acting in this ruthless and unreasonable way, denying freedoms and human rights. It can seek to bring to bear all the pressures of the United Nations against a government which acts in this way against the nationals of another country. This Government has not been slow in seeking to have South Africa expelled from the United Nations because of the way in which it regards the South African Government as having behaved towards individuals in its country. Accepting the Government&#39;s statement that it is entitled to that view, why is it not consistent and why is it not at least prepared to be active on behalf of Australian citizens when, as the Minister said this morning, some 13 of them have been imprisoned in Yugoslavia over the last 2 years? I am just wondering how many people in this country would have been aware of the fact that that number of Australian citizens had been imprisoned in a communist country if I had not asked the question? </para>

          <para>I think that the absence of action by this Government contrasts with the action taken by the Canadian Government approximately 2 years ago- about the time when this crackdown by the Yugoslav Government against its Croatian minority first began to bite throughout the world. When a Croatian Canadian was imprisoned in Yugoslavia it was the matter of outcry by the Canadian Press that a citizen had been imprisoned and there was a call to the Government to take action. The Prime Minister of Canada was prepared to come out and publicly condemn or criticise the Government of Yugoslavia and to expect that the rights of Canadian citizens would be upheld. </para>
          <para>I understand from what I have been informed that the attitude adopted by the Yugoslav Government to Croatian Canadians visiting Yugoslavia is totally different from the attitude adopted by the Yugoslav Government to Croatian Australians who visit that country. I believe that one of the reasons for the difference in attitude is that the Canadian Government was prepared to stand up to the Yugoslav Government. I believe that the Australian Government is not prepared to stand up to the Yugoslav Government. If it has been prepared to protest and to raise its voice in condemnation then I ask the Minister to table the protests which have been made and the messages which have been sent so that that position can be clarified. If in fact, in the face of strong protests, the Yugoslav Government has not been prepared to act the people throughout the world will be the better informed of the character of that particular Government. I believe that the case which can be then made against the Yugoslav Government on behalf of Australian citizens will be all the stronger. </para>
          <para>In this context I think it is not only the Australian Government which ought to be looking to what are its obligations. It is a great pity also that the Australian Press cannot be relied on to be as outspoken on behalf of Australian citizens as apparently the Canadian Press was outspoken on behalf of Canadian citizens when their freedom and their rights were denied to them in another country. One is left with the conclusion that the freedom of the Press is a freedom for the Press itself and not the freedom of other people. It would make a tremendous difference if the Press of this country were concerned about the rights of people that are denied in other countries and were prepared to emblazon that fact in its pages, but one finds that there is virtually no information currently in the Australian Press about Australian citizens who are imprisoned overseas. I am quite sure that the Minister would endorse that aspect because it would certainly help him and the Government if there were some outcry from the Australian Press to protect those people. </para>
          <para>What have been the reasons given by the Minister in response to the questions I have raised? I have had from the Minister time and again the allegation that all I am doing is playing politics. I suppose that to the extent that one challenges a government to be outspoken on behalf of its citizens who are imprisoned overseas there is a political challenge and a political attack. If that is the only way in which one can achieve the rights of citizens then I am afraid there has to be that sort of politics played. I believe that so long as a government is tardy in asserting the rights of its citizens it is subject to and ought to be subject to legitimate political challenge. </para>
          <para>The second argument which the Minister has given is that to ask questions on these matters is to exacerbate troubles. He says that one should be silent about them. I wish that the Minister would give some further particulars as to how asking questions about Australian citizens imprisoned overseas will exacerbate troubles. The trouble is that these people are imprisoned; that we cannot get them out or have them dealt with on the basis of conduct in that country which constitutes an offence against the laws of the country in which they are imprisoned and not on some alleged association outside the country. It is not an exacerbating of those troubles to pinpoint the fact that Australian citizens are imprisoned. If we were not prepared to raise our voice on these matters, how many other Australian citizens would be imprisoned? What prospects would people have to ensure that their rights would be protected and what sort of a Parliament would this be if, when a voice is sought to be raised on behalf of an individual, we are told to be quiet. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline>went to Yugoslavia in the early part of this year with his wife and family. I understand that for 3 months not a voice was raised. He has few relatives in this country and very few friends. I have been spoken to by some people who are trying to have something done. I believe that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> have received a letter from one identity in the Croatian community, as has the  Speaker  in the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> I understand that the case for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline> has been put rationally and reasonably. He is not a person who has had any association with any of the Croatian organisations in this country. If that is incorrect, I ask the Minister to inform me. I understand that his sole connection with Croatia is the fact that he happened to have been born there and that he worshipped in a Croatian church. That is the sole connection he has. He is not a member of the Croatian Soccer Club or any of the other national organisations to which most Croatians belong and to which most of the other ethnic minorities in this country belong. Of course, that is merely an argument as to why possibly in his case more than in another case there could be absolutely no basis to the charges that are being raised against him. </para>
          <para>The only point I wish to make in conclusion is this: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline> is not the only person affected. What has been revealed in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline> and these other persons, numbered but not named this morning by the Minister, is the tip of an iceberg. I ask the Minister: Why have I not had a reply about a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pavlovic</inline> about whom I wrote, not to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> but to the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> on 18 July 1974 when he applied for a passport. I have raised the matter in the Senate on 2 occasions, in April and June of this year. I last wrote in respect of this man on 8 July 1975. Perhaps within the last months I wrote, again, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I have sought an explanation as to why no passport has been granted. Was it only because this man happens to have been born in Croatia? He is an Australian citizen and he is entitled to an explanation. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> who said in June of this year that I could look at the files. I took up that invitation but so far I have had no response to the request. I think it is incumbent upon the Minister, because I understand the matter has been in his Department for the past 3 months, at least to provide me with an answer as to what is his position. What about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Popovich</inline> another gentleman who was born in Croatia who sought a passport and in respect of whom I wrote to the Minister late in August? I have had an acknowledgement from his private secretary but no further information. What about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vlisic</inline> whose case was mentioned in the news within the last fortnight? </para>
          <para>What of all the others, whose names I will not mention now because I expect and hope that some response will be given by the Ministers of the Crown- the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> and the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee)-</inline> to explain whether or not there is a vendetta against Croatian born Australians or an attitude which treats them as second class Australians who are not entitled to the rights which other Australians have. I know that these are serious allegations, but in the representations which I have made on behalf of these people certainly there is a basis for believing there has been a denial of their civil liberties. I assure the Minister that until some clear indication is given by the Government that it is prepared to act on behalf of Australian citizens and to ensure that they get protection overseas I will continue to raise this matter. </para>
          <para>It is a great pity that so many Croatian-born Australians want to go back to Croatia, to Yugoslavia, because they run the risk whenever they go back that they will be imprisoned. Such advice as I am able to convey to them suggests that they must give up any hope of returning to their homeland because the type of government which runs that country apparently has a particular set against Croatian-born Australians. I should think that the Minister also could urge people not to go back to Yugoslavia because if it be the position that the Government is not able to do all that it would like to do to help them when they are there, at least that would help the position. In the light of what has been happening, I think that is the least the Minister can do. </para>

            <para>- Before the Minister replies, I want to make a few observations. Firstly, in respect of the cases that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> instanced, if he looks at the JAT airline loadings on flights between Australia and Yugoslavia he will find that those cases are the exception, and it is a deliberate lie to say that everybody who goes back to Yugoslavia can expect to be interrogated by the UDBA or somebody else. In relation to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Greenwood&#39;s second point about everybody being black or white, I remind him of the classic case of Srecko Rover, which occurred under his Government. The Liberal-Country Party Government for good and sufficient reasons, would not give him a passport to leave this country. If there are any people in that category under this Government, then it is only following the policy of its predecessors. In any case, even conceding that there may have been miscarriages of justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> will agree with me that we could substitute cases involving Spanish and Greek nationals. I have not had an opportunity to talk to the Minister for a couple of days, but at this time I know several Greeks who have sought permanent domicile in Australia. True, they have deserted their ships. One man has a wife and child and he has been on the run for 2 years. Even with the new Government in Greece, he is afraid that because he ignored an Army call-up he could be dealt with back there. </para>
          <para>The message I give to the Senate is that it is no use picking out one country and saying that somebody has breached the law. The matter should be taken a little further than that. Government senators are not fools. If an Australianborn person or a person of Yugoslav origin is involved in drug running and has taken some goods into Trieste on a customs lurk, he runs foul of the law. Do not imagine that every person who is apprehended is involved in political activities. Those are the facts of life. I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> that it is not only in that part of the world that these things happen. I dealt successfully with the British High Commissioner with a case involving an Australian girl with a husband who travelled on an Irish passport and who got into an altercation with British troops in Belfast. It is not hard to gather what happened.  Her  husband finished up in Long Kench. Without going to the Press or radio or television, I was able to act as mediator and a satisfactory settlement was reached. I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> that he and I know that Yugoslav people are of extremely volatile temperament, but the same situation would occur if a person became involved in an abusive action about Franco or the present Greek Government. There would be trouble with the law. I take it a little further than that. There are a number of Croatians who still have not got the message about trying to lead a little more temperate life here. That has been manifest with a number of them on ethnic radio. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was never very vocal about Greeks and Spaniards who were being affected. </para>
          <para>There is need for any government to practise restraint. The Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Greenwood was a member had to practise restraint in the case of Srecko Rover, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> knows that. The activities of Srecko Rover had to be curbed. If our Government has to act similarly, that is just too bad. Perhaps some people have made representations to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> A member of the Australian Labor Party came to me on behalf of another person whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> did not mention. I said: &#39;You can bring your chap along to see me&#39;. This chap was an aeronautical engineer. He wanted to go to Chicago to improve his industrial know how. I asked him whether he would give me an assurance he would not get involved in some terrorist body in America. He said: &#39;No, I will not give that assurance&#39;. I said: You can stew in your own juice&#39;. That is an indication of the rough justice I apply but, it is justice. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir MAGNUS</inline>CORMACK (Victoria) (12.0)- I intend briefly to enter into this debate. In the administration of previous governments, as well as in this Government, I have been most concerned about our inability or our lack of will to deal with the matter of dual citizenship. Earlier, when the United States of America was involved in ethnic problems with the vast waves of migrants entering the United States of America, it made it quite clear that when a migrant came to the United States of America, applied for citizenship and was granted that citizenship by swearing to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America, he had fulfilled the constitutional requirements of the United States of America to become an American citizen. At that stage, he or she was entitled to the care, observation and protection of the United States wherever they went in the world. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline>may recollect, if he turns up the Acts of the Apostles, that when Paul of Tarsus was accused and condemned to be thrashed he claimed before the Roman Governor that he was a Roman citizen. No one could touch him because he was a Roman citizen. The British, when they were responsible for maintenance of law and order and justice in large parts of the world in the 18th and certainly 19th century, would never allow a British citizen to be treated in the way in which Australian citizens are treated in various parts of the world. In fact, if the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee)</inline> took some care to read his history, he would recollect that one of the great foreign ministers of the United Kingdom in the 19th century, Palmerston, made that great speech in the House of Commons in which he quoted the Latin phrase, <inline font-style="italic">civis Britannicus sum.- I</inline> am a British citizen. He proclaimed that wherever the British citizen went he would be protected. I will raise this matter later as a matter of policy. </para>
          <para>I suggest that there are some unsatisfactory aspects of the reply of the Minister to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> There are many methods of dealing with foreign governments in these matters, irrespective of who the individual involved may be. I assume, but it has never been said by the Minister, that he has sent for the Yugoslav Ambassador to Australia and instructed him. Is that a method of dealing with foreign governments that has gone out of fashion? Have any members of the Australian embassy in Belgrade sought to see that this man- an Australian citizen- at least has been given the care and protection that a prisoner in an Australian gaol would be entitled to get? At least, in our country, writs of habeas corpus can be issued. That does not seem to work in these fraternal socialist countries to which I have heard reference. </para>
          <para>Lastly, I want to make this point: There are great sanctions that the Government can exert in the protection of its citizens. There are great sanctions which can be applied. I do not want to exacerbate the situation any further by nominating what some of these sanctions are. But there are great powers in the hands of the Australian Government to protect its citizens abroad, whether they are in Greece, Italy, Yugoslavia, Spain or anywhere else. I am sick and tired of people travelling abroad carrying an Australian passport signed by the Governor-General and issued under the auspices of the foreign service of this country not being allowed to pass without let or hindrance. What is it, a worthless document? Any secret policeman and any government can arrest an Australian citizen on some trumped charge of guilt by assertion and put him in gaol. The Government claims that there is nothing it can do to help them. If the matter of the protection of an Australian citizen abroad is raised in this place, we are told in glib phrases that we are not helping the situation. I do not believe for one moment that the Minister wrote that answer to the question that he read out here. It bore all the hallmarks of an official of the Department of Foreign Affairs. I end on that assertion. I have not forgotten this matter. I will raise it again in association with my colleagues on this side of the House. </para>

          <para class="block">Party was in government, that is, that the Australian Government should assist in the protection of its citizens whether they have dual citizenship or not. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> attitude was somewhat hypocritical and the interjection from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> underlined that hypocrisy. Towards the end of his statement <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> referred to the desirability of persons who are dual citizens being warned of the difficulties they face if they go back to their country of origin. This is advice which must be given to them. There are many people who come from some eastern European countries who come to me seeking assistance with visas and my advice to them is that they ought not to go no matter how strong the need and no matter how strong the impulse to go back because the laws of the country from which they came follow them into this country. This they must recognise. Although they may have taken out Australian citizenship, if they are in breach of those laws while they are here they are held responsible for that breach and can suffer for it when they go back. This advice does not seem to be given to people before they go back to their country of origin which still recognises them as citizens of that country. </para>

I have insisted that when Australian embassies find that a person who has accepted Australian citizenship is in trouble they should go to their defence. While the Opposition was in government I insisted on many occasions that the Australian embassies should keep in close contact with these people and assist them, and in many cases they did assist them. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is getting at. The embassies should give even greater assistance to those people than they would give to a person who holds single citizenship. </para>

He does not suffer from this dual citizenship problem but he is in gaol. Several approaches have been made following representations from me to have this young Australian deported from South Africa but the South African Government has resisted these approaches. The latest information I have from the Prime Minister, when he was Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, was that representations had been made for this young man to be deported back to Australia. The South African Government insisted that he serve the remainder of his term. The Prime Minister as Acting Foreign Minister stated that he could see no use in making further representations at that time. Perhaps what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> says should hold here also. There should be an outcry about this. This man ought not to be imprisoned in South Africa. </para>

              <para>-For conduct in South Africa but the punishment seems to be oppressive for the breach of which this young man was guilty. Nevertheless, he is an Australian who is in prison there and he ought to be assisted. The reasonable request that he ought to be deported back to Australia should be acceded to by the South African Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is not the only person who is concerned that this is occurring. I think he should spread his concern to other places in which Australians are being put under some restrictions, including even restrictions in relation to their freedom. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is at fault in that he seems to concentrate only upon Yugoslavia and he seems to have some sort of factional approach to the problem of dual citizens. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack &#39;s statement that the embassies must take a stronger initiative on behalf of these people. There ought to be- I think the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee)</inline> has indicated this also- international conferences between those nations affected in an effort to solve the problem of dual citizenship. A person who goes back to Greece can suffer some penalty even under the present regime. Greece takes the view: Once a Greek, always a Greek. That view does not apply only to the first generation; it can carry over to the second generation as well. I find that situation- quite unacceptable and the sooner it is resolved the better. If as a result of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> complaints there are further discussions which lead to a clarification or solution of the problem, then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> complaints are justified. </para>

            <para>- The debate certainly has covered the globe. One thing with which I want to dispense immediately- it amazes me that it has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges, Senator Greenwood</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack- is the contention that Australian embassies do not care about what happens to Australian citizens overseas. That is just not the case. Ever since I have been Minister for Foreign Affairs I have insisted many times that extra care be taken and that extra drive and initiative must be shown in relation to all consular cases. A consular case can range from somebody who finds himself broke in a country and goes along to the Embassy for help, somebody who is up on a drunk and disorderly charge, to somebody who is up on a political charge. To say that our embassies are not doing anything for these people is just not on. When an Australian citizen, whether he be of dual nationality or a purely Australian citizen, suffers the rigours of the law, people immediately come to my office and say that he ought to be let off, that he is perfectly innocent, before they have looked at the evidence or anything else. If Australian citizens break the law overseas there is nothing we can do to prevent their suffering the penalties of the law. Exactly the same situation applies if a foreigner to this country breaks the law in this country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I might say in passing- I have 2 cases in my mind at the moment- that when the law was being properly applied in foreign countries we were able, by influence and by making a plea without any legal basis, to get the people concerned out of gaol. One of the people I have in mind had served 2 years of a 10-year sentence. Because he was a young man at the time of the offence- it was a drug pushing charge, quite a bad offence- we pleaded: &#39;Look, he is a long way from home. He is a young chap. He has served 2 years in gaol. Let him out. &#39; That plea was successful and he was let out. On another occasion we were able, without any legal authority at all on our side, to prevent people from even going to gaol because of our pleas. So it is quite unfair to say that the embassies do not take up these matters at every possible opportunity. </para>
          <para>It is also quite unfair to say that the Government was uncaring about the situations which used to occur in Greece- I knew more about that under the previous regime- and in Yugoslavia. It amazes me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> makes an attack in this regard because he knows that his Government did not get to first base and did nothing about the situation in Yugoslavia. I have checked with our officers who were in the embassies in those days under the previous Government. It amazes them that we have been able to go as far as we have with the Yugoslav authorities because of the hard line that they take. They claim that they have the greater right on dual nationals. As I understand it, they have international law on their side. As I understand the law, the country in which a dual national was born has the greater right on him. The law is in favour of that country. Because of the international law situation the Yugoslav authorities will not listen to the arguments of another nation. </para>

              <para>-Yes. We did so when we first came to office. The problem there is that a precedent would be set. The Yugoslav authorities say that the moment they enter into an agreement with us they naturally set a precedent for anybody else. They quote to us countries such as the United States of America and Canada, as well as European countries, because there are so many Yugoslavs in other countries. That was the problem and it still is. In spite of it, the Yugoslav authorities have come a certain way along the track. </para>

When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> raised his first point I nodded to him that I was in sympathy with him. A cable has been handed to me. I may be wrong, but the information that has been handed to me since I came into the chamber today- it is information from the official Yugoslav Government gazette or newsagency, which is always gospel from the Governmentis that we have not been told about it. If the Department has not already protested and asked why, it certainly will because I will tell it to do so. I imagine it has already done so. The Yugoslav authorities always take this tough line: These are our nationals. These people are committing criminal acts against us. Therefore, we have the right to proceed within the law &#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> criticised the Yugoslav law. I cannot do anything about it. I do not write it.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline>made the point that people would have been unaware of the situation if he had not raised it. He asked how the people would have known. I suggest to him that a lot of people are in trouble, and the public does not know about them. Some of them are on drug charges, some them are on drunk and disorderly charges, and so on. Of course they are not known, if the papers do not pick up the cases. Our embassies come into the picture if people are convicted and imprisoned. Embassy officials visit the gaol and see that the prisoners are doing as well as they can in a gaol situation. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline>said that I deliberately drew a distinction between dual nationals and Australians. I did. One of the reasons I sent back yesterday the answer which I gave earlier was that I wanted to be perfectly clear on this matter. Three Australians who are not dual nationals received 21 days gaol for an incident on the coast. Obviously it was not a political incident. Maybe they were a little high spirited. </para>

              <para>- He was approached subsequently. Originally he read the information in the paper. Subsequently he was approached by somebody. I am glad that I did not say anything about it the other day because evidently he had not been approached then. Obviously these people were building up a case as part of a propaganda machine for their political causes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> repeated what he read in the paper. He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline> had been sentenced to execution. That was a lie. He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Nazor</inline> was given 6 years or was being charged. That was a lie. I object to false accusations being made. I do not mind anybody bringing matters before me. I do not mind their coming to me in my office. I want to be as helpful as I possibly can. If they do not want to talk to me at that level and give me their information, so be it. If they like to raise the matter in the chamber, which I do not think is the best way in these cases, that is fine, there are no objections. </para>

          <para>Recently I said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was more interested in exacerbating a difficult position between 3 countries than he was in helping the individual concerned.  His  Government had done nothing about this question, but we have been moving on it in the 3 years in which we have been a government. I charged <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> with being more interested in that than in the people concerned, but he rejected this. I still say that there were better ways in which he could have gone about this matter. I do not mind questions being asked about it, although I do not like it. I reject questions when they are based on lies. </para>
          <para>In regard to the question about a man being held by the South Vietnamese Government or the Provisional Revolutionary Government, I said that this was a situation which was quite different from the one about which we have been talking. In the heat of war a man was captured and is still being held by the troops. We have consistently done something about this matter. If it is true that possession is 9 points of the law, they have the 9 points. We are moving on a diplomatic basis to try to get this man released. I have written to his family about the matter and I understand that officers of my Department have talked to his family. I wrote to members of his family in Perth only recently telling them of the latest moves and sympathising with them in the great worry that they must be suffering. It is all a matter of judgment. We still have not reestablished our embassy in South Vietnam, and we are talking about all sorts of other things. </para>
          <para>I believe that we have a greater chance of getting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlock</inline> out of the hands of the persons who are holding him. Whether they term him as being a prisoner or not I do not know, but he is being held arising out of the war. I believe that we have a better chance of getting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlock</inline> out of gaol by letting our diplomats do it and by letting me and, if necessary, the Prime Minister maintain the pressures at the level at which we talk to representatives from other countries. All the matters stated in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlock</inline> were true; this was not the case in allegations made about the Government&#39;s handling of the Nazor case. There were 2 different cases. They are the points that I make, and I believe that they are valid. I do not believe that you help your case or help a person who is in gaol if you base the case on lies. In regard to the second case, which is a peculiar case, it is just my judgment that it is better to leave the matter to diplomacy, to quietly step up our campaign to try to get this man out of gaol. I would have preferred not to talk about this matter, and it was not I who raised it in the public arena. </para>
          <para>To sum up, why would any embassy, why would any Minister, want to say that if an Australian is in trouble overseas we do not do our best for him? We find out what the charges are. We talk to him and so on. That is the first point. Secondly, it is quite untrue and unfair to say that for some unknown reason, because a person is a Yugoslav, because he is of dual nationality, we are not interested in him. There is the problem on which, I repeat, the previous Government never got to first base but on which we have made some progress. </para>
          <para>The instructions from me to the Department are quite clear: Irrespective of the countries involved, irrespective of the seriousness of the charge or the minutiae of the case, these people should be protected and helped as much as they possibly can by a government. That does not mean that if they break the law overseas we can do anything about it. The laws under which they are sent to gaol may seem harsh to us. In fact they are harsh. One has only to look at some of the laws under which people are being executed in countries very much closer to us. They are laws that we would never accept in this country, that is perfectly true; but nobody in this Parliament can do anything about re-writing those laws. Therefore, we have to work within the parameters set for us. I resent and reject the proposition that embassies do not care about these people. Sometimes it is difficult to find out about these people. Perhaps somebody gets drunk or acts in a disorderly manner and is thrown into gaol and we are not told about it. We have to find out the best way that we can. There may be a breakdown, although we insist that we expect the authorities in all these countries to tell us about these matters. Obviously it is very easy for these things to break down in the bureaucracy. At all stages our people do the best they can. </para>
          <para>In regard to the very difficult question of dual citizenship, we have made progress where the previous Government did not. We want to make more progress. We are not satisfied when we cannot get consular access when we require it. We have not been able to get that yet, but we are working on it. We have made progress and we hope to make more progress. </para>

I am not objecting to the Australian Mutual Provident Society making contributions of whatever kind, be they of goods, services or cash, to any political Party. All I am asking is that if the Society does so it conducts a ballot amongst its policy holders in the same way as trade unions do; that it makes the contributions completely public; that if it so wishes it affiliates with the Liberal Party, and that it be prepared to become as clearly identified with the National Country Party as the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union is with the Australian Labor Party.
