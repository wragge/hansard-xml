            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. I refer to the comments by the Coroner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Leo,</inline> in the Cooma Coroner&#39;s Court, following the death of 2 men in July when a bus plunged down a ravine near Thredbo. The Coroner suggested that all buses should carry tachographs- I have checked the pronunciation of &#39;tachographs&#39; with the Minister for Science- to record speeds at which the vehicles travelled and which would also indicate the speed when a bus left the road. Can the Minister say whether transport authorities are prepared to consider the Coroner&#39;s proposals and whether there is a plan to require safety belts in all touring buses? </para>

            <para>-A11 I can tell the honourable senator at this stage is that I understand that the Australian Transport Advisory Committee has considered in particular the question of accidents involving buses which are occurring too frequently. Over the last 18 months, the Committee has made a number of regulations. More recently, in August, it adopted by consent a regulation that buses should have brake inspections. This has been enforced. Before that, the Committee also formulated and agreed upon what was to be a uniform inspection code. The problem of course is that most of these things have to be agreed to within the States. The uniform code was determined by concensus. In addition, I understand that the Minister has been promoting the idea that the provision and wearing of seatbelts not only by drivers but also by passengers ought to be enforced. Structurally, the vehicle ought to be inspected and supervised for safety standards generally speaking. Proposals also are being considered in respect of the style and strength of seating. The Advisory Committee has had these things in mind. As to whether the Minister himself or the Advisory Committee has recommended the enforcement of the use of tachographs on each vehicle, I am not sure. All I can do is ask the Minister to advise me in connection with that part of the question. </para>

Does the Minister acknowledge that competence in duty and knowledge of a trade are attractive qualifications in executive members and employees of any business concern? Will the Minister, on behalf of these dismissed employees who may be disadvantaged in the present economic climate, have some investigation made and satisfy himself that the replacements to the positions are made in the interests of the Corporation and not for personal aggrandisement and that, more particularly, the actions which have occurred recently are in the interests of the dairy industry? </para>

            <para>-I would refer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> to an article in <inline font-style="italic">Butter Fats and Solids,</inline> the official journal of the Victorian Butter Manufacturers Association, on the newly appointed Australian Dairy Corporation. I specifically suggest to him that he read the article because the editor of that magazine who wrote the article said that he does not sit on either side of the political fence. He gave an impartial assessment of the appointments which have been made to the Corporation. I might say that he paid a very obvious compliment to the Australian Government for the expertise and the quality of the people which it has now placed on the newly formed Australian Dairy Corporation in contrast to those who occupied those same positions on the old Dairy Board and who were appointed by the previous Government. It has been drawn to my attention that some dismissals have taken place on the staff of the Corporation. 1 have already asked the newly appointed  chairman  to give me some information about this matter, and I am meeting him in Melbourne on Monday to discuss that amongst other matters. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister for Police and Customs. No doubt the Minister has seen or heard of Press reports of a substantial amount of cannabis having been found by a fisherman on a lonely island off Geraldton on the western coast of Western Australia. Can the Minister provide the Senate with any further details concerning this find? More importantly, what action is being taken by his Department to prevent the smuggling of drugs in remote areas along the Australian coastline? </para>

            <para>-Surveillance of the Australian coastline is a problem. The possibility of smuggling drugs along our unoccupied coastline has been one of the concerns I think of all Ministers for Customs over the past years. It is one of my great concerns. We have tried to patrol the coast as much as possible with limited manpower and facilities. We have used both military and chartered aircraft from time to time to try to patrol the coast. The Department has recently taken delivery of an ocean-going patrol boat and after some trials it will be used for patrolling the north-east coast of Australia. Later this year we hope to take delivery of a second such patrol boat which will patrol the north-west coast of Australia. </para>

          <para>As regards the drugs found at Geraldton, it is thought that there was about 100 lb of marijuana. It was in a container which obviously had been specially made for dumping from ships to be picked up by other lighter ships and taken ashore. It was an aluminium container with a battery in the bottom and a light on the top so that it would show up in the night. The container came ashore. It was discovered by a party of fishermen. During the night someone got to the container and recovered a lot of the marihuana. As the matter is still under investigation and as some charges may be laid, there is very little more that I can say on the question. I assure the honourable senator that this matter of drug smuggling is one of our concerns. We are doing everything possible in accordance with the Budget restrictions at present and our ability to get suitable aids for the purpose of searching the coast. </para>

            <para>- I think a question on this matter was asked some time ago. I indicated then that the effect of the change in the taxation system was designed to apply to all Australians and not to any one section. I am quite sure that no one section of the Australian people would expect to derive from the system benefits which others did not derive. As to the specific details of the effect that the new system has on the averaging arrangements for primary producers, this is a matter which 1 would need to refer to the Treasurer to get a specific answer. But what I have said is that the averaging arrangements for primary producers have not been affected by the Budget. If there have been effects under the rebate system on the averaging plan for primary producers, it is a matter which I would need to ascertain precisely from the Treasurer and I shall do so. I will advise the honourable senator accordingly. </para>

            <para>- Yes, I have seen the news item to which the honourable senator refers. I must say that I was surprised that a gentleman like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street-</inline> I mean that seriously- could so misrepresent the facts. I think it arises out of a misunderstanding of the functions of the Commonwealth Employment Service in the matter of school leavers. My Department is not discouraging school leavers from looking for jobs. The Commonwealth Employment Service has a duty to advise its clients regarding their possible entitlement to social security benefits. This is particularly important in the case of school leavers who have had no previous experience with the labour market and are often unaware of their entitlements. The Commonwealth Employment Service operates a youth employment program which includes both group and individual counselling of young people in schools. I am pleased to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street</inline> has been able to confirm that the officers of my Department are doing their job of advising young people properly. I would be disturbed if this were not so. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>What I should emphasise is that advice regarding unemployment benefits forms part of a package of advice which includes encouragement in seeking employment. The Commonwealth Employment Service youth employment officers give advice to school leavers on the avenues through which they may obtain employment, on the best method of application and the like. The program culminates in active assistance to school leavers by referral to prospective employers. The Commonwealth Employment Service is, at the moment, undertaking a national campaign seeking from employers vacancies suitable for school leavers. </para>
          <para>In passing, I must comment on the inference of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street</inline> that if school leavers are advised of their entitlement to unemployment benefit, they will choose not to work. I think that is a gratuitous reflection on the attitudes on most young Australians. By and large school leavers are not interested in unemployment benefit. What they want is satisfying employment and both the Government and the community must do everything possible to encourage and assist them. </para>

However, the claims against Medibank are, in value, under $8m a week. It was predicted that the level of claims against Medibank would be more than $l4m a week when it was operating fully. If honourable senators are interested, I can give the current figures on claims. I think they would show that the predictions which were made and the statements which are now being made are quite false. In July, 160 000 claims were made against Medibank. The total cost was somewhat less than $ 13.5m. In August almost 3 million claims were made against Medibank. The total cost was somewhat less than $30m. </para>

            <para>-My attention has been drawn to this letter. It was from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tom</inline> O&#39;Mahony who, I am distressed to see, has an Irish name, and who is described as the senior partner of O&#39;Mahony, Neville and Morgan, a firm of architects. He said that the architects are not being paid because of funds being directed to provide for what he refers to as &#39;the huge cost of Medibank and similar policies&#39;. There is absolutely no truth whatsoever in this allegation. The funds are quite separate. Very large sums of money- I have the figures here but I will not go into the details as I think all honourable senators are aware of them- have been made available for aged persons institutions under both the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act and the Aged Persons Hostels Act. Provision has been made to ensure that in those cases where out of pocket expenses, including architect&#39;s fees, have been incurred by persons involved in the building of these homes and hostels, they are being met. The allegation is completely incorrect. It has no substance whatsoever. The funds of the Health Insurance Commission are totally separate from the funds which are involved in the provision of aged or disabled persons&#39; homes and hostels. </para>

              <para>- I am sorry; I missed the last part of the honourable senator&#39;s question. Currently before the Government there are 4 IAC reports. It is a matter of discretion and Government policy whether they are dealt with individually or collectively. My view is that they ought to be dealt with collectively in their overall impact on the rural sector. The reports which are yet to come, particularly those in respect of, say, the dairy industry or the fruit industry, could and almost certainly will be dealt with separately. Before the Commission there are currently 2 inquiries on superphosphate- the one on new lands and the one on the general reference- and the inquiry on income stabilisation. The pending report on beef and also the one on brucellosis, I think, are best dealt with collectively and that is almost certainly what the Government&#39;s approach will be. </para>

            <para>- Yesterday afternoon a group of some 50 people, many of them students, occupied the ground floor of the Indonesian Embassy in Canberra. They were protesting against alleged actions of the Indonesian armed forces which, according to one Press report, clashed with Fretilin forces inside Portuguese Timor. The demonstrators left the Indonesian Embassy after 2 hours. The demonstration was peaceful. Officers of the Australian Capital Territory section of the Australia Police were in attendance throughout. The Government has no information to confirm the Press report that there have been clashes between Indonesian and Fretilin forces inside Portuguese Timor. The Government is aware of course that tension has been building up in the border areas. Clashes between rival Timorese factions inside Portuguese Timor have spilled over into Indonesian Timor several times since 24 September. A number of mortar rounds were fired upon the Indonesian village of Motaain on 24 September. Subsequently Indonesia announced that it was reinforcing its forces on the Indonesian side of the border. </para>

          <para>The problem in the border areas is complicated by the large scale refugee problem which has arisen.

These figures have been confirmed by the International Committee of the Red Cross which also reports that a high proportion of the refugees are women and children. </para>
          <para class="block">The Goverment regrets the deterioration of the situation in the border areas.

Recently the PostmasterGeneral advised the Senate that an Australia Post courier service would be introduced in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra and that terminal services would be set up simultaneously in other capital cities. Is the Minister now in a position to advise when the services will commence? When is a complete courier service proposed for Adelaide? </para>

            <para>- Having been involved in the early stages with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hancock</inline> of my staff in the settling of industrial matters relating to the new services, I am anxious to see that they start as early as possible. I am assured by the Commission that that cannot be done for technical reasons before early February, when those 3 capitals will be serviced completely by a courier service. At the same time there will be terminal facilities, and in Adelaide there will also be sufficient vehicles available to supply a complete courier service for that ciy. It is hoped that as soon as possible after that service starts it will be extended to all capital cities. It is not anticipated that there will be any problems in relation to the private courier services operated because the market indications are that the Post Office courier services have plenty of room for expansion. I am anxious to see the service operate as quickly as possible and I will talk again to the Commission to see whether it is possible to expedite the service. </para>

Whether or not they would have been better off if they had been faceless I would not care to comment at this time. They are not entirely faceless, I would have thought, as far as the general public is concerned because they are well remembered for many notorious acts such as sending troops to Vietnam and buying the FI 1 1 aircraft. If any of them are at present in receipt of age or disability pensions I feel it would be improper for me to reveal this because of the policy of confidentiality which the Department of Social Security and the Department of Repatriation and Compensation follow. </para>

Questions must relate to matters of public affairs with which the Minister is concerned. My submission is that this is a question of purely political content with a degree of humour attached to it, that it is a waste of time and a denial of the right of Opposition senators to ask questions of serious import.

            <para>- I find it somewhat curious that the Opposition is now showing such a tender regard for the Regional Employment Development scheme. I would remind the honourable senator that a couple of Liberal State governments have challenged the legality of the RED scheme in the High Court. It was a scheme that was subject to continuing criticism from the other side of politics while it was in full flight. Yes, it is a fact that a great number of the RED scheme projects for which approval had been given have been cancelled. This is part of the general pruning of the deficit which the Government sought to achieve in framing its Budget. There is a curious lack of coherence in the criticism of our Budget that we receive from the Opposition. For instance, we are accused constantly by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> of keeping the deficit too high. I assume from the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> and from various other questions that have been directed to the curtailment of the RED scheme that what the Opposition really wants us to do is to increase the deficit. I wish that they would make up their minds and let the people of Australia know just what sort of a budget they would have to expect from a government composed of the present Opposition. </para>

              <para>- If the honourable senator is looking for simple answers, the world is simple only to the simple minded. Society is complex and therefore complicated answers are often required. I regret every Regional Employment Development project that had to be abandoned just as I regret every shortcoming in expenditure that is involved in trimming our sails. But the fact is that we judged that we did not have the money to pay out on the RED schemes, many of which had been already approved. I very much regret that Coober Pedy falls into that category. If there are special circumstances, special hardships or an outlay of money that cannot be recovered, I would invite the honourable senator to give me the details of the matter and I will see whether any amends can be made. I was not trying to score any cheap points off him. I was merely explaining the dilemma in which the Government finds itself in respect of the RED schemes. I regret that these schemes have had to be curtailed. </para>

              <para>- And on people. For any ban to be effective it must be a State action. The Police Minister&#39;s Conference held in Canberra on Friday last considered the advisability of putting some ban on replica firearms which could be used in a holdup. Being replicas they are not dangerous but they could be used in a hold-up to frighten someone into handing over money. The unanimous decision of the Conference was that the police commissioners should study the matter and refer back to their State governments. The Conference supported the proposal that there should be through State and Commonwealth legislation a complete prohibition on such replica weapons that could be used to frighten. Two aspects are involved; one is their importation and the other is their manufacture and sale in Australia. </para>

As one may have gathered from some Press reports which appear from time to time, all of us have people who seem to be prepared to talk to newspapers about these things. However, discussions are going on but there has not been any determination made by the Government as to what future course it will adopt on this matter. As soon as a decision has been made it will be announced and I trust that at the time a decision is made there also will be a decision and an announcement made about the means of financing the scheme. </para>

            <para>-This is a rather complicated question which has been raised a number of times in the Senate. It involves the treatment of people in psychiatric nursing homes and requires a little detail in its explanation. I have read the article. The Australian Government provides a quite distinct and separate funding and benefit system for nursing homes- that is, distinct from the Medibank scheme. In fact, it was in operation before Medibank was introduced. Most of the legislation was based on legislation which in fact had been introduced by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. The Aged Persons Hostels Act, for example, was an Act of that previous Government. There will be a substantial increase in the rate of nursing home benefits, as distinct from hospital benefits, in New South Wales from 13 November next, but again that has nothing to do with Medibank; it is a separate arrangement. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The situation with regard to psychiatric hospitals is that where those institutions are conducted by or under the control of State governments they are excluded from Medibank agreements. Under the arrangements which prevailed before the introduction of Medibank patients in government psychiatric institutions were not eligible for hospital benefits. However, there were some difficulties, as one can imagine, in definition in these questions of borderline cases and some patients in 3 psychiatric institutions in New South Wales were paid hospital benefits. With the introduction of the hospital side of Medibank under the agreement which was signed recently by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewis</inline> and which will come into effect on 1 November the opportunity has been taken in New South Wales, as it has been in other States, to correct these anomalies that existed in the past and to bring the payment of hospital benefits into accord with the legislation. </para>
          <para>The whole question of the financing of government psychiatric institutions is to be examined by a working party comprising representatives of each of the State governments as well as the Australian Government. The patients in privately run psychiatric hospitals and in the psychiatric wards of public hospitals remain eligible for hospital benefits. This is not a new problem. It is a problem which existed under the previous National Health Act arrangements and it is a problem which does require some resolution. We are confident that in a spirit of co-operation and compromise between the Australian Government and the States we will be able to resolve the remaining difficulties which face us. </para>

            <para>- We remain committed to negotiation with Papua New Guinea on the distribution of resources and the division of jurisdiction in the Torres Strait. In so doing, we seek to accommodate the interests of all the parties affected- Papua New Guinea, Queensland, Australia and, of course, the Torres Strait Islanders themselves. On 2 April 1974 the Premier of Queensland proposed an international marine park for the Torres Strait area which would protect the environment and control commercial activities. Discussions between Australian and Queensland officials are proceeding on an environmentally protected zone along these lines in the hope of producing agreement on a special regime for the Strait. </para>

          <para>On 23 September the Queensland Premier referred to the amicable discussions between Queensland and Australian officials. Now that Papua New Guinea has become independent it will be for Papua New Guinea and Australia to negotiate a treaty embodying the new regime. The Queensland Premier has endorsed such an approach. On the Papua New Guinea side, the Prime Minister of that country, in his Press conference of 16 September, expressed his confidence that the Queensland Government and the Federal Government would come to some common agreement with Papua New Guinea. The Australian Government is keen to reach agreement with Papua New Guinea and has every expectation of progress towards the resolution of this issue as soon as the constitutional problems are overcome. </para>

            <para>- I address my question to the Postmaster-General, representing the Minister for Environment. At a recent meeting of the South Australian Irrigators Association grave concern was expressed at the continued delay in implementing recommendations of the Gutteridge Haskins and Davey 1970 report on salinity in the River Murray. The report <inline font-style="italic">inter alia</inline> advocated the early removal of evaporation ponds from the river basin and pointed out that the implementation of these works in South Australia provided the most economical method of achieving a substantial improvement in water quality in South Australia. I appreciate the advice I have received from the Minister for Agriculture in respect of the activities of the working party which is investigating problems of salinity in the Murray. But further to that information I now ask the Minister who represents <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Berinson</inline> in this place to ensure that urgent consideration is given to the removal of these evaporation ponds in the Murray Basin to which I have just referred. </para>

            <para>- The problem of private wool buying has been evident in Australia for some years now. It has become a problem since the introduction of the floor price scheme which is currently operating in the auction room in Australia. The Government has given a lot of thought to this matter in conjunction with the industry. There is conflicting evidence, some to show that the private buying system is undermining the auction system and other evidence to suggest that it is not. The principal reason that the Government has not acted to restrict the activity of private buying is that it believes the wool grower has the right to have an option as to whether or not he sells his wool through a private buyer or through the auction system. However, if evidence does show- I think the evidence may be increasing- that the operations of the private buyers are having an undermining effect on the operation of the floor price scheme, the Government will be obliged to take up the matter with the industry with a view to seeing what might be done to ensure the stability of the floor price system. </para>

            <para>-The 2 matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mcintosh</inline> in his question indicate a case of the critics confounding one another, as I suggest that both of the allegations could not be true. Indeed, I suggest that neither of them is true. As regards the Tribunal&#39;s effect on prices, yesterday I tabled in the Senate the annual report of the Prices Justification Tribunal. The figures set out in that report clearly show that, if the Tribunal had not existed, in at least 7500 cases last financial year companies would have been free to increase prices without having to justify their actions and in many instances without significant competitive restraints. The annual report of the Tribunal shows that of the 7500 price proposals that were received by the Tribunal last financial year, more than 16 per cent were reduced or withdrawn altogether. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In addition, I think that if the honourable senator peruses the report he will see that about 700 complaints that suppliers had increased their prices were referred to the Tribunal either from members of the public or on advice from prescribed companies. Whilst it is true that the Tribunal says that because of lack of sufficient evidence a large number of these cases could not be followed through nonetheless in about 60-odd cases the prices were reduced as a result of the Tribunal&#39;s investigations. In some cases the lower prices were accompanied by refunds to consumers. I suggest that the effectiveness of the Prices Justification Tribunal in keeping prices at a fair and competitive pace is beyond doubt. </para>

I ask the Minister whether it is a fact that the Industries Assistances Commission and its predecessor, the Tariff Board, have been inquiring into the aluminium industry for some time. Could the Minister advise whether a final report on this industry has yet been received from the Commission and, if so, when it will be publicly released? </para>

            <para>-The honourable senator might know that the Industries Assistance Commission, and before it the Tariff Board, have had under study 3 references on the aluminium industry dated 1969, 1971 and 1973, and I understand that printed copies of the Commission&#39;s final report will be available within the course of the next few days. When the report becomes available I will be tabling and releasing it, not only for the Parliament but also for general distribution. The honourable senator might be aware that the Commission regards this report as being a highly significant one because it is the first major report which has been prepared by the Commission on the basis of the draft report procedure which was introduced earlier this year. In other words, the Commission drew up certain draft conclusions, presented them to the industry for consideration or comment, and as a result of that consideration and comment the Commission has now prepared the final report. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The draft report procedure, as I have said before, is an extremely desirable development and one which I hope the Industries Assistance Commission will give consideration to applying in the future to all, or if not all to most, cases or reports dealing with long term assistance matters. I expect to be discussing this matter with the  Chairman  of the Industries Assistance Commission the week after next, upon my return from Nauru. Whilst the honourable senator makes inquiries about the aluminium industry, I noted that the Commission released a draft report on the telecommunications equipment industry last week, which of course covers a significant sector of the electronics industry, and I hope that that industry will be offering its comments and considerations on that draft report. </para>

            <para>- There was a request from the Tasmanian Government for the purchase for the Hobart Museum of a number of items from the Craig collection which is coming up for auction. The Australian Government thought that it was a matter for the State Government. Anything of an historic nature associated with the foundation and the settlement of Australia is prohibited from being exported from Australia. That regulation will apply to anything in this collection. We have asked various people in the museum what items come under this prohibition so that we can notify prospective buyers that if they purchase such items they will not be permitted to export them from Australia. That regulation still applies, and my Department is now trying to draw up a list of the items which come under that regulation. People will not be permitted to export those items from Australia. </para>

            <para>- I have some information on the question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> asked me yesterday about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor.</inline> The Australian Embassy in Belgrade has been making approaches to the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Affairs in Yugoslavia about the arrest of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Marko</inline> Nazor since 18 June. Information about the arrest of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline> was originally given to the Embassy by his wife. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> &#39;s claims that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline> is under a death sentence and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Nazor</inline> has been imprisoned are incorrect. The most recent advice from the Australian Embassy in Belgrade is that the Yugoslavian authorities have informed the Embassy that: (a) Investigation procedures against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline> were completed on 29 September and a charge had not been brought; (b) the trial has not yet begun; it will probably be public and, if so, there would be no objection to attendance by Australian consular officials; and (c) <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Nazor</inline> had not been accused of any offence. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Embassy stressed the need for full information on the nature of the charges and reemphasised its strong desire to attend the trial. The Embassy also made strong representations for access to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor.</inline> The Australian Embassy will continue to pursue all avenues available to it to assist <inline font-weight="bold">Mr and Mrs Nazor.</inline></para>
          <para>There are one or two other points I would like to make. One is that this is not merely a problem between Australia and Yugoslavia. It is Yugoslavia&#39;s policy and therefore it applies to all countries. Its policy makes it just that more difficult to make any breakthrough in this regard. The other point I regretfully make is that from the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> handles these problems it is fairly obvious, I think, that he is more interested in exacerbating a very difficult problem between 2 countries rather than in the life and liberty of the individuals concerned. </para>

          <para>-My concern in this matter, as I related to the Senate the other day, arose from newspaper information initially. I was unaware that a man had been held in gaol incommunicado for a period of 3 months until the newspapers revealed the fact. Subsequently, I was informed of what had been related to my informant from other people that the man was under a death sentence. I sought to have that confirmed in the space of three or four hours available to me. I was unable to get that confirmation. I raised the matter on the basis as appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> to get information from the Minister as to whether or not that allegation was true. That is what the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record reveals. The Minister has sought the information and he has given the information. I assure him that I will not be intimidated into being silent when there are growing numbers of people whose imprisonment in Yugoslavia and other countries is becoming known and the inactivity of this Government is also becoming known. I hope that the Minister will be active and that he will be persistent. But I do not believe that he will achieve the results which everyone wants to have achieved by pussy-footing with a Communist government. I would hope that he would protest publicly, vigorously and persistently because it is only by shaming these governments by public exposure of what they are doing that we are likely to get results. That has not been an attitude which the Minister has been taking. </para>

          <para>This Bill is designed to implement the electoral divisions in South Australia having the names and boundaries approved in respect of that State by the House of Representatives on 21 May 1975. An identical Bill was introduced into that House on 29 May 1975 and passed the same day. lt was introduced into and rejected by this chamber on 10 June 1975. As honourable senators are aware, the report by the Distribution Commissioners for the State of South Australia was laid before both Houses of the Parliament on 15 April 1975, pursuant to section 23A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, together with suggestions, comments, and objections lodged with the Distribution Commissioners pursuant to sections 1 8A and 2 1 of that Act. A motion for the approval of the re-distribution proposed in that report was passed by the House of Representatives on 21 May 1975, but was negated by the Senate on the following day. </para>
          <para>The Electoral Re-distribution (South Australia) Bill is one of five Bills designed to implement the Distribution Commissioners&#39; proposed electoral divisions for South Australia, Tasmania, Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. These Bills are necessary because of the uncompromising attitude adopted by the Opposition parties towards the re-distribution proposals for each of the 5 States concerned. The Government believes that the effecting of these re-distributions has become a matter of urgent necessity in order to provide equality of representation for every elector. The Government is not prepared to wait until 1977 or 1978 to effect a re-distribution, even supposing that future Distribution Commissioners could produce proposals which would please both the National Country Party and the Liberal Party. </para>

          <para>This Bill is designed to implement the electoral divisions in New South Wales having the names and boundaries approved in respect of that State by the House of Representatives on 22 May 1975. An identical Bill was introduced into and passed by that House on 29 May 1975. It was introduced into and refused a second reading by the Senate on 10 June 1975. </para>
          <para>As honourable senators are aware, the report by the Distribution Commmissioners for the State of New South Wales was laid before the House of Representatives on 13 May 1975 and before the Senate on the following day, pursuant to section 23a of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, together with suggestions, comments and objections lodged with the Distribution Commissioners pursuant to sections 18a and 21 of that Act. A motion for the approval of the redistribution proposed in that report was passed by the House of Representatives on 22 May 1975 but was negated by the Senate on 27 May 1975. </para>
          <para>For the information of honourable senators, I incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a statement showing the enrolment as at 29 August 1975, for electoral division Division in New South Wales. </para>

              <para>The knowledge of the human toxicology of mercury has been built up over hundreds of years, having been described as early as 1567. The effects of both acute and chronic mercurial poisoning were known before the Minamata and Niigata incidents. Inorganic mercury poisoning was described in a detailed study in 1935. This type of poisoning is characterised as the &#39; mad hatter&#39;s disease &#39;. </para>

          <para>Acute poisoning of human beings by organic mercury compounds was first reported in the 1920s. This was followed by reports of numerous other cases in the succeeding decades which resulted in investigations of the toxicology of organic mercury compounds in animals in the 1940s and 1950s. </para>

Browning, published in 1961, &#39;Mercury in the Environment&#39; (CRC Press), published in 1972, &#39;Health Hazards of the Human Environment&#39; (World Health Orgainzation), published in 1972, and &#39;Health Effects of Environmental Pollutants&#39;, by G.

          <para>The Japanese epidemics drew attention to methyl mercury poisoning as a public health problem and directed research towards the environmental pollution aspects. Swedish research with human volunteers indicates that there may be a degree of individual variation in sensitivity to methyl mercury, and it is known that naturally occurring levels of selenium in fish can help to reduce the toxicity of methyl mercury. A full account appears in &#39;Selenium in Biology&#39;, in Annual Review of Pharmacology, Vol. 15, published in 1972. </para>

              <para>Although my attention has not been drawn to reports from Finnish scientists, I am aware of studies by Swedish scientists, reported in Archives of Environmental Health, Vol. 25, in August 1972. These studies indicated that a relationship does exist between exposure to methyl mercury, by ingestion of fish, and blood mercury level. A correlation between blood mercury levels and levels in hair was also seen. The report stated that it appears that the assumptions concerning the levels of mercury in the blood and hair to be expected following consumption of contaminated fish are reasonably accurate. Current Swedish restrictions in fish consumption are based on these levels. What was not known with any certainty was the level of mercury in the blood and hair which correspond to the onset of clinically detectable symptoms of mercury intoxication. </para>

              <para>I am aware of a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Yamaguchi</inline> and others at the Kurume University School of Medicine in Japan, published in the United States Health Services and Medical Health Administration Health Reports in October 1 97 1 . This report recognised that fish caught in unpolluted natural waters contain a certain amount of methyl mercury. The report suggested that the amount of fish consumed significantly influences the mercury content in scalp hair, particularly the methyl mercury content. The report said that the actual effect on the health of people of alkylmercury from fish caught in a natural environment will have to be examined in detailed intensive studies. lt is known that studies in Sweden in 197 1 and Finland in 1969 did not reveal any cases of clinical methyl mercury poisoning resulting from fish consumption, despite the high blood mercury and hair mercury levels in some cases. Swedish workers indicate that this is related to individual variations in sensitivity to mercury poisoning. This was reported by Skerfving in Food and Cosmetic Toxicology. Vol. 10 in 1972. </para>

              <para>The National Health and Medical Research Council has recommended that the Australian and State Departments of Health should undertake a further &#39;market basket&#39; survey along the lines of previous surveys conducted during 1970 and 1974. The survey is to ensure the continued monitoring of the residues of certain pesticides and heavy metals in selected foods which are typical of average dietary habits. </para>

          <para>Following discussion with the Australian Government Analyst, it was decided to survey cereals, meat, fish (including shellfish) eggs and offal, butter, vegetables, fruit and canned goods including juices, fruits and vegetables (some of them intended for consumption by infants), condensed and evaporated milk. Sampling, which began on 26 February 1975 will cover each State capital city on a seasonal basis, with the last purchases to be made in midOctober 1975. The items are being cooked and subsequently blended at the School of Home Science. East Sydney Technical College, while the analyses for organochlorides and heavy metals including cadmium, lead, tin, zinc, arsenic and mercury are being carried out in the laboratories of the Australian Government Analyst. </para>
          <para>The results of the 1974 survey were received in February 1975, and a detailed analysis of the results is currently taking place. A complete report will be available for the Eighty-first Session of Council in the latter part of 1 975. </para>
          <para>Such surveys, by monitoring levels of mercury and other toxic residues in food, will assist in averting any danger to the population by drawing attention to any occurrence of unusually high levels of pollutants in food, including mercury in fish. </para>
          <para>My Department is also keeping work in the international field under close attention, such as the 1972 Swedish study mentioned in (5), which was aimed at collecting some basic data needed for the evaluation of risks attending intake of fish with increased levels of methyl mercury. </para>
          <para>Since there is no effective therapy for methyl mercury poisoning, prevention, as the only means of control, must be emphasised. Such means should be directed at the maximal reduction of controllable sources of mercury emissions to the environment and the provision of adequate regulations that minimise exposure of vulnerable sub-groups, such as children and pregnant women, to mercury from fish. </para>

            <para>It would clearly be impracticable to identify every unpublished document produced by or for the Government and 1 am not prepared to aythorise the expenditure, time and effort which would be involved in attempting to do so. In my answer on 1 3 May 1 975 ( House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> p. 2198) I pointed out that my Government&#39;s record in relation to the release of information, in contrast to that of its predecessors, has been outstanding.

          <para>The answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government believes that the direct responsibility for restoring and maintaining peace in Portuguese Timor rests with the Portuguese Government. In accordance with this view, it has sought to encourage Portuguese mediation efforts and, for example, has facilitated with practical help the mission of the Portuguese special envoy, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Almeida</inline> Santos, who has been attempting to arrange discussions with the contending parties in Portuguese Timor on a cease-fire and political settlement in the territory. </para>
            <para>It is true that Portugal has indicated that it has lost control of the situation in Portuguese Timor: on 27 August the Governor of Portuguese Timor withdrew from the capital of the territory, Dili, to the off-shore island of Atauro. It is the sovereign decision of Portugal whether it should return a peace-keeping force to Portuguese Timor to re-establish order there. But there can be no doubt that Portugal has the capacity to do so. Thus in the last few weeks Portugal has been able to find additional forces to deploy in Angola and thus attempt to reassert its control in that territory. It should be equally possible for Portugal to reinforce its Portuguese Timor garrison. </para>
            <para>The view of the Australian Government remains that, as the sovereign power, the responsibility to retrieve the situation in Portuguese Timor rests with Portugal. Australia owes no duty to Portugal to exercise a delegated authority in this regard. Australia, were she to attempt to do so, would run grave risks of taking sides in the internal dispute within Portuguese Timor. </para>

            <para>Last week I directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs several questions concerning the status of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam, and I asked to which government the Australian Ambassador is to be accredited. The Minister advised that the Australian Ambassador is to be accredited to the Provisional Revolutionary Government. I now ask: Is the Minister aware of a reported statement by the Foreign Minister of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam and of North Vietnam made in Lima, where I understand the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs is at present, stating &#39;the unification of Vietnam is now accomplished and an official announcement is now only a matter of procedure?&#39; In view of this statement, is it still the Government&#39;s intention to accredit an Australian Ambassador to a non-existent government of a non-existent state? </para>

            <para>The Australian Government is aware of the report referred to, but it is unable to confirm whether it is an accurate account of any statements made in Lima by DRV and PRG representatives. </para>
            <para>The eventual reunification of North and South Vietnam is a stated policy objective of both governments. This has not yet occurred and in the interim the two governments continue to function separately. The existence of two governments is recognised by at least 75 countries. The fact of their separate functioning has general acceptance as indicated by the participation of the DRV and PRG as full and separate members of both the WHO and WMO. </para>
            <para>It is the Australian Government &#39;s intention to accredit its Ambassador to South Vietnam to the PRG as the sole government of the country. </para>
