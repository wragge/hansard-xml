              <para>-I do, as do all honourable senators on the Opposition side. I ask: Is not the Minister concerned at the dishonesty, deception and corruption of the Government as illustrated by the latest developments in the sordid overseas loans scandal? Does the Minister not agree that the Prime Minister, as the head of the Government, must take responsibility for these atrocious events? Is the Minister, like all Australians, ashamed and contemptuous of the actions of the Prime Minister a man anxious to take the credit when things go right, but the first to run for cover when things go wrong? Is he not disgusted at the way in which the Prime Minister evades his responsibility by sacking, removing or demoting his own friends and colleagues <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean, Dr Cairns, Mr Barnard, Mr Cameron, Dr Cass, Mr Cope, Mr Bryant,</inline> the then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> and now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> to name just a few. Finally I ask: As an honest and honourable man, will not the Leader of the Government in the Senate do the honest and honourable thing and refuse to serve under a Prime Minister who, to use an expression well known to members of the Australian Labor Party, rats on his mates and is interested only in saving himself? </para>

            <para>-I would think that the last person who could be described as one who would run for cover would be the Prime Minister. I suggest, with great respect, to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate that depending on what he and his colleagues may be doing over the next few days, they may well have cause to find that out in the weeks ahead. Allegations against this Government concerning the loans issue have been debated in this chamber on many occasions. I do not intend to repeat all the arguments. I wish only to make this one comment: On many occasions the Opposition has been invited to establish some credibility for its argument that anything improper or illegal has been done by this Government in respect of those matters. After all this passage of time and the inability of the Opposition or anybody else, for that matter, to produce that evidence, I suggest that the matter ought to be allowed to rest there. </para>

            <para>-The first 5 justices of the High Court of Australia were all former politicians. They were Chief Justice Griffith, Justices Barton, O&#39;Connor, Isaacs and Higgins. All but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Griffith were members of the first Federal Parliament. They decided cases on legislation which they had earlier voted on and on the Constitution which they had drafted and voted on. Justices Evatt, McTiernan, Chief Justice Latham, Chief Justice Barwick and Justice Murphy were also members of the Federal Parliament. They have sat on and decided cases on laws they helped to make in the Parliament. A former Liberal Party senator and Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Spicer, who was responsible for drafting the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and setting up the Commonwealth Industrial Court was appointed by the Liberal Government of which he was a member as the Court&#39;s first Chief Judge in 1956 and has continued from then on to pass judgment on his own legislation. No one from any side of politics has ever objected to that situation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Of the present High Court, Chief Justice Barwick and Justice Murphy were AttorneysGeneral of Australia and Justice Mason was Solicitor-General of Australia. In those capacities, each of those 3 men necessarily gave advice to their governments on the interpretation and constitutionality of numerous laws and proposed laws. If they were not to sit on matters in which they had given relevant advice to the governments then in office, very little work would have been done in the High Court. The fact is that each of them and the other justices before them were appointed to the Court, acted for numerous persons and bodies and gave advice on aspects of the Constitution and the laws which are constantly coming before the High Court. </para>
          <para>I recall that many years ago- in 1922, as a matter of fact- 2 justices of the High Court, Chief Justice Knox and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Starke, sat to determine the constitutionality issue in the actual case in which they had previously appeared as counsel. There are cases in England in which the same thing occurred. In the famous constitutional case of Marbury v. Madison, Chief Justice Marshall presided over the United States Supreme Court and ruled on the validity of events in which he had participated as Secretary of State </para>
          <para>It should be noted that in the case of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> complains each of the 7 judges held that all the procedures in section 57 of the Constitution for passing the Senate Representation Bill at the Joint Sitting were observed. That is apparent from the order of the Court. It is absurd to suggest that Justice Murphy should not rule on whether, apart from the method of its passing, the Act was constitutional. In that respect, the case was no different from the one concerning the constitutionality of any one of the hundreds of Acts which were passed during the period of each of the former advisers to the government who now sit on the High Court. The outburst by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is explained by his notorious paranoia in all matters concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy. </para>

            <para>-The first of the 12 mail centres that are to form the new network around Australia was established at Blackburn in the Melbourne metropolitan area in August last. Another centre will be opening at Geelong later this month. A further one will be opening at Ballarat in April 1976. There are plans to set up similar organisations in New South Wales and Queensland. The advantages are, of course, the greater reliability of the network in facilitating the direct interchange of mail between the centres, the flexibility in meeting variations in growth and the smaller working groups in more congenial organisations. The concept, of course, is one that derives from the recommendations of the Vernon Committee. </para>

            <para>-Yes, I have seen the article. Already a decision has been made that an aerogram depicting a biblical scene, which we think will be acceptable to the public generally, will be on sale from the end of October 1975 until 1 December at a cost of 25c. This compares more than favourably with the ordinary charge of 45c for a letter to England. It was decided not to produce the article in multiple languages because of the large number of ethnic groups in Australia and the danger of offending some of these groups. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. If the Government has done nothing illegal or improper in relation to the overseas loans matter, why is it that all the Ministers involved in the Executive Council meeting of 1 3 December last have now been removed from the Ministry with the exception of one only, the surviving Prime Minister? </para>

Did he note that the Liberal member for Bruce declined to debate this issue with the endorsed Australian Labor Party candidate for the seat of Bruce which area the newspaper covers? Is he able to provide some information on who eventually debated this subject with the Labor Party candidate? Is this further evidence of the close collaboration now taking place between the Opposition and the insurance companies in their doomed attempts to destroy the social welfare initiatives of this Government? Is there anything in the report which gives demonstrably false information about the insurance companies? </para>

            <para>-My attention has been drawn to the <inline font-style="italic">Waverly Gazette</inline> by a number of interested readers of that journal. I have seen the reports of a debate which took place. My information is that the endorsed Labor candidate for Bruce was asked to debate the issue of the Australian Government Insurance Corporation with the present member for Bruce whose name would still be familiar to some honourable senators opposite. The honourable member for Bruce declined to take part in the discussion but, in the interchangeable way which they apparently have, a senior functionary of the National Mutual Life Association represented the Life and General Insurance Committee and/or the Liberal Party in the debate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The representative of the Life and General Insurance Committee, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ferres,</inline> did misinform his audience, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Waverley Gazette,</inline> when he said that insurance companies provided about 50 per cent of all investment funds for the business community through premium income. In fact, any examination of the statistics about investment by insurance companies throughout Australia shows that that is a gross exaggeration of the kind one is becoming used to from these sources. In fact, the statistics show that life insurance companies have invested something like 14.3 per cent in the assets of financial institutions and 6.6 per cent are controlled by non-life insurance companies. It is absolute nonsense therefore to say that they are responsible for 50 per cent of the investment. I believe that this is a further instance of the collaboration between the Liberal Party and the insurance companies and the manner in which the life and other insurance offices spend their policy-holders&#39; money on appearing for the Liberal Party in campaigns of this sort. </para>

Representations were made to me in my capacity as Special Minister of State for a contribution towards the conference by the Australian Government. The matter was considered by me, by my colleague, the Federal Treasurer, and, I think from recollection, by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, those Ministers being the committee of Ministers who are responsible for handling matters of this nature. I can advise the honourable senator with pleasure that the Australian Government has approved a grant of $10,000 towards the cost of holding the conference in Sydney. </para>

That is the policy that stands, and I am quite sure that as Minister for Minerals and Energy it would not be part of my function to raise loan moneys on behalf of any of my ministerial responsibilities.

            <para>- I have seen reports that Victoria has imposed a ban on the production and sale of flammable nightwear and that New South Wales is considering the matter. My Department administers regulations which provide that imported children&#39;s nightwear shall be marked to indicate the extent of the in flammability of the material. Those regulations are in accordance with standards issued by the Standards Association of Australia. The Government cannot see the value of prohibiting the importation of children&#39;s flammable nightwear while it can be manufactured and sold in Australia under State laws. If the ban on the production and sale of flammable nightwear extends to all States then the Government certainly will stop the importation of such goods. I am having discussions with my colleague the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs on the question of introducing complete import control of this material. </para>

Did not the Secretary of the Treasury then, in the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> at page 361 1, strongly object to the inclusion of the Treasurer and did not the Prime Minister name the Minister for Minerals and Energy as the person authorised to borrow the money?

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> had been careful in his homework he would know that during the currency of this Government irrespective of authorities issued to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> by the Executive Council, the Treasurer and his predecessors have negotiated loans on behalf of the Australian Government. That is, the Treasurer has done that. Even during the currency of all the propaganda and the smokescreen raised by the Opposition over the past few months on this matter, a loan for $ 100m was negotiated by the Australian Government on the New York market, quite distinct from any loans under the authority issued to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor.</inline></para>

          <para class="block">Justice Murphy. It is especially reprehensible, coming from a lawyer and a former AttorneyGeneral. It has always been a convention, as I have understood it, that lawyers do not choose a privileged occasion to attack judges. It is certainly a cowardly act, seeing that  His  Honour is in no position to reply. I would think that it is also characterised by the sort of selectivity that I mentioned in that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> reserved his barbs for one judge but omitted mention of many others who could equally have been charged with a breach of duty or disgraceful conduct, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has said. I think that in addition to the way I categorised it earlier, which aroused the ire of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack, I would say that this action and all such actions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> are based primarily on jealousy of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy&#39;s great achievements as a legislator in this place. As to possible remedies, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> would know that his statement undoubtedly constitutes contempt of court, but I would be surprised if the judges of the High Court did not take the view that his remarks were beneath contempt. </para>

I refer to his emphatic and unqualified statement during the July debate on the overseas loans affair that all relevant information and all relevant documents had been made available to the Parliament, the Senate and the public. In view of the current revelation that a considerable volume of highly significant documents and material available then were withheld from the Parliament and the Senate and that the Senate was gravely misled on this matter, what explanation does the Leader of the Government now offer for his July statements? Does the Minister still assert, as he did then, that the then Minister for Minerals and Energy was wholly forthcoming in his statements, disclosures and documents in July? </para>

In both Houses of Parliament, Ministers accept in good faith the information and the material which is forwarded to them. I believe it is unfortunate that it has to be conceded that some material which could have been made available to the Parliament was at that time presumably not made available. </para>

Is it a fact also that we hear reports of upward trends in drug smuggling generally and particular instances of drug syndicates utilising air couriers to import drugs? Does the Minister accept that the staff of the Department of Police and Customs must be on the horns of a dilemma? On the one hand, they have to increase the rate of processing passengers and on the other hand they have to exercise more stringent controls in order to stop illicit drug importations. If this is the case, what steps has the Department taken to overcome the problem? </para>

            <para>- It is a very serious problem in view of the great increase in the number of passengers arriving in and departing from Australia by all means of transport, particularly air. The number of arrests on charges of illicitly smuggling drugs into Australia indicates an increase in smuggling. To try to co-ordinate a thorough check and an expedition of entry of passengers through customs, my Department has introduced a new system of processing at international airports. Computer services will be greatly used. The Department has introduced a new passenger statement, with a tick box system in 5 languages. It has abolished the requirement for passengers to make an oral declaration. It has introduced a quarantine channel to facilitate the entry of passengers who are bringing in luggage that may be subject to quarantine. </para>

          <para>In regard to the selection of baggage to be examined, today the Department does not examine all baggage but selects baggage which, on some information, it may be suggested is suspect and should be selected. It selects other baggage at random on a computerised basis. The incoming passenger never knows the occasion on which his bags will be subjected to a thorough check. The new system is intended to reduce the number of baggage examinations on low risk passengers but places greater emphasis on the more sophisticated detection of high risk passengers. Despite this, I think it must be accepted that some drugs are coming in with overseas passengers. We do not know how we can reduce that inflow although I think the illicit drug traffic in </para>

            <para>- There was a forced landing by a Chinook helicopter in about June at Amberley. It was severely damaged. Following the accident, an interim restriction of 100 hours flying time was placed on all engines in service, pending an investigation of the cause of the engine failure which had resulted from a failure of a bolt in the power turbine area. The cause of the failure has been resolved. The interim restriction on engines which have been inspected and cleared for normal overhauls has been lifted. There was some slight effect on squadron operations, but they have now returned to normal. </para>

In view of earlier failures associated with the use of falcons to combat seagulls at the Sydney Airport- some of the falcons went A.W.L. to Adelaide- I ask the Minister whether the new falconer and his birds will be paid only on results achieved. </para>

            <para>- I am not an expert on birds. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> asked me to obtain information about the success or otherwise of the use of falcons to combat the seagull problem. I have not been able to get any information about the question regarding Adelaide, but I am now told that currently a series of trials are being done by professional men from the United Kingdom who have had wide experience in the operation and handling of these birds at aerodromes in that country. We can never really be sure whether the use of these birds will be successful because much depends on whether the operators are amateurs or professionals. I have been told that there may be some difficulty in training the birds to adapt to our Australian conditions. The choice of birds is another factor. The birds have to be young enough to train but at the same time old enough to have had some hunting experience. The trials are expected to be completed in December this year or January next year. The information from the Department is that the use of these birds is regarded as successful in other countries, and we expect the same thing to happen in Australia. </para>

              <para>- I agree that I probably did say those words. Since I have said them I regret having said them because I did not intend the words in the way in which they were interpreted. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline> had more experience of appearing on television he would know that you do not always have the opportunity to utter the <inline font-style="italic">mot juste;</inline> that you sometimes do not choose your words as wisely as you would like. I welcome this opportunity of conceding that it was an unfortunate choice of words, and that I did not mean it in the way that it has been taken. I do not for one moment suggest that the public is not entitled to know everything about a matter about which some doubt may have been raised. </para>

            <para>-Yes, I have seen the copy of the <inline font-style="italic">AMA Gazette</inline> to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> has referred. I have seen the article to which the honourable senator refers in which the Australian Medical Association apparently advises its members not to include the provider code on the forms which they submit to the Health Insurance Commission on their stationery. For a number of reasons, including a need to see that there is accuracy in the computer assessments of Medibank claims, it is necessary to give to each doctor and other providers of services which are covered by Medibank and listed on the item fee schedule, a reference number which is referred to as the &#39;provider code&#39;. As each Medibank claim is prepared for computer processing, it is necessary to look up the provider code on a listing and then write the number on the claim. Because provider coding is causing quite long delays in the processing of claims, a number of improvements in the methods of coding are under examination. </para>

          <para>On 15 September last, nearly 22 000 letters were sent to doctors. As at 29 September, the number of favourable responses had reached only 5300. But it is still quite a substantial number of replies within such a short period from doctors who were prepared to carry out these suggestions. It has been estimated that for each doctor participating in this proposal, Medibank would save up to $340 a year in clerical costs. The doctors who have replied to this letter have displayed considerable co-operation. It is unfortunate that other doctors are not doing so. It is apparent that despite the imploring of the AMA, through its gazette, to doctors to take part in the sabotage of Medibank, the majority of doctors are patriotic citizens who do not wish to disrupt the economy of this country and who wish to see that the laws of the country are carried out effectively and are providing this information. </para>

            <para>-Did the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs see the Australian Broadcasting Commission Four Corners program at the weekend, which reported that a number of Northern Territory Aborigines had been detained on a rape and assault charge and had signed statements to this effect when in fact it was proven that the charges were specious and that the method of obtaining the statements was questionable? I ask: Is this a common police practice in the Northern Territory when dealing with Aborigines? </para>

            <para>- I saw the segment on the <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> program on Sunday. I asked my Department to obtain some information on the allegations in the segment. This information was provided just before question time. It is a telex some 6 feet long and gives some explanation from the police at Alice Springs. I have not yet had time to see the telex. The Department has promised to get it into readable form and bring it back to me this afternoon. I do not think that the suggestion was that the evidence was false. The suggestion in the segment on television was that there was an open confession by 12 people who had raped and inflicted injuries on a girl who subsequently died. The Reverend Downing pointed out that the confession could not have been of Aboriginal origin insofar as it used words that Aborigines would not know and gave information that Aborigines would not have. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The medical evidence, as suggested by the segment, was that the girl died from injuries inflicted some 4 hours before death. Of course the rape had taken place some 24 hours prior to death. Thus there had been a confession by 12 Aboriginal males to something that they could not have done. I believe also that the evidence suggested that the girl had never been raped. This shows that there is some method of detailing and presenting Aboriginal confessions which are not true. I do not know whether these are the true facts of the case. I have asked my Department as soon as possible to get the whole transcript of the evidence presented to see whether there was any travesty of justice in the method of presentation of the case. I note that the Aborigines were not convicted. The charge was dismissed. During the next fortnightly parliamentary recess I will go to Alice Springs to have discussions with the Reverend Downing and the police to see whether it is possible to get a better and more accurate system of law enforcement between the citizens, the police and the Aboriginal communities at Alice Springs. </para>

            <para>- I have seen the report referred to by the honourable senator. While I do not disagree with much of the article, I think that the particular point that the honourable senator has raised as coming from the article is based on a misconception. The Prices Justification Tribunal&#39;s approach to the retail trade is set out in chapter 3 of its last annual report. It is clear from that chapter that the Tribunal has made quite some progress with what is an extremely difficult problem of dealing with price changes that occur in the multitude of retail trade items. What the Tribunal now does is to obtain forward budgets from the major retailers dealing with their overall retail business arrangements together with budgets for certain specified merchandise categories. These budgets are then examined and must be approved by the Tribunal. However, if the Tribunal considers that lower profit margins than those that have been notified to it ought to apply, the companies have the option either to accept the Tribunal&#39;s recommendations or to have the matter examined at a public inquiry by the Tribunal. A general comment on the matter is contained on page 1 7 of the Tribunal&#39;s annual report and is as follows: </para>

I think that is some protection on this occasion. I have not been criticised for my handling of the portfolio. Therefore I do not fear reprisals in the future as a result of having a name that starts with a &#39;C.

            <para>-Yes, not only has my attention been drawn to that article but also by a coincidence I have it with me. In replying to a question of a similar nature that was asked of me last week by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> I told the Senate that there were not 300 000 people receiving unemployment benefit. Those are the unemployment statistics of the Department of Labor and Immigration, which relate to people who are seeking employment and who are not necessarily, by any means, people who are eligible to receive unemployment benefit. The number of people who are receiving unemployment benefit is considerably less than 200 000. The total number of people receiving unemployment benefit at the end of August was 1 70 927 and the total payments for those in receipt of unemployment benefit for the month of August was approximately $35m. I repeat that the level of unemployment is in no way reflected accurately by the figures that are provided by the Department of Labor and Immigration, and I say that in no way critically of my colleague or his Department. In fact, if one wishes to look at the true position- the position of those people who are unemployed in the sense that they are eligible to receive unemployment benefit- the figures that are provided by the Department of Social Security are a much more reliable guide to the total number of unemployed within the community and in fact the cost of unemployment benefit is considerably less than that which was claimed by the Murdoch Press&#39;s Sydney newspaper. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and Immigration. I refer to estimates of the number of school leavers who will attempt to join the work force at the end of the year and ask: Are the estimates regularly revised at the Minister&#39;s request? What is the present estimate? Does that vary from earlier estimates? Is there an estimate of the number who will return to school next year because they do not expect to be able to find jobs? </para>

Will he deny those rumours and indicate when the Bills to authorise the new pension rates will come into the Senate to enable the new rates to apply from 1 November? </para>

In view of the announcement at the weekend of a fall of 10c a pound butterfat in milk for manufacture and also in view of the inevitability of some considerable reduction to dairy farmers&#39; incomes due to the world build-up in stocks of dried milk powder, has the Government any plans to assist this industry in what many reports indicate is a difficult period of some magnitude? </para>

            <para>-A11 1 can say is that I had discussions with the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation and some dairy products manufacturers in Melbourne on Friday. They pointed out some of the problems arising from the fall in prices, particularly of powder, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bessell</inline> will be well aware, and the effect that this will have on the equalisation arrangements. Certain proposals were put to me and I said that I and the Treasurer would consider them. It is true that the position of interim values for those products under equalisation is not promising at present and it is possible that the dairy industry will experience quite a tight period in the months ahead. </para>

Despite the prehistoric whistles which emerged from the other side of the chamber when this question was being asked, if it turns out to be true, 1 would regard it as an outrageous discrimination and would certainly refer it to the National Committee on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation. </para>

            <para>- I claim to have been misrepresented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland in certain replies which he gave to questions asked of him as Minister representing the Attorney-General. The answers he gave related to the circumstances and purpose of what I had said relating to the conduct of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy in sitting on the High Court and giving judgment in a matter in which he had been actively involved while he was a senator. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland used the occasion for an attack, an imputation of motives and an exercise in invective which can be judged for its worth by those who know both the background of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy and the circumstances in which he was appointed. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>In the first place, the statement which I made was made publicly and outside privilege and the suggestion that it was made under privilege is unworthy of the Minister and contrary to the facts. It was a statement which was made in the exercise of the right of free speech which all citizens and persons engaged in politics possess and was warranted by the facts which I related. Those facts were set out for those who heard my final conclusion to judge for themselves. Unfortunately the Minister chose to use only those words I had used which he wanted to use, an exercise in selectivity for which he and his colleagues are renowned. </para>
        <para>Secondly, it ought to be recalled, in the light of what he said, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy had declined to sit upon the first constitutional case which the High Court heard after his appointment. In the Petroleum and Minerals Authority case the Chief Justice told the court before the hearing began that he had agreed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy&#39;s request not to participate in the case. He went on to say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It is usual for the Bench on hearing a constitutional case to be composed of all Justices available to participate in the decision. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy has indicated to me that because of his earlier association with the subject matter of the proceedings we are about to hear, he does not regard himself as available to participate in the hearing and decision of this case. I have accepted this view. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That initial attitude which was expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy was not carried through to subsequent cases of constitutional import on which he has sat, one alone of which has so far reached the point of judgment. The statement which I made ought to be looked at in the light of the statement enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> in 1 948 when he said to the High Court in a case in which he was engaged and in which he challenged the position of some of the judges that the principle ought not to be denigrated from in the slightest degree that a judge should not have any association with the subject matter of the case. There is very much in the history of the High Court to the same effect. </para>
        <para>The Minister&#39;s reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Adrian</inline> Knox and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Starke I think completely misrepresents the actual statement which those judges made in which they explained why, having regard to a provision that there should be at least 3 justices concurring in any constitutional case, they had to sit. These are matters, I know, which might be regarded as embarking upon a debating of the issue, and I therefore forbear from referring to other authorities of which there is a great number. All I desired to say by way of personal explanation was that the imputations of the Minister were ill-founded, that there was a very solid and basic ground for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy not sitting, and he should not have sat. I repeat under privilege what I said outside privilege, and that is that it was disgraceful conduct. My motivation in this was a concern for the standing of the judiciary, the upholding of judicial standards and acceptance of the law and the courts and the decisions of the courts throughout the community. That is a theme on which I have spoken on countless occasions, as I am sure the Minister well knows. If there are bad appointments of partisan politicians and highly controversial figures there is a risk of the standing of the law and of the courts being jeopardised. </para>

            <para>- I submit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has sought in vain to distinguish the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy from that of other distinguished judges whom 1 cited in my reply to the question I was asked earlier and who saw no conflict, no breach of judicial duty, in having advised governments and then having sat as judges in interpreting cases based on Acts on which they had advised governments. In fact, I cited the case of Chief Judge Spicer of the Australian Industrial Court who played a leading role in framing the statute which set up that Court and who has constantly sat since 1956 interpreting disputes based on the Act of which he was more or less the founding father. The case which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has cited of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy requesting the Chief Justice that he should not sit on one of the earlier cases that came before the High Court concerning the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill, I suggest, is very persuasive evidence of the seriousness with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy approaches his duties and the etiquette of the Court. The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> cites it is, I think, some refutation of the attitude which he has taken towards <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has chosen to refer to the case which I cited that of Chief Justice Knox and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Starke, sitting in a case in which they had actually been counsel I think I should set at rest any doubts that the Senate might entertain as to what sort of precedent is established by this case. </para>

            <para>-If there is to be misrepresentation, let me have an opportunity to clear it up. It has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> that it is outrageous for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy to sit on a court in which a matter is before that court concerning an Act on which he may have advised. The case to which I am about to refer was, one would think, according to the principles enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> a much more grievous breach of legal etiquette in that 2 of the judges involved had actually participated in the litigation. The case is reported in Vol. 31,CommonwealthLaw Reports, page 42 1, and the passage I cite appears at page 456, where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Starke stated: </para>

        <para class="block">That was Chief Justice Knox-  and I, when at the Bar, had been counsel for opposite parties in this litigation, and would, in the ordinary course, have taken no part in the decision of this case. But during its discussion before the Full Court, some questions affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth arose, and it was doubtful if a decision of the case could be arrived at unless those questions were determined. The Judiciary Act 1912 . . . and the amending Act of 1920  . . provide: &#39;A Full Court consisting of less than all the Justices shall not give a decision on a question affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, unless at least three Justices concur in the decision&#39;. The Chief Justice and I thought that we could not, with due regard to our duty, decline the responsibility of adjudicating upon such questions if they actually called for decision, but we made it clear that we should take no further part in the case. </para>

          <para>- The Senate will recall that in my second reading speech delivered on 23 April 1975 I specified in some detail the need for the proposed operations of the InterState Commission. Honourable senators will be aware that the Bill for the re-establishment of the Commission has been before the Senate since that date. I wish to announce that in the light of subsequent deliberations the Government has decided to withdraw clauses 13 and 17 of the Bill. Also, following negotiations between the Honourable C. K. Jones, Minister for Transport, and the Honourable P. J. Nixon, the honourable member for Gippsland in another place, certain further amendments to the Bill have been agreed to. These amendments will be moved by the Opposition in the Senate and will be accepted by the Government. I am pleased to be able to record these developments which will lead to the reappearance of this Commission after so many years to work in the field of interstate transport. We expect the Commission to make a positive contribution to actions of this Parliament in promoting the development of this country&#39;s transport system. </para>

          <para>- Two amendments to clause 3 are standing in my name. The first one is to sub-clause ( 1 ) of clause 3 of the Bill. It seeks to leave out the definition of overseas transport. The simple reason for this is that this is a Bill dealing with an Inter-State Commission and therefore it ought to be confined to that aspect. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The second amendment seeks the deletion of sub-clause (2) of the clause. As the Minister pointed out in his second reading speech, this Bill is to be confined to transport matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> I seek your guidance on a matter of procedure. May I move both of my amendments at once? </para>

It will be recalled that the Constitution provides that the Inter-State Commission is there &#39;to execute and maintain&#39; the words of the Constitution all the provisions of the Constitution relating to interstate trade and all the federal laws that have been made in exercise of that power &#39;to execute and maintain&#39;, whatever that means. But it is a constitutional body that is not beholden to either the Commonwealth Government or the State Government and is therefore the only body in the Constitution of an executive nature that has a power to override divisions between a State and the Commonwealth. It derives authority from the Constitution and is therefore not bedevilled by the continuing disputation and division of a State and the Commonwealth. There is no need for agreement between the legislatures of a State and the Commonwealth. Therefore if the body is to be set up with that power it can be of particular benefit to one region of the Commonwealth that has been sorely bereft of any efficiency in services of transport hitherto, particularly maritime services. As we are divided by a strait, we are bedevilled, most unfortunately, by the monopolies that the maritime unions have secured with regard to Australian shipping. The purpose of my amendment, going to paragraph (a) of it, is to insert a clause in accordance with the type script. Paragraph (a) reads: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It shall be the duty of the Commission to maintain and execute all laws of the Commonwealth for the carrying on of stevedoring and shipping for carriage of cargo and passengers interstate and particularly between Tasmania (including dependent islands) - and, I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> there are 2 islands dear to your interest, Flinders Island and King Island- and other States. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Honourable senators may laugh. We are entitled to reveal the fact that we have an intelligent perception of the origins of the Chairman&#39;s interest. If we establish that duty in the Commission it would be a good thing. Paragraph ( b) reads: </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>The Commission shall ensure that all such services are carried on regularly according to schedules and time-tables which shall be predetermined by the Commission so as to ensure regular and efficient and economic shipping and stevedoring operations; </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">I do not think I need to explain that. Those who live in Tasmania would know that it is necessary to reassert that self-evident proposition. A great deal of our freight that should come by ship comes by air at inordinate expense rather than have the cargo undergo the monopoly control of shipping operations that have been committed to other quarters. Paragraph (c) follows, and here perhaps is where there is need for thought on the part of those who would wish to consider it. It reads: </para>
        <list type="lowerroman">
          <item label="(c)">
            <para>(i) The Commission may at any time declare that the regular carrying on of such services is urgent; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(ii)">
            <para>During a period of 60 days after such declaration it shall be unlawful for any person, company or union to take part in any strike or lockout interrupting such services; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(iii)">
            <para>Any part in breach of the foregoing paragraph shall be liable to a penalty of $500 for any person and $10,000 for any company or union for every day for which such breach continues and shall also be liable to pay compensation for any damage caused by such strike or lockout. </para>

            <para>-No will; no heart. Until we press them where do we get action? Just as a passing reference if we had not pressed the overseas loan affair today where would we have got action? What I am asserting here is not for decision tonight, and this has been arranged. Therefore I am putting it over unmistakably so that those who are in the chamber will get the full sense of the drive of this amendment. It is to establish some authority in government and I have chosen the Inter-State Commission as the agency which will owe its authority to neither government if this legislation is passed but will owe its authority and origin to the Constitution and, therefore, will override State and Commonwealth governments. </para>

            <para>- Nonsense. Those people who are the pawns or the prawns of the trade union movement would be the ones who would say that it is jackboot legislation. It is no more jackboot legislation on the workers than it is on Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd or William Holyman and Sons Pty Ltd or the Union Steam Ship Co. or anybody else who locks out the trade. I have left it in my patience for fully 10 years, ashamed of the spectacle where the Tasmanian Government pretends to the Tasmanian people that it is out to get regular shipping services and it goes cap in hand to the unions on every occasion of trouble saying: &#39;Please exempt Tasmania from the impact of your strike&#39;. Of course, the union bosses just say: &#39;Come and have a . drink. Forget it old man, it is the union that must prevail &#39;. </para>

        <para>The intendment of my amendment is that if the Inter-State Commission is established it shall be established as a potent force with particular benefit to Tasmania, saddled with a duty to guarantee efficient and regular shipping and transport services to Tasmania under the sanction that if this is not complied with there shall be a penalty and, more importantly, civil compensation for breach if the orders of the Commission are not carried out. This Commission will have the authority to examine shipping freights and the economy of them. It also will have the authority to examine stevedoring costs and their economy and then, having established freights and timetables, will have the authority to enjoin compliance. If there is non-compliance the law will give a right to anybody- and there are many importers and exporters in Tasmania who will be the victims of a breach of that right- to compensation for damage. I hope that the Committee of the Whole will consider this as a pioneering development attached to a new concept of the Inter-State Commission and try it out for an island State that has been beleagured and bedamned up to date for the want of such legislation. </para>

            <para>- It must be extraordinary, surely, for the honourable senator to seek to defend in this place what I consider to be a breach of a very sensible arrangement made between the Opposition and the Government. Honourable senators have heard me allude to the report which refers to the fact that on 23 April we brought down a Bill and we agreed that the Opposition should consider it. We provided a vehicle by which it could set out its own views, and we reached agreement. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> proposes is a Lone Ranger action, which is a most reactionary proposition. In the first place, it conflicts with what the Opposition agreed upon with the Government. That is the first point. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator is involved as a member of the Opposition. I am surprised that the honourable senator should talk in that way because I know that generally he agrees with arrangements which have been made. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> well knows, those arrangements have been made, and I came into the Senate thinking that in fact we had reached agreement. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> proposes conflicts entirely with the arrangements which his own Party agreed upon, because we have dropped out of clause 16 (2) the sort of powers which he now wants to be put into the Bill. </para>

        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline>moved those amendments. I do not want to debate them; I simply want to say that that is the fact of life. I wish to refer briefly to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has put up. I agree that because of the short notice that we have had of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> amendment it would be wise to defer consideration of this matter until tomorrow. The Government would like consideration of this Bill to proceed tomorrow, and I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has so agreed. </para>
        <para>As regards <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> amendment, he has imported into this debate a proposition which has been dismissed by his own Party. That is the first point. It conflicts with the agreement which was reached. Secondly, it seems to me that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> proposes to do is quite contrary to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which provides that any disputes that might occur in industry ought to be properly arbitrated, ought to be a matter of conciliation and judgment by the Court which the Parliament has set up to judge and adjudicate on these matters. A declaration in the terms which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> proposes is not only inconsistent with the Conciliation and Arbitration Act but also is quite an extraordinary move towards the sort of powers which the Parliament so far has not agreed to give to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </para>
        <para>Finally, and basically, the main reason I am opposed to the amendment is that I would have hoped that the consideration which the Opposition parties had given to it would be properly expressed in the Senate tonight and that it might have allowed to proceed the amendments which I said were mutually agreed upon. It may be that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is right in saying that despite that fact any honourable senator can move such an amendment. In winding up I simply say that I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> is prepared to accept the proposition that we defer consideration of this clause and that we take up the matter again tomorrow. That will allow both parties to consider, in a more definite form in my own case, the position that has been put forward tonight and, in the case of the Opposition, what it might want to make of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> amendment. </para>

            <para>-Do not get excited. I think it is fair to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> in the second reading debate foreshadowed an amendment along the lines which he has moved. The fact that the Opposition might have a view and the Government might have a view is one thing, but I will certainly not take away the individual rights of individual senators in this place. Any honourable senator is entitled, in my opinion, to move at any time his own amendment on any matter which is before the Chair. Whether or not he obtains the support of his colleagues is another matter. He must argue to obtain that support. For anyone to imply that merely because the Government and the Opposition have arrived at a certain view automatically takes away the right of any person sitting on either side of the chamber to act as a senator really debases the office of a senator. After all, I sit here as a senator. I may sit here wearing other hats, but I have been elected and sworn in as a senator for my State, and nobody is going to take that away from me, be it the Government or my own Party. </para>

            <para>- When I rose to speak on this Bill last Wednesday evening I stated that I had not intended to enter into the debate but did so because of the scurrilous attack which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> launched on 1 October upon the Government and the officials of the Department of the Treasury who had prepared the Budget figures. In the short time that I have been here I, like all other honourable senators, have suffered many harangues by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick. Senator Carrick</inline> seems to regard himself as sort of orator whereas he has much more in common with a third-rate demagogue. He possesses many of the superficial attributes but little of the charisma of Adolf Schickelgruber. But the scurrilous allegations and innuendoes which were contained in his speech in the Senate on 1 October set a new low, even for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick.</inline> They were concocted from false assumptions and faulty reasoning, compounded by arithmetic errors and propped up at the fringes by outright untruths. That sort of address is, of course, standard fare for many of the political primitives who represent the National Country Party of Australia in this Parliament, especially on economic matters. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> who, I note according to the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Handbook,</inline> has had some training in these matters, should and presumably does know better than to expound the nonsense and indeed the scurrilous nonsense that he was propounding on 1 October. </para>

              <para>- The subject matter was introduced by your colleague. If I were an Opposition senator and I had either voted for the present Leader of the Opposition or was supporting the present Leader of the Opposition, I would be very wary of delving too deeply into the subject of whether the publiclygiven assurances of certain leading politicians can be accepted at their face value. The reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> launched this scurrilous attack on 1 October is, of course, transparently clear. It was part of a continuing campaign being conducted by the Opposition and master-minded by the present Leader of the Opposition to scratch around with their fingernails in an attempt to find what he calls reprehensible circumstances&#39; to justify rejecting the Appropriation Bills and plunging this country into a constitutional crisis. The Opposition has attempted to do this on issue after issue, perhaps the most pathetic attempt being the attempt early in September to resurrect a 5 weekold letter from the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> the substance of which had been published 5 weeks before. That was pathetic. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Then there was the completely unsuccessful attempt to make a major issue of the ACTU-Solo oil transaction, particularly by the Leader of the National Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">((Mr Anthony).</inline> Indeed, even after a royal commission has found that the Government had no knowledge that this deal was being made, the Leader of the National Country Party persists with his reprehensible attitude and attempts to smear the royal commissioner and cast doubts upon his findings. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has attempted to defame and smear no fewer than 4 judges of the High Court who brought down a ruling which is politically inconvenient to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and his Party. </para>
          <para>The central feature of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> &#39;s attempt to discourage the Budget estimates was an allegation that absolutely no allowance had been made for the likely increases in salaries during the financial year. He postulated firstly: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. salaries shown throughout the Budget Estimates are calculated on March 1975 levels, before the national wage case and making no allowance whatsoever for the 23 per cent salary rises foreshadowed in the Budget Speech . . . </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The figure foreshadowed in the Budget Speech incidentally was 22 per cent and not 23 per cent as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> stated. That is a minor error. It is not true that no allowance was made for salary increases nor is it true that they were calculated simply on March 1975 salary levels. For further enlightenment on that subject I refer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> or anyone else who is interested, to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of Senate Estimates Committee A of 9 October, pages 544 and 545. I refer honourable senators particularly to the bottom of column 1 of page 545. </para>

              <para>- I might just explain that I was quoting from page 878 of the Senate Hansard of 1 October. I correctly quoted what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> said. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> was in fact quoting from Estimates Committee D <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> he did not make that clear. He said: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>My third question is: Is it a fact, as evidenced in answers provided to Estimates Committee D on 1 1 September- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I quoted from there on. If he was quoting from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of Estimates Committee D, he certainly did not say so. I return to the subject matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> then postulated that the Government&#39;s wages bill would increase by 23 per cent. He then took a very substantial broad jump and implied- I stress that he implied; he did not state explicitly- that an inflation factor at the rate of 23 per cent would have to be applied to all Government expenditure. </para>
          <para>I deal now with his reasoning. I disregard the small error in the percentage he quoted and the fact that he disregarded or was unaware of the updating by the Treasury of salary estimates as a result of the national wage case in May. That is shown in the Estimates Committee A <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> In fact, the estimates which were finally used were based on wage levels prevailing at the end of June. The much more significant conceptual error which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> made was his assumption that if wages increased by 20 per cent during the year and the Estimates had been based on the level of wages prevailing at the end of June, the Government&#39;s wages bill would increase by 20 per cent over the entire year. It ought to be apparent to anyone who stops to think for a moment about the matter- they would know that wage increases are usually at a uniform rate througout the year- that the increase will not be the increase from year&#39;s end to year&#39;s end but about half that because it will be averaged throughout the year. So <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> took a factor that was based on a couple of small false assumptions- it was twice as high as it ought to have been- and applied it to all Government expenditure instead of applying it only to the item to which it was applicable, namely wages and salaries, which comprises about 1 1 per cent of total Government Budget expenditure. By this little exercise, either in bad arithmetic or trickery, he was able to come up with a certain conclusion. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We need to know whether the deficit is to remain at $2, 798m, or whether it is on its way to doubling and, if so, creating the absolute disaster that the Government says will happen if the Budget deficit gets to the order of $4,000m or $5, 000m. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">A little later, with a bit more sleight of hand, he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Yet, here is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean</inline> saying that we are well on our way to doubling the deficit which the Government believes is disastrous. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He apparently implied that the possible or likely final size of the deficit would be about $8,000m or $ 10,000m. I thought that in that speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> had gone about as far as he would dare go in the area of misrepresentation. I was subsequently informed that he went further, outside this Parliament, when he rang the editor of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and put before the editor of that newspaper a proposition that went like this: The Budget documents are shonky. The deficit has been grossly underestimated. </para>

              <para>- Demented. Needless to say, the editor of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> treated <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> &#39;s accusations with the contempt that they deserve. In addition to the gross error in the initial inflator which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> usedusing an inflator about twice as high as it should have been and applying it to a principal nearly ten times as high as it should have been- he recognised that an allowance of $I50m was specifically provided for salary increases during the year. The item can be found on page 27 of Budget Paper No. 4. He did not say that there were two other items not specifically allocated to a function in the Budget Papers which could be used to cover salary increases or any other expenditure. I refer to the 2 Advances to the Treasurer amounting in total to $270m. He completely ignored the fact that Government cash transfer payments, principally payments to the States and payments for benefits to persons, mainly social welfare benefits payments, amount in total to $ 14,000m, which is more than twothirds of government expenditure. They are not susceptible to increases in wages or in the price of materials. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>It has become apparent since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> launched this tirade that the Budget deficit could be somewhat greater than the $2,800m which the Treasurer&#39;s estimates had shown. However, the reason for this increase is not that expenditure has been under-estimated, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> alleged, but that revenue may have been over-estimated. The reason why revenue may have been over-estimated is quite simple. Wages appear to be accelerating at a lower rate than the Treasurer and /or the Treasury had anticipated. </para>
          <para class="block">Therefore, Government revenue via taxation has declined accordingly and more than proportionally, as always happens, when personal income is lower than anticipated. So the deficit could be higher, but it will be for a reason opposite to that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> postulated. If the Opposition wants to make a federal case out of that issue, I wonder on what ground it would base its objection. Is the Opposition saying that it is deplorable or reprehensible that wages are not increasing at a faster rate than some pessimistic forecasts had anticipated? If that is the case, what is the Opposition&#39;s remedy? Does the Opposition suggest that the Government should embark on a policy of increasing wages and, thereby, the consumer price index at a higher rate? If the Opposition wishes to criticise the Government on this ground it is under a considerable obligation to show from which source it would find the extra revenue. </para>
          <para>I emphasise that the Leader of the Opposition, on behalf of the Opposition, has already endorsed the size of the Budget deficit. He has put his personal imprimatur on the deficit and has committed his Party to it as a deficit which is appropriate in the current circumstances. He has criticised some items on both the revenue and expenditure sides, but he has stated that the deficit is appropriate. If Opposition senators are as worried as they claim to be about the prospect of the deficit rising to a higher level, I assume that they will strenuously oppose all proposals to increase Government expenditure or to spend money in areas which are not explicitly provided in the Budget estimates. If that is so, I anticipate that the Opposition will oppose the adoption of the Industries Assistance Commission report on the beef industry, for example, because the adoption of that report in full would entail a reduction on the revenue side and an increase on the expenditure side amounting in aggregate to $60m to $70m for the current year. If the Opposition is going to continue to press the argument that under no circumstances must the deficit be allowed to increase through increased expenditure, it must oppose that IAC report and if it is going to oppose the IAC report I hope that the National Country Party members of the Opposition will go out among their electors and tell them that the National Country Party is opposed to that IAC report. Alternatively, the Opposition can desist from this line which it has been following for the last 3 weeks, or it can come up with a proposal which will increase government revenue to the extent necessary to offset expenditure under the IAC report. </para>
          <para>I return to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> said. He referredin fact, he was quoting an answer from the Government- to the forecast increase of about 20 per cent in the money supply, that is M3, for the year ended June 1 976. He went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>If indeed what I have said is taking place, then the rate of growth of money supply will be enormous. </para>

            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">One must conclude from that statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> regards an increase of the order of 20 per cent in the money supply as being dis.astrous, which begs the question: Where was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> when the previous Government, of which he was a back bench supporter, took the decisions which led to the money supply increasing at an annual rate of 34 per cent in the last quarter of 1973? Where was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> when the previous Government took that thoroughly reprehensible decision against the advice of the Treasury, of the Reserve Bank and of anyone who had more than a passing interest in the subject, and refused to revalue the Australian dollar in December 1971? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> wishes to suggest that an increase of the magnitude of 20 per cent in the money supply is disastrous, it is fair to ask him where he was in 1972 when the Government of which he was a supporter allowed the money supply to increase at an annual rate of 34 per cent- I might add, in economic circumstances somewhat different from those which prevail now and in circumstances which made it even more reprehensible to take that decision? </para>

              <para>- I really could not draw any firm conclusions from this particular section of his speech- referred to the alternative means of financing the deficit. He referred to whether it should be financed by treasury bill which many Liberals, including a former Liberal Treasurer, seem to think is a shonky device which has been invented by this Government when in fact treasury bill financing has been used by almost every government in the Western world ever since Lord Keynes showed them how to do it and why. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> went on to discuss the 3 alternative means of financing the deficit. He referred to doing it by overseas borrowings which he implied, correctly, would be inflationary. The Liberal Party should know that because the amount of $ 1 ,900m which it allowed to be imported into Australia in 1972 because it refused to revalue the Australian dollar was the prime cause of the inflation that hit Australia in the next 12 to 18 months. So the Liberals should be authorities on how dangerous it is to allow $2 billion in hot money to flow into the country in 12 months. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> said that was one way of financing the deficit and that it would be inflationary- full marks to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick.</inline></para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline>said that another way of financing the deficit would be to indulge on a large scale in treasury bill financing. That also, he stated correctly, was likely to be inflationary. Now, the third way of financing the deficit is by loans raised domestically. Whilst there may be some dispute about this at the fringes between the professionals in this area, it is generally agreed that that method of financing a budget deficit is not inflationary, and in the August loan the Government raised some $68 lm in this way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> referred to this fact and then stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Of those loans 50 per cent or more was subscribed by the banks. Everybody knows that the banks, facing a call up through statutory reserve deposits, would prefer to go into the bond market than simply have their money called up at minimal interest rates. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There is no objection to that statement; it seems to make sense. Then some 2 paragraphs further on in his speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>What the Government is getting is subscriptions forced from the banking institutions . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He postulated another conspiracy theory. He postulated that the Government was holding the weapon of an increase in the statutory reserve deposits over the banks and saying in effect: &#39;Unless you subscribe to our loan we will increase your statutory reserve deposits&#39;. If there was any validity in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> &#39;s conspiracy theory I wonder why a day or two after he made that statement the Government in fact allowed the statutory reserve deposits to increase? The <inline font-style="italic">National Times</inline> of the weekend before last referred to this and drew the fairly obvious conclusion that by increasing the statutory reserve deposits the Government was likely to make it somewhat more difficult to attract money from the banking system into government loans. The <inline font-style="italic">National Times</inline> quite explicitly made the point that it was obvious that this decision was being taken by the Reserve Bank, by the monetary authorities, on purely technical economic grounds without reference to or consideration of the political considerations. So another of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> &#39;s conspiracy theories or monstrous allegations and innuendoes bites the dust. </para>
          <para>It is possible that the Government will use all of these 3 means of financing the deficit in varying amounts, and it is not possible at this stage- a point which the Treasurer has attempted to put across to the economic primitives in the Oppositionto make any sort of accurate forecast as to how the deficit will be funded because that entails making forecasts about the level of liquidity and the response to public loan raisings up to 8 months hence, and that just cannot be forecast with any accuracy. The primary reason why the banking system has subscribed very heavily to government 10:ns is of course that the banks are holding a great deal of money. Oddly enough, in a period of fairly high inflation the public&#39;s propensity to hold money seems to be at least holding or perhaps even increasing. As a result of this the money supply, the Ml, which was $7.6 billion in December of last year had increased by August to $8.8 billion. The money supply, which is defined as M3, in the same period has increased from $26.5 billion to $30.5 billion. It is obvious that the public is putting more money in the banks. While that happens and while the banks continue to put that money into government loans, it does not make any real difference, so far as its effect on the financing of the deficit, the level of the money supply or inflation is concerned, whether that money comes from the public into government loans through the banking system or whether it comes directly into government loans. One of the inaccurate statements which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> used to support his shonky argument is a statement which is frequently made by members of the Opposition and picked up by the more uncritical sections of the Press, especially the rural Press concerned reinflation. Referring to higher interest rates, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This will trigger hyperinflation not seen in the history of Australia before- and this Government already holds the record. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Since that statement is so frequently made by members of the Opposition I think that the record should be put right. The highest rate of inflation ever recorded in Australia on an annual basis was for the year ended December 1951. The rate was 25.1 per cent. The highest annual rate recorded in recent times is 17.9 per cent recorded in March 1975. Just to fill in the record completely, a Liberal-Country Party Government was in power in December 1971 and had been for 2 years when we had record inflation of 25. 1 per cent over the preceding year. If we were to look at it on a quarterly basis, we would find that in the June and December quarters of 1 95 1 , the inflation rate- I am using the term &#39;inflation rate&#39; as synonymous with the consumer price index or series C index of 1 95 1 -was 6.9 per cent. The highest quarterly rate of inflation recorded recently was 5.1 per cent in September of 1974. But I dare say that neither the facts, the rules of arithmetic, nor the parliamentary conventions which have governed Australia or which have regulated the political system in Australia for the last 70 years will deter the Opposition from circulating untrue statements, from attempting to establish what they call the reprehensible grounds which they are searching desperately to find to plunge this country into a constitutional crisis. The depths to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony, Mr Fraser</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> have sunk over the ACTUSolo transactions, over the innocuous letter from the Treasurer to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> in August this year and the depths to which they have sunk in attempting to use those issues and pretend that they provide reprehensible circumstances, and the depths to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> sank when he delivered this scurrilous outburst in the Senate on 1 October and above all, the depths to which he descended when he rang the Editor of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> establish that apparently nothing is too reprehensible for members of the Opposition in this Parliament to contemplate if it helps them to secure their political objectives. </para>

If catharsis is said to be good for paranoid and disturbed people, then so be it. Many of us here feel genuine sorrow for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh,</inline> for his bitter negativism, for the uniform mediocrity of his contributions in this place, for his paranoia towards the National Country Party, for the meanness of mind and for the obvious unhappiness he brings to the chamber. I think he is likely to be no more successful here than he was as a farmer.  His  attack on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> tonight has probably been beneficial. It has probably made <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> feel important. It has probably made him feel fulfilled and perhaps it has rid him of some of his worst aggressive tendencies.

But it was only when we came to examine this Bill, when we came to look at what it was proposing, that its ramifications became obvious to us. The further one goes in the examination of this Bill, the more and more interesting it becomes. Of course it deals with loans- loans by a government caught already in the mire of corruption. Its loans activities are responsible already for the disgrace and dismissal of a Treasurer and  Deputy  Prime Minister, for the demise of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron</inline> and now for the disgrace and removal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor.</inline></para>

This question of loans is no routine matter. It is at the very heart of this Government&#39;s incompetence and dishonesty. We are in duty bound to examine this Bill closely as to what it seeks, what it is likely to achieve and the kind of price we are likely to pay for it. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Minister&#39;s second reading speech set out the purpose of the Bill- the funding of the deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The figures set out in paper No. 4 which accompanied the Budget illustrate to us that the estimated total expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund will be $20,203,436,000. Total receipts of the Fund will be $19,051,313,000 which will leave a difference, that is to say a deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which will have to be funded in some way. This Bill seeks to provide that funding. It is to be funded by a charge on the Loan Fund. The amount is described in a footnote to the table on page 10 of Budget paper No. 4 as &#39;a residual balancing item&#39;. That is the point that is interesting because the Bill, as it is drawn up, provides that the amount that can be raised by way of loan can vary depending upon the size of the residual balancing item that is required. The amount will be only the amount which the Government has stated if the receipts in the Consolidated Revenue Fund are as the Government has stated. I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy</inline> President: What is ever as this Government has stated? It will be the right balancing item only if the expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund is as the Government has stated. Again, I ask: Where in this Government&#39;s record is any evidence that things are ever what the Government says they are. </para>
          <para>The amount sought under this Bill from the Loan Fund will be used, as it were, to reduce the expenditure side of the Consolidated Revenue Fund by transferring part of defence expenditure to the Loan Fund. The amount sought for expenditure on defence at present is $ 1 ,790m although it could rise if the Government sought extra defence appropriations in the supplementary appropriation Bills next year. The plan at present is for the Government to transfer $1,152,123,000 of defence expenditure to the Loan Fund by means of this Loan Bill. But there is nothing fixed about these estimates for the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The receipts are expected to be $ 19,000m. But these can vary. We already have evidence from the present Treasurer that they are likely to vary. He has already given an indication that revenue from pay-as-you-earn taxation collections is likely to be less than was estimated and that the expenditure is likely to be greater than that set out. In fact, the Bill authorises any amount of transfer- any amount of loan raising under this Bill for the gap- provided it does not exceed the total amount set down for expenditure on defence. Of course, this manoeuvre is possible because clause 3(8) of the financial agreement allows the Government to borrow for defence purposes without seeking the approval of the Loan Council. The whole purpose of this manoeuvre is for the Government to fund the deficit in its Consolidated Revenue account without going to the Loan Council and without involving the States which it so dislikes. </para>
          <para>Clearly, this Bill- this so-called machinery measure- represents a vital part of the Labor Budget strategy and has to be looked at in that way. It is part of the Budget and part of the consideration of the Budget. It can be understood only if we examine this Government&#39;s capacity to control its receipts, to make sure that it complies with the Estimates and to control its expenditure in line with the Estimates which we have been examining in our Senate Estimates Committees. It seems, as I have said, that already receipts in the Budget have been maximised, that expenditure has been minimised and that the Government has sought artificially to show the smallest possible deficit as a going in position for the beginning of the financial year. Our job is to examine just how far from reality this is likely to be. The Budget deficit, in fact, will be enormous. Last year&#39;s deficit, estimated originally at $570m ended up as a mammoth $2,567m, the worst Budget deficit that any of us can remember, not just by a few million dollars but by an order of magnitude. </para>
          <para>I will illustrate just how great the Budget deficit was last year. In 12 years the total deficit of the Liberal-Country Party Government was $4,253m. That represents an average deficit of $3 54m a year; no more. How does that compare with this Government&#39;s deficit? Last year, the Government made a massive and fictitious under-estimate of its deficit. We want to know whether we are facing the same situation for 1 975-76. If we also look at how the Loan Bill has been applied in previous years, we will see that under Liberal-Country Party governments our total raisings for defence purposes using the device of the Loan Fund was $ 1,062m. That represents an average of about $90m a year, compared with more than $ 1 billion which this spendthrift, reckless Government is seeking now- a government described today by one of the newspapers in the words, &#39;Government totters&#39;. How right that seems to be. It totters. Is it going? Of course, we are concerned. </para>
          <para>We are asked to approve $ 1,100m to fill the fictitious gap- a gap which we know will be greater than that with each month that passes. Of course, we are concerned and we should be concerned. It would be recreant and irresponsible of an Opposition had we passed this Bill without proper examination, without proper questioning and without proper probing. We have expressed our concern and will continue to express it by means of questions- questions asked first by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> in opening the debate for the Opposition and by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick.</inline> They were questions which were sharp enough to drive <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> almost to a paroxysm of impotent anguish. They were questions designed to elicit the real story of this Loan Bill, the real amount of the deficit, the real needs for this loan borrowing and of the magnitude of the amount of money sought. We have sought to try to understand the Government&#39;s strategy and its understanding of its own actions. </para>
          <para>Questions on the Loan Bill were raised first by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> in the House of Representatives to add to the 3 minute ministerial second reading speech given there, a 3 minute speech which was considered to be all that Parliament deserved or all that Parliament was going to receive. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> received no adequate answers to his questions. The  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean),</inline> replying on behalf of the Treasurer, did not answer him properly. It is up to the Senate, where there has been responsible review of legislation, to take a closer, calmer and deeper look at this Bill and to get the answers to the questions. My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> first asked 10 questions concerning the purposes for which these loans were wanted.

          <para>I want to carry on by examining what is going to happen as the year progresses with this Government&#39;s Budget in terms of the size of its deficit. I am concerned and have been concerned that the Budget has been grossly and deliberately understated. The receipts side of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, for example, shows all the expected increases in income. For example, the Government has shown that an extra $120m is expected from the duty on coal exports. That is an amount which is now known to be an overestimate because we all know that the Government changed its plans for the imposition of a coal export levy when the foolishness of those plans was revealed in this place. So that is an overestimate on the receipt side of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The Government has already shown that it expects to receive an extra $680m from the excise on beer, spirits and tobacco. It has also shown that it expects to receive an extra $2, 600m from pay-as-you-earn income tax. Of course, that may not be possible if half a million or more Australians have no jobs and no income and therefore no capacity to pay income tax. That is likely to be an overestimate. </para>
          <para>The expenditure side of the Consolidated Revenue Fund is equally interesting because the Government has gone to some lengths to underestimate- quite coldly and deliberatelythe magnitude of its expenses in a number of departments. I have the privilege of being a member of Estimates Committee D and have had the privilege of examining the estimates of expenditure for 3 departments in the last week or so. They are: the Department of Social Security, whose estimates the Committee examined for about 2 &#39;A days; the Department of Repatriation, which came very well prepared and whose estimates were dealt with quickly; and the Department of Health, whose estimates went through in about half a day. The estimates of the Department of Social Security were a source of considerable interest. I remind the Senate that my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> has already drawn attention in his speech to the underestimate in the salaries item shown in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1975-76 and in the Particulars of Proposed Expenditure which the Committee examined. The salaries to be paid for the people who work for the Department of Social Security are far in excess and will be far in excess of what was shown in the estimates because the Government took the figures only to the end of May. </para>
          <para>If we go to the estimates for the Health Insurance Commission- that creation of a modern  Utopia;  the Government&#39;s panacea for all ills- we find that the Government has grossly underestimated the size of its commitment to the Health Insurance Commission. I am not talking just about the money that is to be paid out for the medical or hospital side of Medibank. Let us look at the salaries. We were told that the Health Insurance Commission was to have 3500 permanent and 200 temporary employees and that the salary estimate for them was $25.5m. The new estimates, which were given in response to a question asked in this chamber on 7 October and which were confirmed in the meeting of Estimates Committee D on 7 October, indicate that the Commission now expects to have 3500 permanent and 700 temporary employees and that it is looking to a salary estimate of almost $3 lm. In one small commission in one department an extra expenditure of $6m is involved. Receipts are maximised and expenditure is minimised; that is the Government&#39;s trick. Let us look at the allowance of $8 1 7,000 for overtime. The departmental officers told us quite cheerfully that that was an underestimate. Of course it is an underestimate. Overtime payments on the basis of a <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> amount per month are already running ahead of what was estimated in May. </para>
          <para>That is not where the matter ends. It is not just the $66m estimate for the salaries for the Department of Social Security that is not enough. What about the question of postage? The Department of Social Security has allowed $8.8m for postage but has not costed in the recent increases in postage rates- for example, the increase from 10c to 18c in postage for a letter. The expenditure side of the Consolidated Revenue Fund bears no relationship to the reality of today far less than to the reality of next June. There are many other examples in this Government&#39;s Estimates which have convinced us that it is grossly underestimating and that it is going to face a deficit far greater than it will admit and far greater than it had realised. I mention Medibank itself, the unknown cost of hospital and medical Medibank based on best guess estimates. The Government admits that it will have large cost increases in the next year. The only estimate the Government made of the amount it should provide for hospital Medibank was after it asked the States what their operating costs would be, divided them by two and accepted that as its share. The Government will not know the real figures until the year ends. </para>
          <para>There is no way in which the Consolidated Revenue Fund will end up with a gap as narrow as the Government has pretended and that is clear to all of us. It should be clear to everyone that the document represents another deception by a government that lives by deception. We can ask: What is the real deficit? Will it please reveal itself? Will it please stand up? Will it be $3 billion or $4 billion or $6 billion? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> told us in his Budget that if we cannot control inflation we will not control unemployment and if we cannot control the supply of money we cannot control inflation. A deficit, increasing to the levels I am suggesting it might, will carry with it inevitably enormous inflation and increasing unemployment and that is what this kind of Budget and this kind of deficit means for Australians who work for a living and who fear for their jobs. </para>
          <para>What does the Government itself have to say about the projected size of its deficit? From this morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald I learned</inline> that the Government&#39;s borrowings from the Reserve Bank have probably topped $ 1,000m, most of it obtained recently. It appears that all this massive deficit has been run up in the last month and that the Government&#39;s deficit to this moment is already somewhere over $ 1,800m. It is trying to pretend to us at the end of its first quarter that it is still aiming for a deficit for the financial year as small as $2,700m. The Government is not coming clean on this matter, the same as it did not come clean on the loans affair and the same as it has not come clean on a whole range of things from the day it took office. Perhaps it would have been better if we had been given the truth about what we face as a result of this Budget and if we were spared the kind of inanities such as when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> appears in the House of Representatives and tells us that a bigger deficit in fact will mean that things are getting better because it will mean that people are earning less and paying less tax. That is nonsense. We want a control of expenditure. We want a true statement of receipts. They are the things we want and we want to know more than we have been told. We want to know how this deficit will be funded, how this Government proposes to balance its books and how it proposes, for example, to balance the Consolidated Revenue Fund. </para>
          <para>Let me point out that if the balancing item required for the Consolidated Revenue Fund exceeds the total amount available for expenditure under the Defence appropriation this Bill will not have served its purpose. I have suggested that we are almost certainly going to see a situation where the gap to be funded is far in excess of the figure indicated. Will we have to see other loan Bills, different mechanisms? What will this Government do to balance the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to let us know what it is doing to this country? There is grave disquiet already in this country about the economic and commercial future of Australia. Every day that this Labor Government stays in office more companies fail, more people lose their jobs, inflation creeps along, unemployment gallops- </para>

              <para>- I am very grateful for your ruling and of course I will abide by it. On the front page of the Bill there is a very long clause which indicates the maximum amount which can be borrowed and that amount relates to the gap that exists between the receipts and expenditures of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. I draw that to your attention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> It is a very interesting way in which the Bill has been drawn and I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> has given me the opportunity to say a few words about it. It is interesting that the Government has seen fit to introduce the Loan Bill with no fixed amount of money indicated. It wants to borrow an indefinite amount, an amount no greater than the gap between the receipts and expenditures of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. I have spent some time developing the argument that that amount is unknown but that it is likely to be greater than the amount estimated in the Budget Papers and that for that reason we have a proper and real concern about the Bill and its functions. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">How apposite those words are today. This Government, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> has said, is the worst government in our nation&#39;s history. Its incompetence and its mismanagement in the field of employment and inflation speak for themselves. But it is also a government which is devastated by deceit and by duplicity, by deviousness and by double standards, by improprieties, illegalities and far worse. There is one area which reveals the complete double dealing, the lack of standards, and the immorality of this Government, and that is what is revealed in the report of the Royal </para>
        <para class="block">Commission on Petroleum which deals with ACTU-Solo enterprises Pty Ltd. This matter is brought into very sharp relief by the resignation today of the former Minister for Minerals and Energy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor. His</inline> resignation follows his exposure, if not for the lies he told, then for the misrepresentations and the concealments from the Prime Minister and the Parliament which were implicit in the allegations brought against him and the matters already conceded by the Prime Minister. </para>
        <para>But he was also the Minister who was involved in the implementation of an indigenous crude oil policy. It is a policy under which immense financial benefits are available to the fortunate purchasers of crude oil produced in Australia. They can obtain crude oil at $2.10 a barrel, which is four to five times cheaper than the world price for crude oil. But it is not only a policy under which the purchasers of crude oil can purchase crude oil cheaply; it is also a policy under which the producers and the sellers of crude oil see themselves receiving far less than what the oil is worth on the open world market. Accordingly, if sellers and buyers can get together and conceal the true price which they are paid or are paying then the sellers can recoup a tidy profit above what is their entitlement and the buyers can still purchase at a price which is far less than what they would have to pay if they bought in accordance with the Government&#39;s policy. </para>
        <para>The Government&#39;s policy, as it was initiated by the Gorton Government in 1969 and as it was claimed to be administered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> was not to approve sales of crude oil above the price of $2.10 a barrel. What happened, of course, under the ACTU-Solo purchase was that ACTUSolo bought for $5 a barrel and Allied Petrochemicals Pty Ltd sold for $5 a barrel. It was an agreement which was clearly contrary to the Government&#39;s policy. It was an agreement entered into on 23 May 1975 by a company of which the managing director at the time was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> J. Hawke, the Federal  President  of the Australian Labor Party, and of which another director was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> who was the secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Two other directors were involved in commercial interests. They purchased at a price which they knew at that time was contrary to the Government&#39;s policy. It meant that the company which was selling the crude oil to them was able to make a tidy profit in excess of $ 1 m. What a state of affairs it is when almost every night the Federal  President  of the Australian Labor Party appears on television castigating the multinational corporations, accusing them of fleecing and exploiting the Australian people, while at the same time he is agreeing, in defiance of his own Government- of his own Party&#39;s policy- to benefit one of those overseas companies by $ 1 m. It is an absolutely scandalous situation, and there has not been enough revelation of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and his colleagues were doing. This was a fact which was kept concealed from the Australian people. We heard all about the fact that ACTU-Solo was going into the retail selling market for petrol, and it was acclaimed as a venture by the Australian trade union movement into commerce; ordinarily a proposition I would welcome because it brings the union movement into the realities of the business world. But, of course, when it comes into the business world then the rules which apply to everyone else should apply to it. </para>
        <para>This was an arrangement the details of which were concealed from the Australian people, until suddenly on 29 August it emerged as a fact before the Royal Commission on Petroleum. The Royal Commission was examining the ways in which retailers were able to sell at discounts, and the facts of the ACTU-Solo matter suddenly emerged before the Commission. The Press picked them up and the Government was required to make some statement. It said that the matter had to be investigated, and the matter was investigated. When the transaction had been examined by the Commission, the Commission delivered a report and attributed responsibility for what was a clear breach of Government policy to the directors of ACTU-Solo for misleading the Minister. In particular, the Commission singled out <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wieland.</inline> But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> at all times protested his innocence of any deception of the Minister. He said that the Minister was not deceived. That Minister, of course, was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> since resigned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> is a man who, on my understanding of the position and on my belief, has a good reputation in the honoured sense of those words. It was not believed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> would have deliberately deceived people in the way in which the Commission found he had, and I was interested to read the actual evidence before the Commission as well as to read the Commission&#39;s findings. </para>
        <para>After one reads what was said in evidence before the Commission, after one reads what the Commission said and after one reads what the Minister said to Parliament, I think certain conclusions can be drawn. I believe that there is a very strong contention that can be made that, far from the Minister being misled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter,</inline> it was the Minister himself who led <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> to propose the course of action which was followed. </para>
        <para class="block">That contention has a high degree of probability if reliance is placed upon what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> has said. Indeed, it is a contention which derives support from the circumstances of the whole transaction and the general belief amongst so many people that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> has been made a scapegoat. In short, the true position may well be that the Government and ACTU-Solo bear in mind that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> is the leading light in ACTUSolo agreed on a joint course of action in which the Government benefited its friends and political supporters. They agreed upon a joint course of action, but when the facts were revealed the rogues fell out and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> was left to bear the burden. </para>
        <para>This contention draws even greater strength from the conduct of deception and concealment which is now patently revealed and conceded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> in connection with the Khemlani loans affair. In short, what I believe is the position from my reading in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of what has been said by the Minister, from what appears in evidence and from what the Commission has found, is that the ACTU-Solo company in effect the Labor Party company headed by the  President  of the Australian Labor Party and served also by the Secretary of the ACTU, secured the indulgent blind eye of the Government. This was more than a case of jobs for the boys. It had all the indications of impropriety in public office for the benefit of the Government&#39;s political party. If incidentally an overseas company benefited by over $lm, that of course was not something with which the Government was concerned. </para>
        <para>I propose to take a little of the time of the Senate to look to the record to bear out some of the facts which support the contention I have made. The Royal Commission found, as indeed on the evidence it had to find, that the Minister for Minerals and Energy had before him an agreement which did not reveal the true price. There had been presented to him a letter, together with an agreement, which said that all that ACTU-Solo was paying was $2.10 a barrel. That of course was a lie, because the other documents which were before the Royal Commission disclosed that the price it was paying was $5 a barrel. The Commission found that the true price - </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">It found as a conclusion that the same crude had previously been offered to nearly all the major Australian oil companies but that those companies had refused the offer on the&#34; ground that the price was $5 a barrel and that would have been contrary to the Government&#39;s policy. It found that on 23 May the option to purchase at $5 a barrel had been exercised on behalf of and for the benefit of ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd. </para>
        <para>It was found that on 1 7 June <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> had written to the Minister for Minerals and Energy enclosing an unsigned agreement in which ACTU-Solo was declaring that it purchased the crude from Allied Petrochemicals Pty Ltd for $2.10 a barrel. At approximately the same time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> said that he told the Minister by telephone that the price did not exceed $2.10 a barrel. The Commission found that these representations, both oral and in writing, were misrepresentations and they deceived the Minister as to the price being paid. It was said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter,</inline> at the time he represented the price to be $2.10, was aware that if the price had been higher the Minister would not have approved and, as a result of the misrepresentations on price, the Minister found that the transaction was unexceptional in terms of the Government&#39;s indigenous crude oil policy and communicated this view to ACTU-Solo and to the producers so that the crude could be uplifted. The Commission proceeded to find that the purchase price of $5 a barrel was divided into 2 agreements; one agreement for the $2. 10 and the other for the balance. The Commission stated, and I quote its words: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>No reasons were ever given by ACTU-Solo to account for the division of the contracted arrangements into 2 separate parts or why the consideration was apportioned. </para>

        <para class="block">I stop there. How curious when you have an agreement to buy something for $5 that you should split the arrangement into 2 parts and to offer no reason as to why you are splitting it into 2 parts. If there is some undisclosed arrangement existing beforehand that this is the way it was to be done, then one would understand it. If, in fact, the purpose of doing it in this way is to show one agreement to the Minister and to conceal the other, then of course that is the way around the Government&#39;s policy. But why was it done that way and at whose suggestion was it done? The arrangement appears so clearly from the evidence and from ;what the Minister said in Parliament - </para>

            <para>-I am coming to it. The arrangement resulted in Allied Petrochemical Company, securing a windfall profit in the tidy sum &#39; of &#34;Between $1,019,000 and $1,224,000. A further conclusion of the Commission was: 25.21 The Commission considers that the Minister has never considered the &#39; true nature of the transaction as revealed by the totality pf the documentation and that in fact that Minister has never, approved the actual transaction as between A.P.C. and ACTU-Solo in its terms, and has never had an application in terms of the true price made to him for his approval. </para>

        <para class="block">That is a  statement-  which has many qualifications in it once .you examine it. It is a curious finding in light of the fact that there was no evidence given to the Commission by the Minister. But it is not curious if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> &#39;s evidence is totally believed. In the light of what the Minister has revealed in the last few days, I would have thought there ought, to be people who will be looking at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> &#39;s evidence and wondering why he should not be believed in the light of all that has happened. </para>
        <para>The conclusion of the Commission to which I have referred is naturally to be considered in the light of the evidence placed before it. There was no evidence before the Commission suggesting that the Minister was given, to use its words, &#39;the totality of the. documentation&#39;. The only evidence was that-be-was shown the agreement which said that $2:10 per barrel was the price. On that evidence, the Commission&#39;s findings are unexceptionable. It. is a hard-hitting report with conclusions which are clear. On the evidence presented to the Commission, I would think it is compelling that there is other material apart from the evidence which was presented to it. It should be noted that certain people did not give evidence to the Commission. We are not told why. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> did not give evidence nor did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> nor did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Keltie</inline> of the ACTU research staff, nor did any of the solicitors who prepared the documentation explain why the documents were prepared to . the form in which they were. </para>
        <para>The Commission was satisfied that there were deceit and misrepresentation of the Minister; that APC was at all relevant times aware that there was an attempt to deceive the Minister; that all directors of ACTU-Solo bear responsibility for the deliberate deception; and that Messrs Souter and Wieland were the 2 directors of ACTU-Solo most concerned in the arrangement. But it is also to be noted that the Commission found that although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> was not the architect of the scheme he shares equal responsibilities with the other directors. The Commission does not- and I think this is quite unfortunate- say if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> was not the architect of the scheme who was the architect of the scheme. </para>

            <para>- Indeed, from the evidence it is not possible to say who the architect was. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> is curious to know who the architect is. With his knowledge of the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party, and with his understanding of what the Minister has been doing, I am pretty sure he knows who the architect of this scheme was. It is quite clear also from the evidence, when one links it with what the Minister said, at whom the finger points. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> is to be believed, it may well be that it was the Minister himself who was the architect of the scheme. </para>

            <para>-Let us see what happens. We were told that we were scurrilous in making the allegations about the Minister for months. We were told we were doing dreadful things in this chamber. But what happens? In due course when the facts come out the Minister cannot be justified and the Minister resigns. He thereby- concedes the duplicity of which he has been guilty for months. But there are 2 questions which the Commission does not answer. They were not strictly relevant but they are nevertheless relevant questions which now emerge. The first is: After ACTU-Solo agreed to pay $5 per barrel to obtain the crude oil, why were the 2 contract documents prepared? Why was the purchase price of $5 split and on whose suggestion was that done? Secondly, why did the Minister in the light of his knowledge as revealed by him in answers in the Parliament allow the transaction to proceed as if it were consistent with Government policy? </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Let the Senate consider what the Minister said in the Parliament. He stated that the Government did not approve of any contract by which a payment of more than $lm in excess of the Government&#39;s approval price was made. He said that the Government did not approve of that sort of thing. He said that only one agreement was submitted to the Government and that it was the only one of which the Government had knowledge. He acknowledged that he had received a telex from his Department in which it was suggested that the APC company was only receiving what it was paying for the crude oil and, in fact, it was making a loss on the deal. It would not even recover the cost of a hotly contested piece of litigation in which it had secured the rights to this crude oil as against another company which was claiming it. Notwithstanding all that expenditure, APC was selling at a loss. </para>
        <para>This was the advice given to the Minister which on the file the Minister ignored. Why? Possibly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> might be prepared to interject at this stage to offer some reason in defence of the Minister. This telex was sent on 24 June 1975. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> said that long before receiving that telex he had raised the matter verbally with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> and, as he said, &#39;They assured me no consideration was being paid other than that contained in the agreement&#39;. On the day after he said that in the Parliament <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> said that he had no doubts about the nature of the transaction. He said he knew that the APC company had been endeavouring to flog off the right to this crude for $5 per barrel. He said he knew that the APC company had offered it to every major oil company by letter and that in all cases it had been rejected. He went on to say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It was a natural thing for me immediately when approached first on the matter and before receiving any documentation specifically to raise the point that it was the same crude. I had no doubt and I insisted that it should be an orthodox transaction and nothing beyond that. It was not necessary for me to do other than to process the matter in the terms I did and in the light of the information that I received. Of course the matter was fully discussed between myself and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I received a proper assurance on it. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I stop there to interpolate that it was a great misfortune that at the time that was said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter,</inline> appearing before the Commission, had denied that he had had any such conversation with the Minister. It was rectified, of course, the day after when counsel for the Commonwealth- counsel appearing for the Minister- in a neat leading question put it to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter:</inline> &#39;Of course you had a discussion&#39; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> conveniently answered: &#39;Yes&#39;. But that is what the record reveals. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> then went on to say that he had had an assurance that the agreement which was put before him was one which conformed strictly with the policy of indigenous crude pricing. He stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Over the last 2 years I have quite consistently seen to it that policy was strictly enforced. In all cases of representation they have been told that there could be no windfall profits. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>I knew specifically that this oil had been flogged around and was continuing to be flogged around. For that reason alone, I was very emphatic that the indigenous oil price was to be the sole price paid and that was to be the final terms of that transaction. </para>

        <para class="block">The Minister said that was not what had happened and he had been misinformed. What appears so unaccountable and yet requiring explanation is how that squares with what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> has said, and how could a Minister reputed to be hard headed and, on his own words, &#39;not to be a fool&#39; ever believe that anyone would be taken in by what he had said? </para>

            <para>- On the point of order, I suggest, with great respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> that if he wishes to pursue the debate on the first reading of an Appropriation Bill, that is his right, just as any other honourable senator may speak on any matter on which he might choose to speak. This debate is on the motion that the Senate do now adjourn. That motion is distinctly opposite to the motion to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was speaking, namely, the motion for the first reading of an Appropriation Bill. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> is quite within his right in raising any matter he might care to raise on the motion that the Senate do now adjourn. </para>

            <para>- I speak to the point of order. On all past occasions on which I have heard this point of order raised it has been in relation to a substantive debate on a second reading motion, certainly not in relation to the first reading of a money Bill when any senator may speak on matters relevant or irrelevant to the Bill. It could be said that if a person on the Opposition side or on the Government side raised a certain matter in a first reading debate it would effectively gag any other senator from speaking about that matter during the adjournment debate. Under the first reading rules in the Standing Orders, the debate on the first reading of a money Bill is in effect a grievance debate. It is not a substantive debate on the Bill before the House. If the debate was on a matter associated with a matter of substance in the Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> would be right. On the first reading of a money Bill a senator may roam all over the place. He may talk about chicken farms on Norfolk Island if he likes. He may talk about anything he wishes. Now the Opposition proposes to gag a senator who is exercising his right under the rules in relation to an adjournment debate to express some views on a matter. If the matter which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> wants to raise referred to a second reading debate I believe he would be out of order. I think it would be most improper and wrong to rule him out of order at this stage when the first reading debate was virtually a grievance debate. </para>

            <para>-Certain senators have opposed the right of a senator to raise in the adjournment debate matters which were raised on the first reading of a money Bill. Matters which can be raised on the first reading of a money Bill can be irrelevant and very wideranging.

            <para>-The Royal Commission on Petroleum found that. Let us forget about the royal commission. Let me explain how I came into this exercise. The ACTU entered the petrol discounting business by obtaining an allocation of crude oil from Allied Petrochemicals Pty Ltd. Incidentally, I believe there may be some case for stating that XL Petroleum Pty Ltd, the company of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sykes,</inline> had an entitlement to that crude, but it was ruled that XL did not have entitlement but Allied Petrochemicals did. When the ACTU entered into an arrangement with Allied Petrochemicals to take this allocation of crude it did it in 2 ways. Firstly, it undertook to pay what the then Minister said should be the price paid by any petrol company in Australia, that is $2.10. No company should take an advantage of this special allocation of fuel without at the same time making arrangements to take up an allocation of imported crude which would have made a considerable difference to the price of that allocation of Australian crude. But this was not the case. What the then Minister was made aware of was that the price was to be $2.10. Allied Petrochemicals was prepared to get out of the market and to pass its allocation across to the ACTU at $2.10. By this means ACTUSolo was able to enter the discount market and to discount petrol by as much as 14c a gallon, working on the principle that it could survive on a margin of 2c a gallon provided it got volume sales. This was the method by which the ACTU whether rightly or wrongly- I say wronglydecided to enter the market. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>But the ACTU also intended to enter the market in Brisbane, exercising the same discounting arrangements which would have considerably dislocated and distorted the market. Let me make this perfectly clear: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> was always in support of an orderly market for the distribution of fuel. He was also always concerned about the need to protect those who were importing overseas crude, the price of the overseas crude being as much as three or four times that of Australian crude. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> took the view- in my discussions with him on this matter he supported the view- that there ought to be an orderly market for the distribution of fuel in this country and that the continuing supplies of fuel to this country depended on companies importing overseas crude. It would be grossly unfair for any company to take on a special allocation of Australian crude without at the same time taking the responsibility for the importation of overseas crude. The ACTU being aware of this apparently- whether it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> or someone else- came to the arrangement of accepting this crude at the established price. </para>

            <para>- It would not be what we would consider to be a fair practice, nor is it a fair practice, as I have expressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> to enter the market to discount wildly as the ACTU intended to do in various places to the disadvantage of the whole market and of the living conditions of many people who depend upon the orderly distribution of fuel. There is no doubt that because of the faulty distribution of fuel in Australia the price of petrol is too high. But the question ought not to be attacked in the manner in which the ACTU determined to attack it. It should be attacked in a more orderly fashion, reducing the distribution outlets to some reasonable level so that each person who operates a station at a fair margin can sell at a fair price. </para>

        </continue>
        <para>We- by &#39;we&#39; I mean the Union Co-operative in Queensland which operates 7 petrol selling sites- objected strongly to the ACTU &#39;s entry into the market in the manner in which it entered the market discounting, as I said previously, wildly. We believe that this would distort the market and would in fact lead to the closure of the sites that we have operated not for the past year but for the past 9 years. I made an approach to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> and he agreed that we should be considered. I also made an approach to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> and it is at this point that I strongly believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> was not aware of the second agreement. I feel confident that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> was not aware that anyone was prepared to break the agreement to which all the oil companies agreed, that is, that they would not purchase this oil at a price above $2.10. </para>

            <para>- It was not necessary for the former Minister to go before the Royal Commission and give evidence because the Royal Commission found, as I consider rightly, that the former Minister was not in possession of the full information. In fact I believe that the former Minister- I feel strongly on this- at the present time has been disadvantaged for a variety of reasons. He should not be disadvantaged on the basis of this agreement that ACTU-Solo entered into with Allied Petrochemicals. The Royal Commission found rightly, and I think that it is quite unfair for anyone to bring charges against the former Minister at this stage. He consideredI say it again- that there must be an orderly market for the distribution of fuel in Australia. That was the view that he took. He would not have been a party to, nor did he know of, the methods that ACTU-Solo intended to use, that is, to give a 14c discount out of its 16c margin and to attract volume sale to the disadvantage of the rest of the industry. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I believe that if the ACTU-Solo operation is run correctly, if it is prepared not to distort the market and if it is prepared not to engage in unfair practices, it is one that ought to be supported, and I believe that if the ACTU-Solo organisation was prepared to take responsibility for importing overseas crude, it ought to be given an allocation. The organisation ought to enter the market as all other people enter the market, and on the basis of the organisation&#39;s sales it should receive an Australian allocation. What I resent, firstly, is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and others have said about the former Minister being party to a deception. He was not. What I also object to is that ACTU-Solo should enter into the market using what I consider to be unfair practices of price cutting to the disadvantage of other people in the industry. </para>
        <para>I reiterate that it is quite unfair for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> to attempt to disadvantage <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> further. I believe that he has been disadvantaged enough. It is a little late in the piece for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> to enter this attack. If he seeks by this attack to embarrass the Government further, I do not think he will succeed. I think it would be wise for him to understand and to accept the Royal Commission&#39;s finding that the former Minister was deceived. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> was party to that deception, he must accept the responsibility. If there were others who had knowledge of that deception, perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> should be directing his attack to them. As the matter stands, the Royal Commission found something. We should accept that. We should not pursue it any further. We should not drive <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> any further than we have driven him so far. </para>
