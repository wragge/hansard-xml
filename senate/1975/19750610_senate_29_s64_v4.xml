The Prime Minister wrote: </para>

          <para>When the result of that inquiry is eventually presented to him, he will consider the report. If the report contained discrepancies or matters which he felt required further investigation he would- and I would give an undertaking on his behalf- appoint an independent inquiry if he  thought that was necessary. It will be a matter of judgment based on the nature of the report and the material contained in it. I can assure the Senate that the Prime Minister will act in a most responsible way in respect of the report when it is presented.

            <para>The Dairy Industry Adjustment scheme which was introduced by this Government in 1973 in fact has had an excellent response from all the States, but in particular from Tasmania. There have been no fewer than 126 applications approved to the end of April and I understand that the initial figures for May would suggest a continuing interest by Tasmanian dairymen. The total amount which has been approved for assistance to dairymen themselves is very close to $700,000. In addition to that, approvals of approximately $250,000 have been made available for factory assistance and the restructuring process. I believe that the success of the scheme is unquestioned. The form of assistance now is in direct contrast to the form of assistance that was operating in the industry previously. I am sure that, on all the evidence available so far, this scheme will stop the drift of dairymen out of the industry which has been reaching serious proportions, not in the last 2 years but as a continuing process over the last 10 years. </para>

I have just indicated, and the Prime Minister himself indicated last week, that in respect of the matters that were the subject of some detailed discussion in the House of Representatives last week, such an inquiry will in fact be held and the information relating to that matter will be sought and placed before the Prime Minister. It is, I believe, quite wrong of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack-</inline> I will not say mischievous- but I do not know why he sees the need for such an inquiry to be extended across the whole range of government. I am sure that if the Prime Minister considered such an inquiry necessary he would act accordingly.

            <para>Before deciding on what attitude the Government will take in the national wage case hearing in July it will be necessary to see what happens in the industrial relations arena in the meantime.

            <para>If the conditions we have set down for indexation are violated by even a small section of industry, whether in the award or non-award area, it would put at risk the future of indexation for all. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Government supports the continuation of wage indexation, provided that the conditions set down by the Commission in its decision of 30 April are complied with or substantially complied with. The Government welcomed that decision as a sensible and courageous attempt to introduce in this country a system of wage fixation combining social equity and economic responsibility. I believe that the decision to accept wage indexation in principle and to set conditions to be met if it is to operate on a continuing basis has the support of the overwhelming majority of employees and the greater part of the trade union movement. The Government has already indicated its support for the indexation decision in the national wage case by intervening in the metal industry case before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Moore to support the principles set down in that decision and to submit that the claims in the metal industry should be assessed in terms of the principles of that decision. We shall continue to take action whenever necessary and appropriate to support the principles set down in the decision. </para>

Does the Minister visualise a future external development of Medibank when Australians who have an appendix or similar operation in distant places like Copenhagen or Belgrade will find that, due to reciprocal agreements with European nations, an international coverage will remove them from the extremely tough negotiations they now have to indulge in when they are dealing with hospital and medical benefit funds? </para>

          <para>I must confess that I am sorry I can no longer say this is a matter I will refer to my colleague the Minister for Social Security, and I can assure everybody present that this question was not asked by previous arrangement. I should certainly hope that the sort of thing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> envisages can be accomplished. It must be extremely awkward having problems with one&#39;s appendix when one is in Copenhagen or Belgrade and not only having to go through all the inconvenience of that but then having to confront the hospital and medical funds as well. I will inquire further into the proposal that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> has put forward. I know that he has always been very interested in the portability of pensions, so I take it that he is also interested in the portability of Medibank. That is a matter which I will certainly be examining. </para>

            <para>I answer the question in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for the Media, but the matters to which the honourable senator refers occurred during the time when I was the Minister for the Media. In about February 1974 I announced that arrangements could be made for the restructuring of broadcasting frequencies and that, with the stations going into directional aerial arrangements, more power could be given to broadcasting stations and, by a readjustment of the band, more broadcasting stations could be available to the Australian public. It was as a result of that decision in, I think, February 1974 that 4IP and 4KQ made representations to the Broadcasting Control Board to shift their mast into Moreton Bay, to operate from joint mas ting facilities and to operate at increased power. I understand that the  Chairman  of the Broadcasting Control Board went to Brisbane and had discussions with representatives of all the commercial broadcasting stations, and that after those discussions the Board agreed to the proposal that was submitted by 4IP and 4KQ. </para>

            <para>Yes, I have read the article. I suggest that whoever gave the information to the person concerned was wrongly advised. The assertion is not correct In the article it is claimed that telephone subscribers are paying the higher business rentals because of information supplied by the Taxation Office. The Post Office never seeks nor obtains any information from the Taxation Office. Honourable senators will know that there are 2 rates- one for business rentals and the other for residential rentals. Where there is any doubt as to the classification of a subscriber the subscriber is asked about the use of his telephone and, in some cases, he is asked to make a declaration as to the telephone&#39;s use. The Post Office does not rely on receiving any information from the Taxation Office. </para>

          <para>No,oddly enough they have not told me that. I have been expecting that they would at any time because I noticed the intervention which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh,</inline> with his Per.cipience, also chanced upon- the event which took place in Western Australia whereby the Federal body of the National Country Party by its intervention was able to overwhelm the opinions of apparently the majority of members of the State branch of the Party regarding their participation in the coalition government. But it would seem that as yet the message which is inherent in that event, namely that there ought to be national solidarity, has not penetrated the minds of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> and other prominent figures within the Opposition parties. The only redeeming feature one can see about this, at least insofar as solidarity between the States is concerned, is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewis,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales, has not taken the lead of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamer</inline> in supporting the claim by the doctors for an increase in costs grossly in excess of that which was recommended by the independent tribunal which inquired into that matter. That is an example of the way the divisions, the sharp divisions, between the Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewis,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamer</inline> are of benefit to the people as a whole. </para>

            <para>If the Opposition is interested to know, I can give it a lot of information on the matter. There are 3 distinct aspects of the recent Vietnam situation as far as migration to Australia is concerned. Firstly, there were applications for persons in South Vietnam immediately prior to the change of government there. Secondly, there were the so-called Vietnamese orphan flights. Thirdly, there was the refugee situation following the change of government. Up to the time the Australian Embassy was evacuated on 24 April this year, nominations covering 3667 persons had been received by the Department in Australia. Of these the following were approved: Wives, dependent children and aged parents of Australian residents; wives and dependent children of students for temporary entry only; and those who met normal occupational requirements for migration to Australia. In addition there were some special cases approved at Prime Ministerial and ministerial level. In total 380 of these 3667 persons were approved, most immediately before the embassy was evacuated. How many of these 380 have succeeded in coming to Australia is unknown, but it is a small number. Heavy nominations continued and the final total was 5400. </para>
            </talk.start>
          <para>There have been 2 Vietnamese orphan nights. The first arrived in Sydney on 5 April with 208 children. The second arrived in Melbourne on 1 8 April with 78 children. All children were approved by the then South Vietnamese authorities for movement to Australia for the purpose of adoption. They are under the guardianship of the Minister for Social Security by virtue of the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act. The State and Territorial child welfare authorities are his delegates. Where children were already &#39;linked&#39; to Australian families they were sent to the State or Territory concerned, regardless of whether the family had been approved by the child welfare authorities. Whether the children were then placed with the family concerned was then solely the responsibility of the State or Territorial child welfare authorities. Of 261 children transferred to the States&#39; care some are still in hospital- most, 115, went to South Australia. The numbers going to other States and territories were New South Wales, 62; Victoria, 50; Australian Capital Territory, 13; Queensland, 8; Western Australia, 7; Tasmania 5; and Northern Territory, one. </para>
          <para>Estimates of the total number of persons who left South Vietnam immediately before and after the change of government vary. Most went directly or indirectly to American territory. Guam has had a steady refugee population of around 50 000, despite substantial movements towards the United States. Quite large groups have already been located in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Korea. Two Australian migration officers were sent to Guam to locate approved cases and to approve any others which met the criteria outlined in what I have just mentioned. A total of 64 persons were brought to Australia from Guam on a Royal Australian Air Force Hercules. Three Australian officers, including the two who were in Guam, are currently processing cases in Hong Kong refugee camps. At present more than 170 have been approved and arrangements are being made to bring them to Australia by Qantas charter. The initiative still rests with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and no Australian migration officers have been sent to Korea and Thailand to interview Vietnamese refugees there. I suggest that in the light of this information it is very hard for the Opposition to sustain the thesis it has so regularly plugged that the Australian Government has been indifferent or has dragged its feet in giving attention to the refugee problem. </para>

It is important to realise also that the anticipated deficit for 1975-76 in the United States will be not less than $70,000m which makes it just slightly higher proportionally than we anticipate in this country. It also should be borne in mind that even though there has been a reduction in the proportion of profits going to the private sector in this country in the last 12 months, there has been a higher reduction in the United States. </para>

The United States Government did exactly the same thing. The only difference was that it followed Australia; it was later in doing so. America has exactly the same problems as have all other OECD countries. This is not something which is peculiar to Australia; it is peculiar to a whole range of countries. In fact, Australia has weathered the situation a lot better than most members of the OECD, including America. </para>

            <para>South Australian Police Force and the Post Office have been experimenting with this new system for about 6 months, particularly in the area of Victor Harbour which is not a good area for radio communications. I have been advised by my Department that the tests which have been carried out have proved very satisfactory. It looks as though the system can be adopted generally. Presently Post Office officials and South Australian police are negotiating to see to what extent the system might be applied generally throughout the State. </para>

          <para>I have to confess that I was not aware that there were any arrears. I would say in passing that it does not seem to me that $80,000 is a very large sum considering the number of people who are probably using the facilities and the cost of such facilities. Nonetheless I think that if delay in payment dragged on for any length of time it would be a matter of some seriousness. I undertake to find out from my Department whether there is any undue delay in Tasmania or the other States and, if there is, how it occurred and what can be done to remedy it as soon as possible. </para>

As I said earlier in question time today, the Government has given a proper account of matters involving negotiations for overseas loans. It has been stated on many occasions that it is traditional for a government not to disclose confidential information concerning overseas fund raising. That practice was not introduced by this Government but has been continued from past governments over the years. With regard to further detailed information on this matter, I can only state that the Prime Minister has initiated an inquiry and will consider the contents of the report when he receives it. </para>

            <para>The term wage pause&#39; can be variously interpreted. I certainly was not suggesting anything in the nature of a wage freeze- which of course I assume would be strenuously opposed by the honourable senators opposite, otherwise we undoubtedly would have heard something from them condemning the recent action of the Australian Medical Association in going for a 12.5 per cent increase in doctors&#39; fees. So the expression &#39;wage pause&#39;, as it is suggested by the honourable senator, is not to be interpreted to mean a wage freeze. </para>

            <para>No. Let me state quite clearly my attitude to unionists&#39; claims. I believe that in no circumstances should their standard of living be allowed to drop because of rises in prices of goods. This is what we set out to achieve in our espousal of a program of indexation which has been introduced on a temporary experimental basis by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I believe that if wage increases occur this year in proportions far greater than the rise in the price of commodities, they will have a catastrophic effect on the economy. For that reason I believe that unionists should confine their demands for wage increases, at least during this year, to figures which will cover the loss in purchasing power of their wages, and that they should postpone a request for a greater share of the products of society at least until we have pegged back the rate of inflation. It is in that sense that I use the term &#39;wage pause&#39;. </para>

          <para>I take this opportunity of answering not only the question which has just been asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> but also more fully a very perceptive question which was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> last week in the Senate, the answer to which tended to get lost in the thrust and parry of the repartee associated with some other matters which were raised by way of interjection. I think it is necessary to say first of all that what is meant by reinsurance is the taking by an insurer or re insurer of all or part of the risk which has been entered into by another insurance office. The existence of re insurers enables insurers to issue policies exceeding the amounts which they would otherwise be able to afford to write. Without making the whole matter sound too vulgar, it is a bit like a bookmaker engaging in the operations which we well know bookmakers engage in with other bookmakers when a rather substantial bet has been placed with them. </para>

          <para>It is referred to as laying off, as I am advised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, who is more familiar with these matters than I. Apart from providing this sort of assistance, reinsurance also provides insurance offices with protection against the sort of catastrophe which can sometimes strike them, as was the case in the Darwin cyclone, whereby damage which has occurred can be met by a variety of offices rather than by the one or two offices that happened to be engaging in the insurance business in the area affected. Re insurers also spread their risks by further re insuring some of their business against catastrophe. The reinsurance business is one of the most complex aspects of a very complex industry, and it is very largely operated internationally. Because all of the reinsurance companies in Australia are foreign owned and are either foreign companies or the Australian incorporated subsidiaries of foreign companies, there is a large flow of funds out of Australia. Admittedly, this has not been the case over the last couple of years, when as a result of the various unfortunate episodes that have occurred here, of which the Darwin cyclone was the most recent, a loss has been sustained by re insurers. Taken not over the last couple of years but over the last ten or twenty years, generally speaking, reinsurance has proven to be a profitable undertaking. </para>
          </talk.start>
            <para>If and when the Australian Government Insurance Corporation enters the field of reinsurance it will be able to retain some of this business in Australia. Not only will it be retained in Australia but it will be transacted by an Australian owned reinsurance enterprise. Reinsurance is undertaken only by very large overseas companies because very large potential losses are involved in reinsurance. Whether the Australian Government Insurance Corporation goes into this field will depend on its success as a commercial venture. It may be recollected that last week <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> asked me how, with such small funds as those made available initially, the Corporation can go into the reinsurance business. The answer to that question which was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> and which was in addition to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser&#39;s</inline> question is that this will depend on how successful the Australian Government Insurance Corporation is. </para>
            <para>What we are doing is making it clear that one of the powers of the Board of the Australian Government Insurance Corporation will be the power to engage in reinsurance activities. We ope that when the Corporation is successful it will engage in reinsurance, which in the long run will be of considera ble benefit to the Australian people, but writing reinsurance business is certainly not something which could be done ab into because obviously the necessary funds would not be available until such time as the other commercial activities of the Australian Government Insurance Corporation had proven to be widely supported and successful. </para>

            <para>I realise that the word is unparliamentary. One can imagine the distress it would cause the recipients of such correspondence if it even distresses members of Parliament. Form SU1 1, of whose existence I have to confess I was hitherto unaware but which has recently of necessity come to my attention, is a card that requests people in receipt of unemployment benefit to notify the Department of any change in circumstances. In some instances these forms have been returned by beneficiaries in the mistaken belief that it was necessary to return them even though no change in circumstances had occurred. Such comments as &#39;found new job&#39; have been inserted on these forms, which has resulted in the unemployment benefit being terminated. </para>
          </talk.start>
            <para>Action has been taken by officers of the Department of Social Security to peruse the outgoing mail and to intercept the blank SU11 forms which have been returned. Arrangements have been made for the Australia Police to commence investigations immediately in an attempt to identify the person or persons responsible for this. This is a very serious matter because the receipt of social security benefits by unemployed people is something that is necessary for them. It is certainly a most disgraceful situation if some employee of the Department is taking it upon himself to deprive these people of their social security benefits without any justification by giving misleading information and by writing insulting inscriptions on the mail that is delivered to them. I trust that the malefactor will be apprehended. </para>

            <para>My question, which is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, refers to the subject matter of the first question asked of him this morning in relation to which he made a statement on behalf of the Prime Minister. I ask: Does the Government consider that the relationship that exists between a Minister and the head of his department means that responsibility is indivisible and that confidence and communication must be exchanged without reservation? Did that relationship exist between the former Treasurer and his Permanent Head? If so, why did the Prime Minister write the letter of 6 June in the terms disclosed to the Senate this morning? Did the Prime Minister write in similar terms to any other departmental head? </para>

            <para>Has the Postmaster-General seen the Press reports about the opening of the ethnic radio station in Sydney yesterday? Is it a fact that the licence for that station has been issued in the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bayutti</inline> and that the station operates under his auspices and that of his committee? Is the Postmaster-General aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bayutti,</inline> in presiding at yesterday&#39;s function, issued a Press statement in which the purposes of the station were outlined and to which no reference appears in today&#39;s Press? What is the role of the office of the Special Consultant on Community Relations in the administration of this station? </para>

            <para>Senator Davidson is in a better position than I am to know what is going on at present with that committee because he is a member of the committee. I should have hoped that perhaps he would have told the Minister who is mostly concerned. I have issued the licence, but there are 2 other Ministers concerned with the committee&#39;s performance. I have issued the licence under an arrangement made with the other Ministers- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Enderby,</inline> who is the Minister responsible for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> &#39;s operations. As to what might be going on, I would have preferred and expected <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill,</inline> who has already given me and the other Ministers concerned a report not on yesterday&#39;s meeting but on the last meeting, to have recommended to me what course of action might be adopted. I do not think that it is my job to report this, but I think that I can say with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland &#39;s concurrence that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> &#39;s role is purely an advisory one in relation to the committee. </para>

            <para>The last figures that I have show that the total strength of the Services has increased by 250 persons. Recruitment has been exceedingly good. The later figures show that recruitments totalled 6 1 3 in April compared with 408 at the same time last year. The number of officer resignations has dropped. The number of male officers resigning and leaving the Services was 39 in April and of these 27 were officers who were eligible for a pension and who in effect retired early. Officer resignations for the 4-month period ended April 1975 totalled 178, a fall of 43 per cent. In addition, re-engagement figures are very high. They include rates of 66 per cent for the Navy, 77 per cent for the Army and 86 per cent for the Air Force. </para>

            <para>I welcome the contribution which the honourable senator has just made to the forthcoming campaign in Bass, but I think that a question like his deserves most careful consideration which I propose to give to it. One arm of the question which has just been put to me reveals the new-found concern of honourable senators opposite for the plight of small businessmen. As I pointed out in answer to, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> last week, the plight of the small businessman engaged the belated attention of the Liberal-Country Party coalition around the year 1968. So steamed up was the coalition about the plight of the small businessman that it initiated an inquiry into his plight. It was a leisurely inquiry and a report found its way in due <inline font-style="italic">course</inline> on to the shelves of the Liberal - Country Party coalition about the year 1970. But by December 1972 when this Government came to office no action had been taken in respect of that report and we still do not know what that report contained. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>By contrast this Government took speedy action to set up small business bureaux as a pilot scheme, in Perth and Sydney. At the bureaux advice can be given to small businessmen. We hope that the advice will enable them to improve their operations. A study of the plight of small businessmen over the years would convince the honourable senator, and indeed all honourable senators, that at all times a high proportion of small businesses do go bankrupt. That proves nothing more, in my view, than that a large number of people who undertake business are ill-equipped to undertake business at all. </para>
          <para>As to the others in the community for whom the honourable senator&#39;s heart bleeds, I think it has to be agreed that, in the unforeseen economic circumstances in which we find ourselves today and which are due largely to forces beyond our control, the Government has moved speedily to alleviate the lot of those who do feel the chill economic winds which are, of course, but temporary. The various schemes that we have undertaken, such as the Regional Employment Development scheme and various schemes under the structural adjustment program, are doing everything which it is possible for a government to do to alleviate the plight of those who are not at work at the present time. In addition, the Government has undertaken a whole series of remedial actions which I feel confident will soon get the economy back on an even keel. </para>

            <para>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Media. I refer to a question asked of the Minister by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> last Thursday in relation to the number of repeats of television programs on Australian television stations. Is it a fact that television channels participate in an auction or ballot type system for the purchase of overseas series and feature films, thereby creating a most unreal price for these products? If that is so, would it not be one of the contributing factors in the high rate of repeats, to enable the channels at least to get value for their money? If the answer to both those questions is in the affirmative, will the Minister advise what action can be taken by either his Department or the Broadcasting Control Board to bring a more realistic price level to these products, thereby eliminating the necessity for innumerable repeats being foisted on the Australian public? </para>

            <para>When I first became Minister for the Media, there had been in practice an operation whereby television stations in Australia would purchase programs from abroad on a packaging arrangement. In other words, if one station wanted to purchase a program it would have to purchase with that program a number of other programs. In the early life of my Department we conducted negotiations with the stations and they agreed that they would not engage in that sort of activity, and I assume that that sort of activity is no longer in existence. However, the matter is now one for my colleague, the Minister for the Media. I think I should refer the matter to him because it no longer falls within my jurisdiction. </para>

            <para>Senator Chaney is obviously referring to a statement which was made last week by the Prime Minister to the effect that the Social Welfare Commission in its present form would be abolished and would take the form in future of a bureau within one or other of the social welfare departments. I should have thought that the Opposition would welcome this because, as I understood it, one of the Opposition&#39;s complaints about the Labor Government was that it had too many commissions. </para>

            <para>The Opposition does not object to this one; it likes the Social Welfare Commission. Certainly any actions which are taken by the Public Service Board, as I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> would know, are taken by the Board independently of what the Government does. I am not in a position to direct the Public Service Board on what it does. In fact, one of the problems that I seem to have had since I have been a Minister is taking directions from the Public Service Board rather than vice versa. All I can say is that it is proposed that there should be a more rational organisation of the whole of the social welfare system of Australia. I would say that there has been- I would think, indeed I would hope, that members of the Opposition would agree with me- unnecessary duplication of a great many functions in the whole social welfare field. It will be one of my purposes to try to eliminate this duplication. Certainly if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> is suggesting that some vindictive action has been taken, that the Government has not done enough about poverty, or if he is arguing that insufficient has been done about the Regional Employment Development scheme, or the National Employment and Training scheme, I would be interested to debate the matter with him. If he is suggesting that in some way we have not been assisting Professor Henderson&#39;s inquiry into poverty, I would be very interested to debate this matter also with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> and find out the propositions he is putting forward. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not think that any government has done more to eliminate poverty within Australia than this Government has done. But in any event, there will need to be full discussion concerning the future of the Social Welfare Commission and the functions which are presently performed by the Commission. It was established by legislation. If it is ultimately to be abolished, it will have to be abolished by legislation. I would hope that this is a matter which will be dealt with in a co-operative non-partisan manner. The Commission was established by this Government and I trust that the Opposition will not try to make some party political capital out of administrative arrangements, the purpose of which is to bring about rationalisation, the elimination of duplication and the consequent saving of the Australian people&#39;s money. </para>

            <para>Mr President, earlier this morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> asked me a question about what I suppose could be described as the portability of Medibank benefits.  His  question related to the position of somebody who might be taken ill in a foreign country. The objective of the Government is to see that when Medibank is fully operating and all of the States have adopted the hospital benefit branch as well as the medical benefit branch of the Medibank service, arrangements will be entered into with those countries which have national health services to see that they are made reciprocal. Unfortunately it will be necessary for all the States to have entered into the hospital benefit arrangements, otherwise we would find the anomaly that somebody from South Australia, for example, would be able to go to Denmark or Austria or Britain and receive hospital benefits, but not be able to get them if he went to Victoria, Western Australia or any State which had not adopted the hospital side of Medibank. Certainly this is our intention, and there is no doubt that if all the countries with national health services do work co-operatively in this way it will be of great benefit to many people, both people visiting this country and people from Australia who are visiting other countries. </para>

        <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
        <para class="block">Honourable senators will recall the recent enactment of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act and the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act. These historic Acts represented the first firm evidence by an Australian Government of a co-ordinated approach to the protection and management of&#34; this nation&#39;s natural resources. More recently, my colleagues, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and the Minister for Environment have introduced a Bill to establish an Australian Heritage Commission. This Bill builds on these foundations. As honourable senators will know, the Government introduced a series of amendments in the other place which were the result of discussions between the Minister for Environment and Opposition representatives. Additionally, an amendment was moved by the Opposition which was accepted by the Government. The Bill which comes forward to the Senate, therefore, reflects the bi-partisan support that this Bill has. </para>
        <para>The Great Barrier Reef, a vast collection of islands and coral reefs, extends along some 1900 kilometres of the Australian Coast. This nationally and internationally important marine ecosystem encompasses many unique forms of sea life, and is the largest and most complex expanse of living coral reefs in the world- quite possibly the largest which has ever existed. It is an area of unique beauty and of irreplaceable scientific value. Most simply, the Reef is a significant part of the world&#39;s heritage- a priceless heirloom which we must safeguard for future generations. No previous Australian Government has demonstrated the conviction necessary to act on this obvious truth. Marine ecosystems, especially the rich inshore parts, are vital to the survival of many species, including man. They are the breeding grounds and nurseries of species upon which the world&#39;s commercial fisheries depend and of many other species vital to the complex food webs of the marine environment. To ensure that marine ecosystems generally are protected in a comprehensive manner, I will be introducing a Marine Environment Protection Bill in the Budget session of the Parliament. </para>
        <para>Only recently has the park concept been applied to the oceans, but already it has achieved world-wide acceptance as an important conservation priority. This is due partly to the realisation that man is increasingly turning to the sea to solve food shortage problems and because of concern that he is over-using the seas as a cesspool for the toxic wastes resulting from his ever increasing activities. The creation of viable marine parks is not without problems. Even so, many marine national parks have been created throughout the world. Highly industrialised Japan, one of the most populated parts of the world, for instance, had reserved 23 marine park areas by 1974. Undoubtedly the future declaration of marine parks and reserves will be difficult for most countries. Those with highly developed technologies will be torn between the desire physically to exploit the sea&#39;s resources and the demands of conservationists and re creationists for areas to be reserved. Less developed countries, particularly the small island areas, also will be torn between the desire for commercial exploitation of their offshore areas and the traditional dependence of their people on marine resources for subsistence. While the Australian Government cannot stand apart from such conflicts of interest, it has decided that protection of our unique Barrier Reef is of paramount importance to Australia and the world. </para>
        <para>This Bill proposes the establishment of a Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority which will examine the entire Barrier Reef region, determine which sections of the region should be proclaimed as part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and decide appropriate uses for its various sections. It has been prepared after extensive consultations with departments and organisations concerned with all aspects of the Reef. Once the legislation is passed the Government will be able to declare and protect zones of the Reef as national parks or nature reserves, which will then be managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Other zones will be set aside for tourist development, shipping, fishing, and other appropriate uses. However, conservation and protection of the Great Barrier Reef will be the paramount aim of the Authority in all zones of&#34; the Marine Park. The Bill specifically excludes operations for the recovery of minerals within the declared Marine Park areas except by or with the approval of the Authority for the purpose of research and investigations relevant to the establishment, care and development of the Marine Park or for scientific research. </para>
        <para>I am sure this Bill will receive the support of all Australians who are concerned that our magnificent natural heritage should be preserved. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

            <para>On the last day of sitting I was talking about this very significant Health Insurance Bill which is before the Senate today. It is designed to enable patients of optometrists and those people who go to ophthalmologists for refractive treatment to be afforded a benefit under the National Health legislation. Since that time, of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> has been elevated- I think that would be the term- to a position of responsibility in the social security area. No doubt he is looking forward to the headaches that this responsibility will create for him and if he has any as the no pic symptoms that may be attributed to refractive causes I would be available for him for a consultation. But I do not think the problems will be refractive; I think he is going to have problems that are far more difficult to deal with than that. I believe that no health scheme is complete or can be considered to be universal until all areas in the field of health care are recognised. </para>

            <para>I am glad to see the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wheeldon)</inline> acknowledging that statement. As I said last week, it has been a long time since the optometrists started their campaign to get recognition for their patients. At last their desires have been brought to fruition. But, as I started to say earlier. This Bill has opened the door for the inclusion in the health scheme of all other professions working in the field of health care. I refer particularly to preventive dentistry. I recognise that when the Gorton Government was administering this country we did take a step in the direction of dental care by introducing a benefit for special oral surgery. I think that preventive dentistry is a must as far as the Government health scheme is concerned. Perhaps physiotherapy, chiropody and, ultimately, chiropractic treatment, when it attracts some sort of recognition throughout Australia, might be included in the health scheme. </para>

            <para>I should think so. Nevertheless, I mention that in passing because 1 know some chiropractors do have the regard of the medical profession. In the private area, the profession of hearing consultants also has been neglected. I believe that hearing aid consultants ought to accept the challenge to provide a technical course of study for their students who wish to pursue that career. They ought to aim to be included in the health legislation of the various States in a similar way to optometrists. From time to time orthotist have been mentioned. The orth optic profession is not registered in each State, and orthotist are required to work under the supervision of an ophthalmologist or an optometrist. The position has been described in a paper by the New South Wales Crown Solicitor. It refers to the New South Wales Act and mentions the penalties. 1 will read the whole section.

            <para>My attitude- I think it would represent the attitude of our Party- is that certain benefits ought to apply to orth optics, similar to benefits for physiotherapy. We believe that sustained physiotherapy treatment as a result of an accident, cerebral thrombosis or similar condition ought to be recognised under the Act and that patients in that category ought to be provided with some extra benefit at this time. I think I could say that our Party would support the idea of extending the benefits to cover protracted orth optic treatment due to some trauma affecting the eye muscles which requires persistent eye exercises. </para>

I mention my colleagues <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume, Senator Sheil, Senator Guilfoyle, Senator Drake-Brockman, Senator Marriott</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley,</inline> all of whom have participated in the formulation of our ideas and our attitude to this Bill.

            <para>The Opposition is concerned, of course, as no doubt the Government will be, that this provision should not be over utilised. I demonstrated in my speech last Thursday night, that the optometric profession also is concerned to see that practitioners do not over utilise this benefit. The Liberal-National Country Party Opposition will be watching this very closely to ensure that the practitioners concerned continue to act responsibly in the interests of the patient and in the interests of the taxpayer who will have to foot the bill. If there is any abuse of this scheme we are determined to have a look at it and to rectify it when we return to government. </para>

            <para>It is with pleasure that I follow our optometric al colleague opposite in supporting the Health Insurance BUI 1975. It is also with pleasure that I note that the new Minister for Social Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon,</inline> is handling this Bill now in his own right rather than on behalf of anyone else. This Bill, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> has told us, amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 and includes under the health insurance scheme benefits for patients of optometrists. This, as is known, has been a policy of the Labor Party for some time and covers a gap which existed in the health insurance scheme which worried many patients and which caused great confusion among the patients who, at times, went to optometrists and at times went to ophthalmologists. I think it is perfectly justified because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Jessop has told us, refraction and the correction of sight difficulties is an important part of health care in this country. </para>
          <para>The relationship between the medical profession and the optometric al profession in this country has not been a very happy one at times, particularly at the official level. I, with others, have for many years been disturbed at this lack of harmony. I remember some years ago being at a meeting of the Australian Medical Association when an attempt was made to have medical practitioners ostracise or ignore the presence of optometrists and refer all their patients to ophthalmologists at all times for all purposes. I believe that this policy was always an impractical one and it was particularly noted to be impractical by us who practised medicine in country or non-metropolitan areas. The ophthalmologists, the medical specialists- there are some 500 of them, I believe- like other medical specialists in this country have tended to congregate in the large metropolitan areas and to have been in very short supply in non-metropolitan areas and in small country towns, whereas the optometrists, of whom there are 1,000 or more, have been spread more evenly throughout the country. It has been very difficult at times for doctors practising in rural areas to have patients&#39; refractions done and patients&#39; visual defects corrected by ophthalmologists, who frequently live a long way away. </para>
          <para>Therefore, from the point of view of economics for the patient and convenience for the patient, doctors in rural areas have tended to cooperate very much with optometrists and to send patients to optometrists for ordinary corrective services. Of course, this has been possible because the members of the optometric al profession generally have shown themselves to be efficient, to be ethical in their behaviour and to be concerned about advances and further education in their own profession. Since the early part of this century they have been accepted as professionals, and careful professionals at that, by the patients and by the population of this country, and they are continuing to be accepted in that way. I believe that the optometric al profession has been very careful to maintain its high standards of ethics and practice in the community, and I must say that its actions in dealing with the public, the media and the various political parties and departmental officers in this community have been very different from the actions of some members of my own profession. The members of the optometric al profession have not used the histrionics and the hypocrisy that we have seen sometimes from members- I must say that I think it is a minority of members- of my own profession. For instance, optometrists have accepted the concept of an independent fee fixing tribunal for the purposes of this Bill, and they have accepted the need to provide care for pensioners without burdening the pensioners with great costs on top of what is provided in this Bill. </para>
          <para>Concern has been expressed by many people in the community, as well as by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop,</inline> that the provisions of this Bill should not be abused, that over-use of the provisions for extra consultations each year for certain conditions should not be abused. I know that some ophthalmologists and others were rather concerned that the Bill should be more restrictive in this regard and that there should be introduced regulations which would restrict more carefully the number of consultations allowed. However, I believe that the behaviour of optometrists in the past and the guarantees that they have given to the Government for the future will mean that they will not abuse the provisions of this Bill. But I warn optometrists that I will join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> in condemning them if they do so. However, they have shown themselves to be responsible people and to be concerned about the patient and the reputation in the community of their profession. </para>
          <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline>mentioned that this Bill may be the start for widening the scope of health insurance in this country to include other professional groups, and I daresay that over the years, as people come to realise that this country can afford, and that the people deserve, to have universal health care in the fullest meaning of that phrase, some of these other professions will be included. Honourable senators on both sides of the chamber have been concerned that some patients, particularly those with cleft palates, should have the benefit of ort hod ont al treatment which is essential to their care. We have been working hard to have this benefit introduced, and we hope that a satisfactory arrangement for its introduction soon will be brought into the Parliament. I believe that the difficulty with chiropractors always has been and always will remain not so much that the medical profession is opposed to chiropractic but that chiropractors cannot agree among themselves on who is a chiropractor and who is not. Almost every attempt in this country, including one in Tasmania and to a lesser extent one in Western Australia, to register chiropractors has tended to fall down because chiropractors argue among themselves and will not set up professional standards which everyone can apply. I hope that the new inquiry by the Australian Government into the chiropractic profession will bring chiropractors together and help to sort out these problems so that chiropractors can arrive at a proper scientific basis for their profession and open up the methods of their profession to scientific scrutiny. Until we can see that their results are what they and some of their patients claim them to be I feel sure that no one in this community can contemplate the registration of chiropractors and the payment of health benefits to chiropractors. </para>

            <para>I accept that. 1 accept that some of their methods are probably very good, just as some of our methods are good and perhaps some are not so good, but until there is a proper analysis of their methods we will not get anywhere. I am pleased to see this Bill go through the Parliament. I am sure that members of the Australian Optometric al Association are even more pleased to see this Bill go through. They have been haunting the portals of this Parliament for the last 3 weeks waiting for this Bill to come up in the Senate and for it to be debated. I am sure they have had an interesting time. I am sure they have been well entertained. Unfortunately the Bill did not quite go through the Senate on Thursday night but I am assured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop, Senator Baume</inline> and by the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wheeldon)</inline> that the BDI will go through the Senate today. I commend the Government for bringing in this Bill. I commend the Opposition for not opposing it. I certainly do not oppose it. I welcome it as a fulfilment of another policy of this Government and of this Party. It will be welcomed, I am sure, by all patients of optometrists, ophthalmologists and doctors everywhere. </para>

          <para>The Senate is debating the Health Insurance Bill 1975 which aims to give health insurance benefits to patients of optometrists. The Bill in fact concerns all the helping professions the medical profession, the paramedical profession and all the groups which make up what we now call the helping professions. The Bill represents a major departure in health insurance practice in a couple of ways. For that reason it is worth examining the Bill, what it proposes and also having a look at what the optometric al profession has agreed to. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is a major new step in the provision of benefits and we have indicated that the Opposition will support the measure. I support the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> who set out in some detail the training and professional status of optometrists. I do not intend to traverse that ground again. We are discussing patients and whether people who need professional help are going to get it and whether they are going to get help of good quality and competence. I accept the competence of optometrists in their own area of practice and the role they have to play. I see no reason why their patients should not receive benefits under the health insurance scheme. </para>
          <para>The policy which the Australian Labor Party is implementing in this Bill is different from the policy proposed by the Opposition in only a couple of ways, but it is worth mentioning what these are. For a start, the Opposition was aware that the practices of ophthalmic surgeons and optometrists overlapped particularly in the area of&#34; refraction and it had been proposed by the Opposition that benefits should be paid to patients of optometrists for these services where overlapping existed. So the wording of our policy was that benefits be paid to patients of optometrists for those non-medical refractive services normally rendered by optometrists. The Government has elected to extend the provision of benefits more widely and it has brought in the further question of overlapping where the practice of optometrists, for example, will overlap that of orthoptists. I will come back and mention that briefly later. Secondly, the Opposition proposes that there should be some limit on the number of services rendered annually and again the Government has elected not to follow that proposal. But most importantly there was nothing in the Opposition&#39;s policy to indicate that the arrangement would bind the profession. There was nothing to indicate that we were to have, had the Opposition policy come in, a participating profession. </para>
          <para>The Government&#39;s proposals, on the other hand, have broken entirely new ground because for the first time we have a profession which has elected to participate as a profession and, as a profession, to accept the concept of bulk billing. This is a major departure. The optometrists have decided that they as a group will embark on a road which other professions have viewed with considerable reserve and concern. Benefits are to be paid only to patients of participating optometrists. These matters are set out in clause 8 of the Bill which refers to the common form of undertaking which is to be drawn up after consultation with the Australian Optometric al Association. The common form of undertaking is to include, among other things, the kinds of services and assurances by optometrists that the fees they charge will not exceed the appropriate fees specified. The common form of undertaking also contains an assurance by optometrists that when asked they will give to eligible pensioners or members of low income groups, or dependants of such persons, the right of assignment of benefits. So in the common form of undertaking we have an agreement that it will be a participating profession and an agreement that there will be an assignment of benefits- that is to say bulk billing of the Government in respect of patients by the optometrists who take part. There is an interesting part of clause 8 which says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Minister may, at any time, after consultation with the Australian Optometric al Association, vary the common form of undertaking. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I would like the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wheeldon)</inline> to assure us that should there be disagreement with the Australian Optometric al Association he would not proceed to vary the common form of undertaking because, as I read the Bill, particularly the words of clause 8 (3), the Minister is under no obligation to heed the views of the Australian Optometric al Association at any time should he wish to vary the common form of undertaking. He may care to give me assurances on this matter. I am sure he has been following it and can answer me in regard to that point. </para>
          <para>The medical profession has been particularly concerned, as a profession and as a participating group, about the implication of assignment of benefits. The medical profession, unlike most other professions, has had experience of participating schemes. Its experience in the pensioner medical service and the repatriation service have led it to have some reservations about the procedures adopted by governments for the updating of benefits and of the use of tribunals by governments. We are seeing an experimental situation whereby a profession is setting out to do something it has never done before. It is placing considerable trust in the Government and in the new Minister for Social Security. It is trusting that he and the Government will play fair in regularly updating benefits and ensuring that the kinds of complaints which followed the activities of tribunals under the pensioner medical and repatriation services will not be repeated with regard to the practice of optometrists and the provision of optometric al benefits. It is reasonable to draw upon the experience of the past in this kind of scheme in suggesting that problems could lie ahead. </para>
          <para>I want to refer again to the question of orthotist and remind the Senate that there are 174 orthotist in Australia, mostly in private practice. Most of them operate independently, to answer the Minister&#39;s question earlier, although they act only on referral. Many of them have their services - </para>

              <para>Yes, they are independent in that sense. Some of them are situated in close proximity to ophthalmic surgeons or optometrists but they still operate independently. Their concern is that there is a new situation of overlap. A patient who receives orth optic services from an optometrist now will be eligible for a rebate whereas the same patient seeing an orth opt i st will not attract any rebate for equivalent care and equivalent services. In Australia we have quite a good number of orthotist per head of population- more than in the United Kingdom in fact- and there is quite a role for them to fulfil. It was estimated in Cardiff in the United Kingdom as a result of a survey that, for example, about 7 per cent of children under the age of 5 years have muscle abnormalities requiring orth optic care. I simply remind the Minister that orthotist in the 2 &#38; years training they do, spend about 1750 hours learning orth optics alone while their optometric al colleagues, who are also trained in orth optics, spend about 150 hours training in that same field of practice. I am not suggesting in anyway that there is anything wrong with orth optics being practised by optometrists. I am simply saying that the orthotist are a well qualified group. </para>

              <para>I accept that. I point out to the Minister that a register is kept by the Australian College of Ophthalmologists. I think it should be relatively simple to have the States look at the question of extending registration to orthoptists. We will want to see a regular and fair review of benefits under the scheme to be introduced by this Bill. We hope also that the optometrists will confine the bulk of their services to non-medical refractive services, the kind of thing which they do so well and for which 1 for one have sought their help in the past when I have needed new spectacles. I remind the Senate that the optometrists themselves were involved in a survey which established the relative frequency of first, second and third visits. Figures are available suggesting that 35 per cent of optometrists&#39; patients require a second visit and 9 per cent of their patients require a third visit. There are figures available which will be used as a yardstick against which to measure future utilisation of optometric al services. In taking part in this survey, perhaps optometrists have created a rod for their own backs. If third and subsequent visits come to exceed 9 per cent of total visits, the baseline figure, by any significant amount it would be reasonable to ask the question: Why? I hope the optometrists will exert the kind of close control of their own activities which will avoid any of these questions arising in the future. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>Referring to figures which the optometrists have produced, they have indicated that a small percentage- perhaps three per cent or four per cent- of patients going to them have significant pathology. I am aware, for example, that most optometrists if they see patients with pathology refer them immediately for medical care. But since the consequences of delay in referral can be so catastrophic in matters affecting vision, I hope that the optometrists will continue to display the same high standard of ethical conduct and rapid referral to which we are accustomed. I hope that there will be regular evaluation of the use of services by optometrists. I hope that we will have made available to us the number of services rendered by optometrists each year, the cost and the breakdown of first, second, and third visits- particularly third and subsequent visits- so that we can see the amount of utilisation and what is happening to the cost of these services in the community. </para>
            <para>I repeat that this is not just a Bill concerning optometric al benefits; it is our first experiment in which one profession has elected as a group to become participating, to lose its right to charge independent fees and to accept completely the bulk billing principle. The profession is getting what it asked for. It is getting from the Government what it agreed to accept. We support the Bill on that basis. But it is still unlike what we would have offered. We would not have demanded that the profession be a totally participating group or that it utilise the bulk billing mechanism on a compulsory basis if members wished to be in the scheme. We have yet to determine whether this road down which the optometrists have decided to walk is as rocky as other professions fear it is. They have a view that it is a primrose path. Only time will tell whether this is correct. We have yet to determine the true costs and benefits of this scheme. We will watch annual reports closely. We support the Bill. We are in favour of the benefits which will come to the patients of optometrists. I finish by making the brief observation that all too often we talk about optometrists and assume that the benefits flowing to them are necessarily in the best interests of patients in the same way as we sometimes worry about how much the doctors get and assume that that might be in the best interests of their patients. Whether the patients will be better off may be a completely different matter. It is a situation which we will watch independently and closely. </para>

            <para>This Health Insurance Bill has been discussed at length and without any dissent, and it is not necessary for me to go further into the aspects of the discussion. I rise mainly to further sow the seed for the expansion of the national health scheme. At the outset I congratulate the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wheeldon)</inline> on his second reading speech which was most explanatory. It was in line with the philosophy of the Medibank legislation. This legislation is designed to provide an important system of health benefits. The proposal was discussed with the Australian Medical Association and the Australian College of Ophthalmologists. The interests of all parties were well protected. I think that is a state of affairs for which we should be very grateful to the Minister. He has been able to introduce this legislation after it was originally thought some pitfalls were in the offing. He is to be congratulated on that happy state of affairs. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think the Government and the Australian Optometric al Association are also to be complimented for the part that they have both played in putting their cases. As a result of that, unanimity has been reached between all members of that section of the profession which I think will stand the Australian public in very good stead. The more comprehensive a national health scheme can be, the better for the community. This is a most commendable Bill. As I see it, the main aspect of the Bill is that the Government recognises the special arrangements which will be made in relation to persons living in isolated areas. </para>
          <para>I said that I rose in this debate mainly in connection with the expansion of the national health scheme. It is necessary that any national health scheme should be all-embracing. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> was speaking the Minister made a statement in connection with chiropractors. He suggested that there could be some difficulty in that field. For a national health scheme to be a national health scheme it is incumbent on Government to see that people are protected against every ill. It is an impossibility for people to determine the illness with which they might be inflicted. It is an impossibility for people to determine in what type of accident they might be involved and what the result of that accident will be. So when the Government says that it is necessary to have a national health scheme include medical, hospital and now optical aspects, it is also necessary for that Government to ensure that the Bill is all-embracing. I can speak with some conviction as one who owes much to the profession of the chiropractor. </para>
          <para>As we have advanced a further stage by admitting optometry to the national health scheme I would like to see an advance to yet a further stage whereby dentistry, chiropractic and other professional occupations in the health field are included to make it an overall Bill. A fundamental of any national scheme is that it should apply to all concerned and the fundamental of this national health scheme is that it should create equality and equity as between all members of the community. Some members have to see a medical man, others have to see a dentist, an optician or a chiropractor and others have to be inmates of hospitals. This scheme has been dubbed as a national health scheme and it is necessary therefore to maintain an equality between people who by way of general taxation pay for the national health scheme to ensure that they are covered in respect of any malady with which they may be inflicted. It is a wrong state of affairs that a person can consult a medical practitioner and get relief from the national health scheme and cannot receive similar consideration when requiring specialist attention of a chiropractor, not being able to get that benefit under the national health scheme. If there is one aspect of this matter that should apply definitely, it is that full equity should apply in all forms of taxation and in all forms of rating. It is definitely wrong that in our community today people who require the services of a professional chiropractor are not covered under the national health scheme and it is just as bad for people not to be able to claim as a taxation deduction fees paid to a chiropractor. </para>
          <para>Equity is everything. The law of equity is the greatest law we have, but it is not applying in this instance. While congratulating the Minister for having brought in this further extension of the national health scheme I would appeal to him to have a very close look at further extending the scheme so that we may have a health scheme which is truly national. I congratulate the Minister on the part that he has played in introducing this Bill. I thank him for the way in which he presented it and I look forward to having him look at the possibility, as I know he will, of further extending the Bill so that there may be that equality applying to all members of the community which is desired in a national- I stress the word &#39;national&#39;- health bill. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>in reply- I thank all honourable senators who have taken part in this debate and I appreciate the support which has been given to the Bill by members of the Opposition. I think it is appropriate first of all to make some comment on the remarks that were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunton.</inline> I certainly share with him the desire that a national health service should be a fully comprehensive national health service. This means naturally that if people require treatment other than that which is given by medical practitioners or optometrists the scheme could well be extended to include many other fields. However, chiropractors- and there are some other people who fall into the same sort of category as chiropractors, that is to say, osteopaths and naturopaths- are in a somewhat different position from that of optometrists. Whatever arguments there may have been about optometrists from members of the medical profession, there could not be any argument that optometry is a rigidly scientific discipline following the established empirical methods handed down through the years which are known as scientific method. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One of the difficulties of practices such as those of chiropractors, osteopaths and naturopaths, as I understand it, is that the assumptions on which they base their practices are not those that could be described, in the strict sense of the word, as scientific, but there are certain premises which they bring to their fields which it would be difficult to refute or confirm. They are not, in the strict sense of the word again, scientific disciplines. That is not to say that they, particularly chiropractors, have not obviously brought about tangible benefits to certain people who have received their services. I think it is quite well known that a number of medical practitioners do on occasions refer their patients to such people as chiropractors for attention. The difficulty- and this also applies to orthotist- is that they are not legally registered except in Western Australia where there is a Chiropractors Registration Board, but even in that State there are difficulties owing to the fact that there are now, apparently, 2 associations both claiming to represent chiropractors, each disclaiming the validity of the other&#39;s qualifications. At present the Department of Health is engaged in a study of chiropractic and I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunton</inline> and other honourable senators will be interested to learn what the Department of Health concludes about this subject, but until that is done I certainly would not be in a position to give any undertaking. </para>
          <para>I have noted for a long time the interest which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> has taken in this question. We all know that he is an optometrist by profession and, if I may say so, he and I on occasions have formed something of a united front on the part of optometrists against some of our colleagues on both sides of the chamber. We are pleased that the Australian Optometric al Association has come to this agreement with the Australian Government. Certainly optometry is one of the most important paramedical fields of activity and a great many Australians already take advantage of the facilities that are provided by optometrists. Doubtless there are many more who could be making more use of optometrists than is being made at present. One of the purposes of a national health scheme and of introducing this Bill which is now before the Senate is to see that people who in the past felt themselves precluded for financial reasons from consulting optometrists are able to do so. </para>
          <para>It is very gratifying that the Australian Optometric al Association has taken such a reasonable attitude and has been able to come to agreement with the Government on the question of bulk billing. One thing which I would like to say about optometrists is that from my studies of their qualifications, which I confess I have only made over the past year, I think it has been most unfair that they have not been given greater recognition in the past. There have been exchanges in the Press between Associate Professor Hollows, the  Chairman  of the Department of Ophthalmology at the School of Surgery in the University of New South Wales who, I think it is fair to say, has had some quite derogatory things to say about optometrists, and Professor Lederer, to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> referred, who is head of the School of Optometry at the University of New South Wales. </para>
          <para>One instance in one university, which was drawn to my attention, which struck me as a most anomalous situation, occurred because of the ethics of ophthalmologists, that an ophthalmologist should not give lectures to students of optometry. Because they do not give lectures to potential optometrists, some ophthalmologists have been saying that optometrists are not properly qualified because they have not received any teaching from ophthalmologists. Yet we find at the same time that within the department of ophthalmology in the same university, optometrists are lecturing to students of ophthalmology. This is a most ridiculous situation and an example of a rather unfortunate sort of a closed shop approach to learned professions. If this Bill does nothing else, if it can do something to remedy this sort of situation I think it will be of great advantage, because optometrists are very highly qualified. One of our audience today, for example, holds the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in optometry, and certainly someone who holds those qualifications from one of the leading Australian universities cannot be regarded as being other than a man very eminent in his profession. </para>
          <para>I do not wish to prolong the matter unduly, but some questions have been asked of me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> to which I would like to refer. The first question to which I would come is a question he asked me with regard to the specifications of optometrists &#39; premises. Proposed new section 23a (2) (b) in clause 8 of the Bill, which deals with this matter, does not mean that the Minister can determine the plan of consulting rooms and facilities that should be provided by participating optometrists. The Minister would not want to do this in relation to the premises of optometrists or medical practitioners. In fact, the relevant clause does not mean that he can do that. As was pointed out in the second reading speech, regard will be had in the common form of undertaking to the fact that a participating optometrist may be a person or a company employing optometrists. In such cases the participating optometrist providing optometric al services at a number of practice locations may wish to enter into an undertaking in respect of only some of those locations. The locations to be covered by the undertaking will be specified in the undertaking, and the specification will merely list the addresses of each place of practice to be covered by the undertaking. This is very largely for the convenience of the optometrist himself and I think it has no significance other than that. </para>
          <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline>drew attention to the statement that provision should be made for other low income groups. He wished to know what was actually meant by that. It was said, when the Government&#39;s proposals were first introduced, that in the case of people benefiting from the pensioner medical service low income earners and similar people covered by the present subsidised health benefits arrangements we plan to enter into arrangements with optometrists under which consultations are provided free of charge to the patient. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> quite properly asked the question, because under the Health Insurance Act there is no specific provision for low income persons similar to the subsidised health benefits provisions of the National Health Act. Eligible pensioners, that is people who are eligible to receive the pensioner medical service, and their dependants are the only group for which special arrangements are envisaged to enable medical services to be provided at no direct cost to the pensioner. </para>
          <para>Because of problems of identifying eligibility and other low income groups solely for the purposes of the optometric al consultations benefits, and because of possible anomalies if some persons are entitled to optometric al but not medical services free of charge, this question was deferred. It was considered that the most appropriate course would be to provide under the common form of undertaking for free optometric al consultations for eligible pensioners and dependants as defined in the National Health Act and for any other low income groups subsequently agreed to between the Australian Optometric al Association and the Australian Government. So nothing will be inflicted on optometrists. In due course, once the scheme is operating, we will doubtless have consultations which may be initiated by us and which may be initiated by optometrists at which we can arrive at some mutually satisfactory definition. </para>
          <para>The Australian Optometric al Association has agreed in principle with the requirement that participating optometrists accept the assigned benefits in full payment for most services to eligible pensioners and dependants and to any other agreed low income groups. The undertaking to be signed by optometrists will make reference to this. However, at the commencement of the benefit arrangements and until agreement is reached on any other low income groups, eligible pensioners and dependants will be the only persons entitled to optometric al consultations at no direct cost to themselves. It is hoped, of course, that participating optometrists will also choose to direct bill for other patients. </para>
          <para>Another matter which was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> was the special arrangements provided for isolated areas- those areas in which there is no optometrist in practice. Clause 18 of the Bill seeks to insert a new section 129A, which would empower the Minister to make special arrangements. The provision flows from the present practice in Australia whereby a number of optometrists, who have been referred to as &#39;visiting optometrists&#39;, visit outlying areas periodically. Higher charges necessarily have been made to offset the additional costs involved, and this of course is one of the many burdens that people living in isolated areas have to suffer. Because of the requirement under the benefit proposal that the fees charged by participating optometrists be no higher than the negotiated schedule fees it is considered necessary that special arrangements be made to ensure the continued provision of such services on a satisfactory basis without higher charges to the persons living in isolated areas. </para>
          <para>Because of the wide variations in the existing arrangement and the need for more detailed information in relation to individual visiting optometrists, the clause provides in broad terms for the Minister for Social Security to make special arrangements as necessary in relation to the provision of such services. It is considered that the most suitable approach would be along the lines of payments outside of the benefit arrangements to participating optometrists approved for the purposes of these arrangements that are designed to reimburse all or an agreed proportion of the reasonable expenses applicable to rural visits. Per capita payments appear to be impracticable at this stage, but it is envisaged that arrangements will be made to ensure that the payments are reasonably related to the number of patients seen. </para>
          <para>We propose that any participating optometrist who seeks to obtain payments under the special arrangement will need to apply to the Department and provide details of his practice in this regard over the past 12 months or 2 years. Information would be needed, for example, in relation to such matters as the costs incurred, the overhead expenses and so on. Consideration will then be given to the particular arrangements to apply in those cases, which will be periodically reviewed by the Department. Payment of the appropriate amounts will be made by the Health Insurance Commission. Obviously those arrangements will have to be made in consultation with the Australian Optometric al Association, as the representative of the optometrists, because it would be very difficult to lay down a hard and fast rule. In fact it would be very difficult indeed to define what is an isolated area because there may be some areas that are not strictly speaking isolated but that do not have a resident optometrist. Problems could well arise in that respect. That matter also will have to be looked into. </para>
          <para>As far as the reviewing of fees for optometric al consultations is concerned, it was said by me in my second reading speech that the Optometric al Services Committees of Inquiry and the Optometric al Services Review Tribunals are to have similar roles and are to be established and function similarly to the Medical Services Committees of Inquiry and the Medical Services Review Tribunals already authorised by the Health Insurance Act. In relation to the review of the fees charged by participating optometrists, the Bill provides for benefits for services by optometrists who enter into undertakings with the Australian Government, one of the terms of which is that the consultation fees charged will not exceed those included in Schedule 1 of the Health Insurance Act. It is envisaged that the fees will be reviewed annually with the next review taking effect from 1 January 1976. </para>
          <para>I come now to a matter which was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume,</inline> that is, the question of the orthotist. At present orthotist are not registered under any of the laws of the country, although the practice is for them to be registered with, I think it is, the Australian Orth optic Board. Certainly the introduction of a new benefit such as this does impinge upon other areas of activity. The fact is that there are some 135 orthotist practising in Australia, according to my information, and a substantial majority of them are either employed on a salaried basis or in fact sponsored by ophthalmologists. I am not overlooking the problem that is involved here. I can see that there is a problem. But I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop,</inline> that until such time as we do have a legal registration of orthotist it is going to be very difficult to overcome some of the problems that are involved in the payment of benefits to them. But certainly I would be happy to receive any suggestions from anyone as to how these difficulties- if there are indeed difficulties can be overcome because I recognise the anomaly that is involved in some benefits being paid to some people and not being paid to others. </para>
          <para>I do not wish to speak any longer on this measure. I hope that I have answered- I have endeavoured to do so- the questions that honourable senators have put to me during the debate. I would be most anxious to hear from them, from the Australian Optometric al Association and from any other interested person any criticisms that they may have of the operation of this aspect of the national health scheme or any suggestions that they can make for its improvement. </para>
          <para>I appreciate that the Liberal Party has been concerned about this matter and has had various proposals as to how these benefits should be introduced. But if I might just introduce one partisan note in concluding my remarks, despite the attention which the Liberal Party has given to this matter it is in fact the Australian Labor Party Government which has brought about the introduction of the benefits. We did not just talk about the matter; we did not just study the matter; we have in fact introduced benefits for optometric al treatment within the national health scheme. I take it that the people of Australia will be aware of the role that we have played in this. </para>

            <para>The Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill 1975 has come to us from the other place. I am not sure of its track record but I think it has been before us on a number of occasions. You will remember, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that the matter with which the Bill is concerned is a matter upon which there was a division of opinion in the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review. On that occasion there was a recommendation that such a Bill be introduced. I rise simply to remind the Senate of a most formidable dissent from the recommendation on that occasion which is manifested in the record of my vote. But this really is not a matter in relation to which I have been entrusted with any responsibility on this occasion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> who has carriage of this matter has now joined the Senate. I have said all that is important for me to say, that is, that it is a thoroughly wrong proposition that the Senate should be submerged in House of Representatives elections. We should stand on our own merits, and I hope that the Senate will support the attitude it has taken previously. </para>

            <para>I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> for filling in for me and I apologise to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and to the Senate for not being here at the appointed time. The Opposition will oppose the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill 1975. The Bill falls into a pattern of attacks on the Senate which has typified this Government. Only 12 months ago the people rejected this proposal out of hand and I put to the Senate that the people have already had their say. They expressed their opinion on 1 8 May, I think it was, last year. Because of the hatred of the Senate by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> the people are again to be asked to give their opinion. I put to the Senate that this is a waste of the Parliament&#39;s time; it is a waste of the Senate&#39;s time; it is a waste of the electors&#39; time, and it is a waste of the electors&#39; money. We oppose this legislation because we do not believe that this wastage should occur for the second time in 12 months. We oppose this legislation because it is another attempt by the Prime Minister to destroy the Senate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If the referendum which the legislation proposes were passed by some freak mischance, it would effectively destroy the capacity of the Senate to act as it now does. It would be the first step towards placing all power in the hands of the House of Representatives and therefore in the hands of the Prime Minister for the time being. It would destroy the Parliament as we have known the Parliament since 1900. It is the Senate, and at present the Senate alone, which stands between the complete arbitrary power which is being sought by this Government and the individual rights and liberties of the Australian people. This Bill is an attempt to destroy the only effective watchdog, the only effective check, on the abuse of power in this country. What the Government is seeking is to bind the Constitution, and thereby to bind the Senate, to 2 terms of the House of Representatives. </para>
          <para>Yet strangely enough the Government places no limit on the duration of the term of the House of Representatives. Conceivably, a government could go back to the people time and time again, forcing election after election, until it won control of the Senate. It could keep doing so until it destroyed the watch-dog and turned it into a rubber stamp stacked with its own unquestioning supporters. That is what the Prime Minister wants. He wants a Senate that does his bidding without question. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I put it to you and to my colleagues that he will go to any lengths to achieve it. Since this Government came to power it has been carrying on an unceasing campaign against the Senate. I think one is entitled to ask why. I answer that it is because this chamber has insisted upon its right- a right provided for it in the Constitution- to review the Government&#39;s legislation and avoid unnecessary and unfair legislation being foisted upon the people. </para>
          <para>Whilst the Government rants and raves about obstruction, the fact is that the Senate has never used its power capriciously. Its opposition to Government legislation comes about because the legislation is either bad- because it hurts the people- or because it is a bid to keep the Government in power, which would equally hurt the people. There is not one Bill that the Senate has held up that would provide any real benefits to the people of Australia, but there have been plenty of Bills which would have disadvantaged them. In fact, far from obstructing, the Senate has helped. One need only recall when the Government tried to rush its trade practices laws through the Parliament, and the Senate, quite rightly, asked and insisted that the law be deferred pending review. What happened? The Government came back with more than 100 amendments to its own legislation. The Senate &#39;s action allowed the Government time to discover the inequities it was about to put on the statute book. That is only one example of how the Senate has used its power responsibly. There are plenty of others. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister objects to the Senate having a 6-year term. The fact is that half the Senate must face the people every 3 years. Its membership is constantly up-dated. It is often more in touch with community thinking than is the House of Representatives. For example, there will be an election for half of the Senate some time within the next 12 months. The Senators who take their places here on 1 July 1976 will be more responsive to the needs of the people, more aware of the attitudes of the community, more anxious to ensure that the people&#39;s wishes are carried out and more charged with a mandate, if there is such a thing, than are the members of the House of Representatives elected on 18 May 1974. To that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> wishes to put an end. He wants to tie the Senate to the House of Representatives. He wants to make sure that its membership mirrors that of the Lower House. He wants to deny the people their right to express their opinion of the Government at frequent intervals. He wants a rubber stamp, a lame duck and a tame dog. In fact, he just wants to get his own way. </para>
          <para>There is a simple way for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> to get the situation he wants without holding a referendum if he thinks it is so important that the elections for both Houses should be held on the same day. He could bring the House of Representatives back into step with the Senate. When the next half Senate election is due, he could take out the House of Representatives and put the fate of his Government on the line. But why does he not do that? </para>

But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> does not really want that. He wants the right to call an election when he wants it. He wants to go to the people when the climate is favourable. That is the real reason for this referendum. The Prime Minister fears serving a full 3-year term, because at the end of 3 years the Government would be as unpopular as it is now, and the Prime Minister knows it. He wants the right to go to the people after producing a popular but irresponsible Budget. He wants to con the people, make himself out to be Father Christmas and then have an election when the polls say the people like him. He wants to keep the timing in his own hands. If this referendum were carried the Prime Minister would be given that absolute right. This is another way of rigging the electoral system in Labor&#39;s favour. </para>
            <para>The present system ensures that for Senate elections at least a part of the Parliament must face the electorate at a fixed time, and that means that governments have to be doing a good job or they pay the price. The people are given a proper chance to express their will. Prime Ministers are in part denied the opportunity to put themselves at risk in the most favourable circumstances. The people were alert to all these dangers last May. They are still aware of them. They rejected the Prime Minister&#39;s first attempt to interfere with the proper running of the Parliament and the proper method of electing its members. They will do so again. We will oppose this Bill and will vote against it. We will oppose the referendum when it is put to the people and we are certain that the people will vote against it. We are quite certain that the people of Australia have a far greater affection for the Senate, as it is constituted at the moment, than do our opponents opposite. In no circumstances will the electors of Australia see their sole watchdog taken away from them so that this Government can exercise its arbitrary, centralist, socialist power from Canberra. </para>

            <para>It is rather fitting that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> should have finished his address with one of those stereotyped cliches of which the Opposition is so fond- a reference to arbitrary, centralist, socialist powers- when he is ostensibly putting a case against a proposition which has nothing to do with centralism, socialism or the exercise of arbitrary power. The Bill is quite explicitly designed to ensure that if the Opposition in the </para>

          <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline>understandably, did not really speak about the Bill at all because he does not have a valid argument to put against it. He attempted to put a case to justify the existence of the Senate. Be that as it may, that case has nothing to do with the piece of legislation which is before the chamber. He also alleged that the Senate has never abused its power. Obviously the people rejected that opinion in May of last year. The real crux of the Opposition&#39;s objection to this piece of legislation is the same as the Opposition &#39;s objection to every electoral reform which has been put before this Senate since I became a member of it. The Opposition does not trust the people. It does not want to give the people an opportunity to elect a government or a parliament under any fair electoral system. It insists that the electoral laws be rigged in favour of its component parties and that that system be retained forever mainly of course through electoral gerrymandering to ensure that the votes of Australians have a grossly unequal value in a way that advantages the Opposition parties and in this case to retain for the Senate the right to force a government in the House of Representatives to an election through rejecting a Supply Bill without submitting the senators who forced that election to the judgment of the electors themselves. I see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> is amused. I daresay that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> would be afraid to face the electors again, and in particular might be afraid to run for another pre-selection ballot in Queensland, as I understand that at least one member of the Opposition Parties from Queensland has made a significant move, for the very basest of reasons, to displace <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> from the very favourable position he occupied on the ticket. </para>

              <para>I remember it very clearly. If I have deviated substantially from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> said, I will be very happy to withdraw it later on. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> said is that the Government is conspiring to acquire a long list of double dissolution Bills upon which it could call an election, submit those Bills to a Joint Sitting of the Houses and thereby, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott,</inline> change the whole political fabric of Australia in a way which was never intended. It is pleasing to note that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> took it for granted that if there should be another double dissolution it would be followed by a Joint Sitting, following a Labor victory. It is perhaps even more enlightening to discern the underlying political morality behind that statement. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> was really saying was that it would be totally unacceptable for a Joint Sitting of the Parliament to enact a number of Bills following an election, the subject of which was those very Bills which a Joint Sitting would enact. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> could not have put more plainly the central fact that the Opposition does not trust the people in any fair election, will not under any circumstances tolerate a fair election and will not accept the judgment of the people once it has been given. </para>

              <para>Senator Walsh, a Labor senator from Western Australia, made the point that it is a correct principle to accept the judgment of the people. What an irony of fate that he chooses this Bill to illustrate that point because exactly 13 months ago the people of Australianowhere more strongly than in Western Australiasaid they would not have a bar of this Bill. The only people who are not accepting the judgment of the people of Australia are members of the Labor Party, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh.</inline> So, indeed: Physician, cure thyself. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>Let us remind ourselves of what this Bill is about. It is a Bill which seeks to resubmit to the people of Australia a proposition which they rejected resoundingly 12 months ago. That is quite clear. It is a Bill which seeks to make it compulsory forever afterwards that the House of Representatives and the Senate elections be held on the one day. Any senator coming from one of the small States who ties himself basically to this device is, indeed, in dereliction of his duty to the States. That applies to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe,</inline> who is attempting to interject, and to Queensland. The simple situation is that the Australian Constitution was formed on the basis that the less populous States- Tasmania, Western Australia, South Australia in particular, and Queenslandwould only come into a Commonwealth if there were a Senate and if the constitution of that Senate were as provided in the Australian Constitution. Any senator who gets up and seeks to destroy the quality of the Senate in this way ought to be defeated in his own State. </para>
            <para>I want to remind honourable senators what is proposed. Incidentally, the only argument that is used for the proposal is that it will save money and save time. I suggest that to save money we ought to put it on a simple basis: Two overseas journeys by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> equals the cost of one separate Senate election. This is the situation: It is good enough for the Prime Minister to spend his time as a peripatetic Prime Minister overseas - </para>

              <para>I will. I understand that the Minister for Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> repeatedly referred in argument to the cost of a Senate election being relevant. I was talking about the cost of an election and equating it to the cost of 2 overseas trips of the Prime Minister, and that is totally relevant.

            <para>When it was written 4 sections were highly pertinent. I refer, firstly, to part II, section 7, which states: </para>

              <para class="block">The senators shall be chosen for a term of 6 years . . . </para>
            </quote>
            <para class="block">There is no question of &#39;or part thereof, it is for 6 years. Section 28 states: </para>
            <quote>
              <para>Every House of Representatives shall continue for 3 years from the first meeting of the House, and no longer, but may be sooner dissolved by the Governor-General. </para>
            </quote>
            <para class="block">The first point is that the Constitution fixes a period of 6 years for the Senate and 3 years or less for the House of Representatives. Section 12 of the Constitution states: </para>
            <quote>
              <para>The Governor of any State may cause writs to be issued for elections of senators for the State. </para>
            </quote>
            <para class="block">Section 32 states: </para>
            <quote>
              <para>The Governor-General in Council may cause writs to be issued for general elections of members of the House of Representatives. </para>
            </quote>
            <para class="block">The Constitution sees the Senate as a States house. It says that there must be a series of 6 elections for the Senate, the writs for which are issued by the Governor of each State. Therefore the Senate should be considered quite separately from the House of Representatives. </para>
            <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> saw fit to criticise our arguments, I remind him that the lesser populated States, notably Tasmania, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland, have an absolutely de vested interest in this situation. All the Labor senators, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh,</inline> subscribe to a Party platform which seeks to abolish the Senate. If the Senate were abolished <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh&#39;s</inline> State of Western Australia would be almost unprotected in the other place. New South Wales and Victoria between them could command 79 of the 127 votes in the House of Representatives. Western Australia would be swamped. Tasmania, which has only 5 seats in the House of Representatives, would be swamped in every way. It gets a rough enough time now. What would it get if it had no recourse to the Senate? In the Senate the small States have equality with the large States. The proposition that we are considering comes from a government which seeks to abolish the Senate. What irony! A government which wants to abolish the Senate now puts in the Senate ministers with five of the major portfolios. If the Government has contempt for the Senate and wants to abolish the Senate, why do we find the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Social Security, the Minister for Labor and Immigration, the Minister for Agriculture and the Special Minister of State here? That is something that we might have explained in future. </para>
            <para>This Bill is introduced for the reasons that my leader states. The aim is to deny to the people of Australia a mid-term election. If this Bill were law today there would not be an election for half the Senate during the next year. </para>

              <para>Senator Steele Hall from South Australia interjects that it would be a good thing too. Those who have an understanding of American politics know that the people of America have come to regard the holding of mid-term elections in America as a basic way of registering an opinion of their government, whether by way of recall or review. The one chance that the people of Australia will have to register their view on the Whitlam Government at this moment will occur between now and 30 June next year when they will have the opportunity to vote at an election for half the Senate, unless some other event of major importance supervenes. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>The aim of the Government&#39;s proposal is to destroy that opportunity; the aim is always to twin the two together so that the Senate becomes a mirror image of the House of Representatives. I wonder if those honourable senators who interjected would want the Senate to be a mirror image of the House of Representatives? If it were so, if it were always so, and the Senate were simply a reflection, then of course there might be an argument for the claim that the Senate would be redundant. The one way in which there can be a Senate which is independent and which reflects more readily the views of the people than the House of Representatives does at times is to have from time to time a staggering of the elections. That is what is happening now. The Senate, by having a half Senate election in the course of the next eight to ten months will be more contemporary in its outlook and more contemporary in registering the vote of the people than will be the House of Representatives. After all, it should be understood that the Senate is elected by compulsory, general, universal franchise of the people in exactly the same way as the House of Representatives and therefore gets a mandate of its own. It gets a particular mandate; it gets a special mandate from the smaller or less populous States. The people of those States can speak out on that occasion and assert themselves. </para>
            <para>This is indeed what the Government is now seeking to stop. This Bill seeks simply to ensure that in the future the Senate will not be allowed to be other than a rubber stamp. That having once before been put to the people of Australia, the people of Australia said: &#39;We do not want the Senate to be a rubber stamp. We want the Constitution to carry on as it has before. We want the right of the Senate to have separate elections midterm elections, if that be- to persist. We do not want a compulsory twinning. We want the Senate to have an independence of its own, to have a character of its own and not to be destroyed&#39;. This is what this debate is about. It is utterly pertinent that this debate should occur in this atmosphere- an atmosphere where the importance of the small States is very much before the Australian public, as it is today. In common with my Leader, I reject this legislation. </para>

            <para>At least the Opposition Parties are consistent in their view on electoral matters, and that is to oppose all electoral alterations and changes which are suggested and which they have not made themselves. Whether or not merit exists for the proposals, they are to be opposed. One is not of course to take the Opposition&#39;s argument seriously. If one did take it seriously one would become very exasperated trying to find any logic in the disjointed opposition which is put to this and other proposals. I notice however that the spokesmen for the Opposition are generally very smart with little phrases. In relation to another Bill- a redistribution Bill- but particularly to the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill, there are 3 phrases which have come through. They are: &#39;mirror image&#39;, &#39;map makers&#39; and &#39;compulsory twinning&#39;. I suppose all of those phrases sound very erudite, very learned, but their use is only a fancy cover-up for a lack of logic and a lack of principle. </para>

              <para>I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> has interjected on the side of instability in Australian politics. The people did reject this matter at the election caused last year by the Opposition when they cut right across what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> said about having Senate elections every 6 years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> voted against 6-year Senate elections as the pragmatic method of forcing aU senators to stand for election last year, regardless of their 6-year term. So I do not know why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> argued for a 6-year term; he voted against it. I make those comments by way of answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> &#39;s interjection. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>The situation has changed dramatically since the election last year. Following the election the then Leader of the Opposition said, as honourable senators know very well, that he did not lose the election, he just did not get the numbers. From then on, week after weary week, he threatened Australia with yet another election. There could not have been a more unstable political situation than that which existed in Australia following the double dissolution last year. The public of Australia got thoroughly fed up with the instability in Australian politics. If ever there was a lesson for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> it existed in the removal of his former Leader on the very basis that he constantly threatened instability in Australian politics. The Australian public does not want instability; it does not want elections every 18 months. If the people were asked to vote again, on issues shorn of the deception which the Liberal and National Country Parties used to support their opposition to this matter last year, they would vote yes. I do not think they Will vote yes, because I think the Liberal and National Country Parties would use the same sorts of arguments again, although they will find it more difficult next time. They will not be able to cloud their opposition by a general opposition to 3 other proposals, as the issues were so clouded and generally amalgamated last year. It will be a simple question, and I should like to think that those on our side of poetics who do oppose this Bill would use honest answers, but I do not expect they will. </para>
            <para>No doubt there are scripts remaining in a drawer in the office of some member of the media somewhere in Australia which would show the deception used last year by the Opposition in opposing the proposal, and I challenge honourable senators opposite to produce those scripts and say that they were not deceptions. They were. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> used them again today when he said that putting the elections in phase is part of an act to destroy the Senate, a part of the Prime Minister&#39;s attempt to get at the Senate, that it is wrong, after the example of the instability to which I have referred, to put the question again. The Liberal Party certainly acted in the face of a leader who would not give stability to its politics, and I suggest that the Australian public also might want to take action which will establish stability in Australian politics. There has been a very real result from the new stability that has emerged, on which the new Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> should be congratulated. He said that he will not defeat the Government by defeating the Budget, and that is a promise he made again on the weekend. So the Government knows from that public promise given by the Leader of the Opposition that its Budget will not be defeated. </para>

              <para>It has got to govern, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> says, and it is governing better since last week. It has removed two of the greatest obstacles to sensible and decent government in Australia. They were the 2 Ministers who were replaced- the former Treasurer, who would not help govern Australia by guiding the various departments in a proper financial and managerial sense, and a Minister who would not support, actively and properly, wage indexation in Australia. The Government was able to move effectively against those Ministers simply because it knows it has a tenure of office. For an Opposition to say to a government at any time of crisis that it is going to force an election every 1 8 months is a crime against Australia. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> made a plea, as I understood him, for honesty in argument and for responsibility in government. I am surprised that he should have used those arguments and announced that he will support this Bill because it is quite clear that if responsibility in government is at issue, it is the Government which is lacking in responsibility. This measure was before the people of Australia in 1 974 and the people of Australia resoundingly defeated it by a majority of approximately 250 000 votes, yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> apparently regards that decision as of such little consequence that he feels a contrary view can be advanced and urged as the responsible course. That is not denying to him his right to put the point of view which he espouses, but I do not suggest it is a proper attitude to condemn those whose attitudes have been endorsed by the people and those who are still maintaining those attitudes. What are the arguments which have been advanced by the Government to bring forward this Bill once again? The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)-</inline> I imagine that he is the best exponent of what the Government&#39;s reasons are- said when he introduced this Bill for the first time in February this year: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>This Bill proposes to alter the Constitution to ensure that Senate elections are always held at the same time as elections for the House of Representatives . . . The proposal is clearly one that has great appeal to the electorate. My Government is of the view that it is of such importance and merit that it should again be put to the people. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What is its importance? He does not state. What is its merit? He does not state it. As for it having great appeal to the people of Australia, the facts are against him. For a referendum to be carried in this country the Constitution requires that a majority of the people should support it and that a majority of States should support it. At the last election, as I have said, this proposal was overwhelmingly defeated and a deficit of some 250 000 votes is not some small margin. There was only one State in which people supported the measure and that was in New South Wales. In Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland the proposal was defeated and in the last 3 mentioned States it was overwhelmingly defeated. In those circumstances how is it that the Government believes that an argument which was so devoid of merit to the Australian people is likely to prevail on a second occasion? On what justification does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> claim to be a democrat in the way in which he condemns the Opposition Parties for our apparent paucity of argument and inconsistency of argument when he ignores the fact that the Opposition&#39;s viewpoint was clearly supported by the people of Australia? I suggest that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said- he was supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick-</inline> is an argument which clearly has merit and in terms of past results electoral backing behind it. </para>
          <para>There is another aspect of this which is the prime reason why I rose to speak, that is, the way in which this Bill seeks to undermine the bicameral system and to weaken the power of the Senate. I refer again to what the Prime Minister said when he introduced this Bill. He said: </para>
          <para>The intention of the men who drafted our Constitution and the expectation of those who voted for it was that every 3 years there should be an election for the House of Representatives and half the Senate. </para>
          <para class="block">He does not give any authority for that. He does not refer to any of the convention debates and he does not explain how it is that suddenly in 1975 he can divine an intention which is not to be found in any of the prior writings. In fact there is no such intention in the Constitution. The Senate is to be composed of members elected for a 6-year term and half the senators are to retire every 3 years. That is a fixed rule. That certainly is what the framers of the Constitution intended. They did not have any such intention with regard to the House of Representatives. In the case of the House of Representatives, all they said was that there must be an election every 3 years, but they left it on the basis that it could occur much more frequently because the Westminster system gives to the Governor-General a power to dissolve the lower House on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day. That is a practice which has grown up and has been acknowledged over the years in this country. There is no basic proposition of the character which the Prime Minister enunciated. </para>
          <para>We in the Senate have maintained a view that the Senate should have the independence which the constitutional provisions currently give to it and which this Bill, if carried into law in the way it is framed, would deny. The Senate is an integral part of the bicameral system which the Liberal and Country Parties support. A bicameral system is supported because it enables a second chamber to review, to amend and, if appropriate, to reject legislation of the first House. It is a brake on hasty action and it is a second judgment on legislation. For these functions to be properly performed the second chamber should not be a duplicate or a rubber stamp of the first chamber. The acceptability of this approach is assisted by other things which we find in the Constitution; for example, direct election by the people on as representative a basis as the first chamber. This is secured in the case of the Senate by proportional representation on a Statewide electorate. The fact is that the Senate is as democratically elected as is the House of </para>
          <para class="block">Representatives and it has, subject to the Constitution, the same rights as the democratically elected lower House. </para>
          <para>Another aspect is that there is an ability in the Senate to reject or amend Bills without being required to submit to an election unless, of course, the particular circumstances arise in which, after a 3 months lapse, the Senate reaffirms its amendment or rejection and a double dissolution occurs, as specifically provided for by the Constitution. Another aspect is that the fixed 6-year term of senators, contrasted with the term not exceeding 3 years for members of the House of Representatives, will last as long as the House itself is not dissolved. The fixed 6-year term is the distinguishing characteristic of senators and it is that fixed term which gives them the ability to exercise the functions which the Constitution gives to them without regard to the considerations which from time to time can affect the members of the House of Representatives. If these general conditions did not exist, the ability of the Senate to be an effective second chamber and more than a duplicate or rubber stamp of the House of Representatives would be seriously impaired. </para>
          <para>Another point which can be made is that a Senate election for half the Senate every time the House of Representatives went to an election would mean that the Senate result would be likely to reflect the voting result for the House of Representatives. This may be a desirable result because it may offer the hope that the Government will not be frustrated by perpetual opposition in the second chamber. I think that is the basic reason the Government is putting this proposal forward. The Government is putting it forward because it wants to avoid, if it can, the prospect that an upper House, in its own judgment, will frustrate the legislation which the lower House has put forward. I stress that point because I think that for the greater part of the period of the Liberal-Country Party Government, certainly the last seven or eight years of such Government, it did not have a majority in the upper House, yet that Government learned to live with the fact that there was a second chamber which did not always agree with what the lower House was providing. </para>
          <para>Nevertheless, the Government of the country was not frustrated. The Government of the country is not currently being frustrated. The Prime Minister cannot in one breath say that this has been a most productive autumn session of the Parliament and at the same time justify his condemnation of the Senate as a frustrating upper House. He cannot have it both ways. The fact is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said, that no legislation which confers benefit on the people of Australia has been rejected by the Senate. The continuity of the Senate means that if a change of government in the lower House occurs the effects of that change will not be too drastic and in any event can be tempered by a Senate effectively reviewing legislation while the electorate decides whether the change is to be endorsed for a longer period. </para>
          <para>In 1931 when, as a result of Senate action, there was a House of Representatives election, the change of Government resulting from the 1929 election was not endorsed. In 1951 the change made in 1949 was endorsed, and following the 1974 election I suggest that the people are biding their time. They endorsed the Labor Government in power in the lower House but denied to the Labor Government a majority in the upper House. It seems to me that a fair interpretation of that electoral verdict is that people are still biding their time as to whether they will give the Labor Party a complete mandate or take away the mandate which they gave it in 1972. But this breathing period can be and ought to be regarded as being a safeguard for the better working of representative democracy. But possibly the real question is whether it should be mandatory that every time there is a House of Representatives election there should be an election of half the Senate. The function of the House of Representatives as the House of government and the function of the Senate as a House of review surely indicate that it should not be mandatory. </para>
          <para>Why should a desire for a mandate, for any one of the many reasons which may prompt it, leading to a dissolution of the House of government also involve a dissolution of the House of review? The terms for senators could be reduced to less than 18 months by penal dissolutions of the House of Representatives emanating entirely from internal differences within the House of Representatives. One can instance the events which occurred- it seems an awfully long time ago- in 1929 within 7 months of the coming together of the House of Representatives. It is unnecessary, it is expensive and it is a weakening of the Senate&#39;s independence and therefore a weakening of the efficacy of the bicameral system to require in all circumstances that every time there is a dissolution of the House of Representatives, notwithstanding the reasons which have prompted it, half the Senate should be elected too. </para>
          <para>The present position which in political terms leads to the pressure for simultaneous elections arises from the fact that Senate elections are held at times different from election times of the House of Representatives. If it is desired to bring these together, we repeat, there is no need for a constitutional amendment. It is acknowledged that within the next 12 months, between 1 July and 30 June next year there must be an election for half the Senate under the terms of the Constitution. If the Prime Minister is only concerned to bring the House of Representatives and the Senate elections into line- without there being a constitutional mandatory provision that it should happen on every occasion into the distant future- he has a ready-made opportunity of which he can avail himself. At any time within the next 12 months when he holds the half Senate election he can hold an election for the House of Representatives. One might go further. He can hold a double dissolution election and the result which he seeks to obtain can be secured in that way. </para>
          <para>Why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall-</inline> and I conclude on the aspect on which I started- regards that as an unsatisfactory solution or as in some way an undesirable course to follow, I am at a loss to understand. But I certainly feel that the argument against what the Government has proposed is an argument which has received the overwhelming endorsement of the people. That, for no other reason, ought to justify the stand which the Opposition is expressing today. No reason has been advanced- except unsubstantiated and detailed assertions that this is a matter of importance and of merit- to explain why within 12 months after the people have given their verdict, the matter is being brought forward again. The Government ought to explain not only to the Parliament but also to the people of Australia why this is being done. The Opposition will be consistent in its rejection. </para>

            <para>in reply- The arguments in relation to this Constitutional Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill have been canvassed quite extensively in the Parliament over the past few months, and I do not wish to go over again the points which have been raised in the general debate. It would be much better if we were to crystallise the points which have been raised during this afternoon&#39;s debate and try to analyse why the Opposition is opposing this legislation. There seem to be 2 points on which it bases its opposition. Essentially, we are told that this is a move to create centralised control in Canberra. We have arguments about the abolition of the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Senate. This is completely irrelevant in this debate. This Bill has nothing to do with the abolition of the Senate. These are the sorts of red herrings which are drawn across the argument for the sake of confusing anyone who is listening. It seems that not too many people listen to the Senate, anyway. In fact, I look at the public gallery on this day and I find about a dozen people sitting there. If this were the House of Representatives, the gallery would be full. It seems that the average Australian does not care very much what happens in the Senate. </para>

              <para>I did not interrupt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> when he was speaking. I know the honourable senator does not like it when someone argues against him, but he might extend me the courtesy of listening to what I have to say. It is said that if we were to pass this legislation the bureaucrats would rise up, centralised control would emanate from Canberra for the purpose of creating a rubber stamp, and we would be living under some form of dictatorship from the House of Representatives. But is it not a fact that for over 50 years since Federation, with the exception of 1 929, that is exactly the system which has operated? I do not think anyone would suggest that for the first 50 years of the existence of this country we lived under a dictatorship simply because the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives were held coincidentally. Would anyone put up that contention? I am sure that if they tried to do so there is not an Australian who would believe them. Right up to 1953 it was the accepted routine and procedure that elections would be held concurrently. That is what this legislation is trying to do. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>The other point is that there should be elections for the Senate in between general elections in order to gauge more accurately the feeling of the people. How does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> reconcile that argument which has been advanced by the Opposition while he extols the virtue of the 6-year term which, under the Constitution, is mandatory for a senator? He cannot have it both ways. Is it not obvious that every 3 years a government ought to go to the people? Consistent with what the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> has said, during this debate, reference has been made to the fact that a government ought to be allowed to exercise its mandate for that 3-year period. I think the majority of Australians want that, and that it was the point <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> was trying to get across. The average Australian does not want instability in government. When a government is elected on a platform of a 3-year program it has a right to implement its policies. </para>
            <para>The other argument is that this legislation was put to the Australian people only 12 months ago and was rejected and it should not be put up again. Twelve months ago the Australian people also rejected the Opposition by about the same number of votes. Are we to assume that the Opposition has now opted out of Australian politics and will not put itself forward at any election that may occur between now and 1977? Of course it is not opting out. I think the Government would even be prepared to withdraw the legislation if the Opposition were to give the undertaking that it was not prepared to put itself up for re-election. I am not putting that as a serious proposition, but I am drawing an analogy with the fallacious argument that is advanced that because the referendum was put to the people 12 months ago therefore it should not be put again. </para>
            <para>The Government was asked to give one example of legislation that has been rejected by the Senate and which would have been of any value to the Australian people. I will give one example- the legislation concerning the National Investment Fund. That was one of the most forward-looking and beneficial pieces of legislation that this country has seen for a long time. It was designed to ensure the formation of capital in this country by Australians to assist the development of Australian industry. That legislation was rejected by the Liberal-Country Party Opposition. These sorts of things will continue while the Opposition adopts its present position. </para>
            <para>Does not any political Party, whether it be the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or the National Country Party, go to an election with a specific purpose of winning a majority not only in the House of Representatives but also in the Senate? Is that a crime? The objective of any political Party when it goes to the people is to obtain that majority. Yet that is the very argument which, we are told, condemns this legislation. It is a contradiction. The whole purpose of this Bill is to bring the elections together so that the Aus.tralian people will not have to suffer successive elections which serve no good purpose either for themselves or for the Parliament. It is true that $2m is not a fortune but nevertheless that amount of money is being spent where it is unnecessary to spend it. This legislation would be good for Australia. It would take us back to the situation that obtained for over 50 years. The Australian people would want it that way and if common sense were to prevail in the Senate today that is the way they would have it. </para>

            <para> This Bill which seeks to create the National Gallery is supported in principle by the Liberal and National Country Parties. It represents our on-going commitment to the arts which, in respect of a national gallery, began in August 1963. It will be recalled that in 1965, the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, established the National Art Gallery Committee of Inquiry which was chaired by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Daryl</inline> Lindsay. The Committee reported in March 1966. The difficulty in siting the Gallery was one of the problems which needed to be overcome by the Committee. The Interim Council was appointed in 1968, and since them we have seen steady progress towards the creation of a national art gallery. During the 12 intervening years there has been a steady build-up in our national collection of works of art. I believe that the pursuit of excellence in visual arts at home and by our own artists living abroad has been an objective of governments during that time. For that reason we are pleased to support the Bill which creates the National Gallery. It is consistent with our own current policy on the arts in Australia. We believe in the development of an Australian cultural identity which is distinctive, but which reflects the full scope and intensity of international cultural influences and our own social and historical heritage. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am dealing with this Bill for the Opposition on behalf of the shadow Minister for community development, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> who has had a great deal of interest in this Bill and has done a deal of consulting with art galleries throughout Australia and elsewhere to seek their views on the establishment which is provided for in this Bill. A Liberal-National Country Party government would provide a national stimulus to the development of the arts in all its forms. As a matter of policy, we would promote the pursuit of artistic excellence and freedom of expression in all forms of art. Equally, we would encourage the growing appreciation of the arts within the Australian community, because we believe that cultural expression and appreciation are important elements in the development of a vibrant and imaginative but cohesive society. We have an extensive policy with regard to the development of the arts in this country. Details of this policy have already been released. We see the pursuit of our objectives as vitally important and we believe that these objectives are supported in principle by the legislation which we are considering today. Our support for this legislation was given to establish the principle that practitioners of the arts must undertake the primary responsibility for artistic judgment in the disbursement of public funds for the promotion of the arts and that individual art forms, as far as possible, must be assessed and fostered in their own right and also that there must be full accountability to the Parliament for the expenditure of public funds on the arts. I believe that nothing less would be accepted by the Australian people. </para>
          <para>One point on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> found unanimity in the consultations which he undertook is that, if the National Gallery idea is an attempt to kill off in any way the galleries in the States and the regional centres of Australia instead of blending and making widely available all our resources and talents, then the arts will suffer, and for that the present Government will have to accept responsibility. It was of interest to us that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> in his second reading speech used these words: </para>
          <para>Honourable members will be aware of my longstanding interest in a National Gallery and the Hansard record of my questions over many years stands testimony to my concern about the growth of our national collection of works of art. </para>
          <para class="block">We consider that in this area the Prime Minister has been somewhat inconsistent because apparently his interest has been confined to asking questions instead of to answering them. I had thought of seeking leave to incorporate in Hansard the Prime Minister&#39;s table of questions on the arts given to the right honourable member for Bruce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> as set out in Hansard for the House of Representatives of 8 April, but I feel that my purpose would be served if I abbreviated the matter and simply said that the Prime Minister answered a question asked by the right honourable member for Bruce by giving a chronological record of 10 questions which he had asked since 1965 with regard to the development of the arts in this country and then went on to give further information that was requested. The most important part of the information he supplied related to Australian works of art as a percentage of acquisitions from 1969 to 1975. A table which I think is of significance shows that in 1969-70 89 per cent of our acquisitions were Australian works of art, in 1970-71 the figure was 90 per cent, in 1971-72 96 per cent, in 1972-73 82 per cent, in 1973-74 77 per cent and in 1974-75 68 per cent. These figures show that there are significant Australian works of art in the national collection, but they show some disparity between the years with a declining Australian content in the national collections, particularly in the years 1973-74 and 1974-75. The Prime Minster in his second reading speech said: </para>
          <para>A novel feature of the Bill is that it provides for 2 statutory officers, the Director of the Australian National Gallery and the Secretary and Manager of the Gallery. The Director shall have overall responsibility to the Council for the running of the Gallery and its artistic direction, and the Secretary and Manager shall, under the Director, manage the day-to-day administration affairs of the Gallery and act as secretary to the Council. </para>
          <para class="block">The Prime Minister said also that this provision has been introduced to avoid the problems that have arisen so often elsewhere, where unlikely and unreasonable combinations of different expertise and experience have been demanded of the one person, usually with unfortunate results. We felt that it was necessary to pursue the Prime Minister&#39;s statement that there had been unfortunate results in the past, so we put a question to him on notice. The question and answer to it appeared in the Senate Hansard of 22 April 1975. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I seek leave to have the question and answer incorporated in Hansard. </para>

              <para>The answer to the question was incomplete. It was to our way of thinking an inconsiderate reply from someone who had alleged that he had a long-standing interest in the establishment of a national gallery. So we asked a further question on notice. We received a reply to that question on 26 May. The answer to that question did not give any further information as to the Prime Minister&#39;s concern or the unsatisfactory results that had been experienced. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>There are some other comments that we want to make about an arts policy for Australia. We trust that this Bill, along with our endeavours in other areas of the arts, will stimulate creative minds in the pursuit of cultural excellence. That hope is held alongside an awareness of the fact that the function of such a gallery is largely symbolic. It seems to us that governments, past and present, in Australia have, by their secrecy in purchasing, contributed to a resistance by the people generally to the arts. If it is only possible to negotiate reasonable prices in secrecy, then what measurement do we have that this policy has been successful in terms of value and worthwhile results? We ask: Is it not time that the Government made the purchasing guidelines known to the people of Australia? We believe that would avoid some of the controversy and resentment which has been experienced in the more recent past when costly purchases of art have been undertaken on behalf of the people of Australia. </para>

              <para>We accept that there is a need for secrecy in negotiations for the purchase of art and we understand that traditionally there is secrecy with regard to the prices that are actually paid. What we are suggesting is that the laying down of some guidelines with regard to the commissions that are given for the purchase of art on behalf of the galleries of this country would be one way in which the people would feel more fully informed about what the costs do represent when they are disclosed as public expenditure. I accept that negotiations of this kind are not dealt with publicly, but it is more in the way of what we are trying to achieve in the pursuit of excellence and balance in our collection and the effects of the public expenditure that this would need to command that has made me put forward the comment that I have made with regard to purchasing guidelines. The role of Government in Australia in the visual arts could have 3 functions. Firstly, it could have the function that was expressed by Bernard Smith in the Australian&#39; newspaper in February of this year when he said:  the National Gallery should embark upon creating a collection which is not polemic about taste but is poised to collect tested and enduring value in all areas of creative activity in the visual arts. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para class="block">That concept is something that would be important in the formulation of a national policy for the development of an art collection. I think there is time for us in this country to use that sort of approach in any future collection that we hope to establish. I think the second feature that could be taken into account is that we should take the collection to the people across Australia so that it is no longer locked up in the Prime Minister&#39;s Lodge or in Kirribilli House or in any other area where the people have a somewhat restricted opportunity to see these things. </para>
            <para>Clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill deal with the functions and the powers of the Gallery. We welcome the fact that clause 6 (1) (b) provides that the Gallery shall exhibit or make available for exhibition by others, works of art from the national collection. Clause 7 (2) (b) provides that the Gallery shall have power  to lend or hire out or otherwise deal with . . . works of art; </para>
            <para class="block">This approach to the matter is important having regard to the size of this country, the distances involved, and the fact that the national collection is truly something which belongs to the people and to which they should have as wide an access as possible. </para>
            <para>The Prime Minister was asked the following question on notice by the right honourable member for Bruce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden):</inline></para>
            <para>What percentage of works of art owned by the Government which are intended to be exhibited in the National Art Gallery has been publicly displayed in Australia since they have been acquired by the Government. </para>
            <para class="block">On 5 December 1974 the Prime Minister stated, amongst other things, in his answer </para>
            <para>Works of art from the Collection have, however, been included from time to time in exhibitions in State and regional galleries. They have also been displayed in official establishments in Australia such as Government House and The Lodge in Canberra, and Admiralty House and Kirribilli House in Sydney. </para>
            <para class="block">The display of these works of art in the official residences listed by the Prime Minister perhaps does not give the wide access to the collection that a gallery in the States or the regional centres would give. It is for this reason that I made my second point. </para>
            <para>The third point I want to make is that the National Gallery should stimulate artists within Australia. There should also be much stimulation for the neighbourhood workshop movement as a means of creating the environment and facilities in which talent can thrive. This is very much part of our attitude towards community involvement in any of the creative expressions. We would see the visual arts as coming very much within our framework of community involvement and community development. </para>

              <para>That is right. I think this is to be commended. It is very much part of the way in which the community can be enriched through the resources that are made available by government for the development of art collections and to encourage and stimulate the artists who live within this country further to develop their own talents. The approach that has been outlined in the Bill is one that essentially has our support. However, there are one or two matters to which we wish to refer and on which we seek some interpretation during the Committee stage of this Bill. But in general we welcome the Bill and the proposal which is covered by it. The Bill has the support of the Opposition Parties. </para>

            <para>The purpose of this Bill is to establish the National Gallery of Australia in the Australian Capital Territory. I am personally disappointed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> devoted so much of her speech to establishing the apparently new-found fact that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> is not infallible when it comes to matters of the arts. But be that as it may, I think I share with her the essential views she has expressed relating to the purposes of this legislation. To establish a National Gallery in Canberra, the capital of Australia, is of course consistent with the notion of Canberra as the national capital. We already have in Canberra the national Parliament, the national War Memorial, the National Library, the Australian National University and shortly we will have the High Court. It is important that recognition of the significance of the arts in the life of Australia should be symbolised likewise by the establishment of the National Gallery in Canberra. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> has pointed out, we have already 6 State galleries. Prior to 1 900 they were, of course, 6 colonial galleries. It has really taken us quite a long time as a nation to establish a National Gallery for Australia. In talking of those 6 State galleries, I share <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> &#39;s view that it would be most desirable if the Australian National Gallery worked very closely in co-operation with those 6 State galleries. I do not for a moment share her apprehension that in the &#39;Canberra-opus&#39;, which seems to be the latest successor to what used to be known by our opponents as the &#39;Red-opus&#39;, will fail to co-operate with those galleries and in some way will take them over. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think it is true to say that the establishment of the National Gallery is perhaps the most appropriate recognition of the importance of the arts in Australia and the aspirations of the Australian people to a national identity. The Gallery which is to be established is to be a body corporate and it will be presided over by a council. The functions of the Gallery are set out in clause 6 of the Bill. As we all know, already some of those functions are being performed under a very able director in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jim</inline> Mollison who has acquired for Australia some very significant works of art. Although those purchases have been the subject of some criticism and some inquiry as to whether the right prices were paid and things of that kind, I think anybody who understands the field will recognise that significant steps have already been made in establishing a significant national collection. </para>
          <para>The important point that I seek to make about the National Gallery is probably consistent with something which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> said. It is simply that by passing this legislation in the Parliament the function of the Parliament should not be seen to be at an end, but rather that we should be diligent to ensure the future activity of the Gallery not as a museum for the citizens of Canberra but as a living thing having relevance to the life of the Australian people as a whole. That, of course, involves co-operation with the State galleries. It involves travelling exhibitions and things of that kind. It involves the uses of new aspects of technology in spreading the work of the Gallery as far as possible. We can, of course, just go ahead and establish what would be another sort of national art museum in Canberra. That would be consistent with the concept of the Australian War Memorial which has been established in Canberra, but it would not be consistent with the best interests of the Australian people. </para>
          <para>One can picture the National Gallery as a sterile institution which receives pilgrims in the form of tourists and school children and other people who pile out of their Holden cars and their Pioneer buses outside the Gallery, make a quick examination of its contents and then go away having chalked up another score in their travel itinerary. Honourable senators will probably have heard the story of the American tourist visiting the Louvre in Paris and saying to the attendant at the door: &#39;Quick, where is that goddamn Mona Lisa? I am double parked&#39;. That sort of thing can, of course, happen in Canberra if the Gallery is confined to Canberra and is just a place which people visit as an institution. But the important thing, I think, is for the Gallery to use modern technology, the developments in cassette television which will shortly be upon us, and various developments of that kind to get across the message of the Gallery and to get out to the Australian people the full emphasis of what it means. I refer not only to those who may not have the opportunity of visiting Canberra but also to the sick, the aged and the impoverished who are just not able to make a visit to Canberra and inspect what might be a sort of national museum. </para>
          <para>In this regard there comes to mind particularly someone in Victoria who now lies on his sickbed, one Bruce Edward Weather head, a well-known Victorian aesthete with a lifelong devotion to the pursuit of beauty in all its forms. He lies on his sick bed today in Victoria having collided with a tree in his car, no doubt while he was listening to Beethoven&#39;s Ninth Symphony. Like someone waiting for Godot, he waits for the national compensation scheme to arrive and help him with his problems. But a man like that, who is unable to visit a gallery of this kind because of ill health, can surely have the benefits which the Gallery should provide in the form of, as I said, cassette television productions from the Gallery which can be distributed widely throughout the community. Particularly with the advent of colour television, there is the prospect of the Gallery&#39;s works being brought into every home from time to time. I do not want to discuss the various sections of the community which could benefit in that way because if I do I suppose that I will sound as though I am conducting the Hospital Half Hour session, the happy Hammond show, or something of that kind. That is not my intention. But I am concerned to see that the Aus.tralian National Gallery does fulfil a living function in the life of the Australian community, that it is just not a sterile museum in Canberra, that it is a thing which can grasp the imagination of the Australian people by its own activity and by generating activity in the artistic field throughout the community, particularly through the galleries of the various States. </para>
          <para>I make the comment in passing that we tend, even in 1975, to see works of art as having some degree of immortality. That is to say, one has a profound reverence for the works of the great masters and believes that when purchasing paintings, even in the 1970s, they should be regarded as permanent things which wil survive for as long as man can imagine and for the benefit of future generations in that form. That may not necessarily be so. Art is a very changing form and it may be that the artistic forms of the 1970s will be of a very transitory nature; that is to say, they may not be things which are bought to last. If that be so, I believe it is very important that all the facilities of the Gallery be brought to bear on the problems which I have raised, namely, dis simulating throughout the community the sorts of facilities and values which are enshrined in works of great art and which will be found in the National Gallery at Canberra when shortly, I hope, it is built. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>Speaking very briefly, I thank both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> for their contributions. I am pleased that the Opposition is not opposing this legislation. The only matter which I feel I should comment on is the availability of art exhibitions around Australia and the fact that it is not intended, of course, that these great works of art will be available to only a very small section of the community. In fact, what the Government intends is to have 3 exhibitions on tour in Australia within a very short space of time so that we can ensure that people all over Australia will benefit from seeing these works of art. I understand that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> has approved of a major exhibition of selected works from the national collection to tour all States commencing with the Adelaide Festival in March 1976. So honourable senators can be assured that the works with which this legislation deals will be seen by as many Australians as possible, which is the intention. I am sure that Australia&#39;s cultural life will benefit to a very marked degree by the passage of this legislation. </para>

            <para>I have some comments to make with regard to clause 5 and would be pleased to have a response to them. It will be seen from the Bill that clause 5(1) provides that the national collection shall be housed in the Australian Capital Territory and sub-clause (2) provides: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Nothing in the section prevents the exhibition outside the Australian Capital Territory or outside Australia of works of art from the national collection. </para>
          <para class="block">It has been brought to our attention that the wording of this clause binds the Council to house all its collection in the Australian Capital Territory except for exhibiting elsewhere. This makes us feel that the clause exempts items which cannot be moved, such as Aboriginal rock paintings or other murals or sculptures which are incorporated into a landscape. It is conceivable that a nationally important acquisition might be tied to some other location by the wish or bequest of an artist or owner or because of religious views of the community concerned, including Aborigines. The Bill includes mechanisms to make possible any arrangement required and invites techniques to achieve practical or diplomatic objectives. We wonder whether clause 5 is limiting in the way that we would be excluding the ownership of collections which were required to be housed outside the Australian Capital Territory. </para>

            <para>I was making the point that sub-clause (2) provides that the collection shall be housed in the Australian Capital Territory. We were thinking of things that may be incorporated elsewhere as pieces of sculpture but bequeathed to the national collection. We are thinking also of people who make a gift and require that it be held in a place other than the Australian Capital Territory. What we are talking about is perhaps hypothetical, but we wonder whether there needs to be some qualification of the requirements for housing within the Australian Capital Territory. </para>

            <para>May I add to the argument which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> has raised. I think that on any natural interpretation of this clause the national collection is to be housed in the Australian Capital Territory. That seems to me a very firm and fixed statement. Sub-clause (2) merely allows the exhibition outside of works of art from the national collection. I would think that that might be unduly restrictive. It may be that the Government will not choose at this stage to amend the Bill which already has passed through the House of Representatives, but it seems to me a great pity that some amendment did not come forward. I think the clause might restrict the Government from acquiring works to be part of the national collection which ought to be kept in the Northern Territory. I do not think that, on any normal interpretation, clause 5 (2) does more than allow the works to be taken from the Australian Capital Territory for exhibition. I support the comments which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> has made. </para>

            <para>I think it may be the wording of the clause that creates a problem. I would not defend completely the manner in which the clause is expressed. It does perhaps give rise to some doubt. I can only assure both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> who have spoken on it that there is certainly no intention on the part of the Government to restrict the location of exhibitions outside the Australian Capital Territory. Perhaps that is not a satisfactory answer for either honourable senator. The only way in which we could overcome the problem would be for the clause to be deferred for the purpose of amending it and re-wording it, but I do not really feel that that is necessary. Clause 5 ( 1 ) is quite clear. It says: </para>

            <para>The Opposition accepts the comments of the Minister for Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> with regard to the intent of the Bill but would like consideration to be given to the wording of the clause. We did not wish to move a formal amendment because we did not wish to impede the Bill as the other House is not in session at the present time. For this reason we raise it as a point that could require clarification. We would welcome discussion by the Minister with regard to the wording or we would accept a re-wording of the clause that would allow the National Gallery to accept as part of the national collection offers which may not be able to be housed in the Australian Capital Territory. We do not think that sub-clause (2) covers the point that we have been making with regard to the requirements that may be imposed upon location of offers for the national collection. We accept that the Aus.tralian national collection may at this stage in our history not be the best collection of all works of art in the world but we would like to think that it is the best collection of Australian works of art. For those reasons we would want to think that the National Gallery could accept bequests that may have attached to them some requirements which would tie those contributions of art to other locations. We would like to feel that the point we have been making has the consideration of the Government. </para>

            <para>The Opposition will accept that undertaking. I would now like to refer to clause 9. We see this as interesting because clause 9(1) says that the Council may resolve that the work of art be disposed of by sale, gift or destruction. We find of interest the word &#39;destruction&#39; and wondered what explanation there would be that would require the inclusion of the word &#39;destruction&#39; in such a Bill. We think there would need to be a very good reason why it should be necessary to destroy works of art and we would be interested to have the explanation as to why that word had been included. </para>

              <para>That may be the case but I would like to have an official explanation of why the word &#39;destruction&#39; has been included in clause 9. There is another matter in the same clause to which we wish to refer. In clause 9(3) the Council is required to obtain reports from two independent experts on any work being considered for disposal. We pose the thought that the Council should be expected to adopt a responsible attitude to this matter, as in all other matters of management of the National Gallery and collection. We wonder what advice of consultants would be required in addition to the wisdom that the Council undoubtedly will develop in carrying out its own responsibilities; what would be the identification of the independent experts who are envisaged in this clause and what then would be the difficulties if the two independent experts had divergent views; and whether that particular provision places a requirement on the Council that may lead to some difficulties in its own responsibilities and administration. We would appreciate it if we could have some comment on those two matters, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Temporary Chairman.</inline></para>

            <para>I understand that the . word &#39;destruction&#39; applies where a sculpture- one could imagine a fairly large object- which had become non-repairable or possibly even dangerous because of damage done to it would need to be destroyed. That is the reason for including the word &#39;destruction&#39; in the legislation. On the other matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> relating to the two independent experts, I inform senators that these would be people who are experts or specialists in the areas outside the area of the Council relating to the technical aspects of conservation and restoration. The Council would always have the final decision, based on the advice of experts. I think the legislation makes reference to the fact that the Council would need to turn to the advice of technical people. Presumably it would need to be a matter of judgment at the time as to who those persons would be. I should think it would be very difficult for the legislation to tie down specifically who the people would be. It would be a matter for the discretion of the Council. </para>

          <para class="block">Naturally the people who would be appointed to the Council would be the ones best able to determine which works should be purchased. There is, of course, the financial question. It is readily understandable that in view of the limitations on the availability of funds the Minister would need to exercise some discretion as to the actual amounts which were expended. At present on any individual work of art there is a limit of $100,000. If a work involving some millions of dollars was thought to be a fit and proper acquisition for the Gallery, obviously the Minister would need to police the decision by the Council, as part of an overall consideration of government expenditure. That is the reason for the clause being worded the way that it is. </para>

            <para>I deal now with clause 13 which relates to the membership of the Council. I draw attention to the fact that there is no mention of the basis for appointment to the Council.

          <para class="block">It would seem to me that a fairly wide qualification as to prospective members is permitted to the Council. I know the appointment of persons to any statutory body is always a difficulty, particularly to one which is involved in the area of the arts. In view of the wording of that clause one would assume that commonsense alone would dictate the need to ensure that the persons who would be appointed to such a body would be knowledgeable and competent to contribute in a particular area. I do not find the clause too restrictive. It seems to me to cover the requirements of the legislation. </para>

            <para>Yes, because they relate to one another. We are rather doubtful as to the efficiency and fairness of enabling a part time member of the Council to appoint, with the Minister&#39;s approval, a temporary  deputy  in the part time member&#39;s place. We think that this is an unusual requirement, and we would have taken as a general point of view that when a member is appointed to a council such as this the member should serve his term properly and fully or he should resign. Unless we could get a proper explanation with regard to this point we would consider this to be a provision with which we do not agree. Had we been in different circumstances I feel we would have been moving an amendment to this clause, because if we find that a part time member may appoint a  deputy,  we think that we are getting to the point in the formation of the Council where the required experience and the skill that we spoke about earlier may not be in the Council at the time it is undertaking its duties. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>Honourable senators will see that clause 17 (2) (b) provides that if a part-time member absents himself without leave from 3 consecutive meetings of the Council his appointment will be terminated in any case. With regard to the provisions of clause 17 (2) (b), the fact that a part time Council member may appoint a  deputy  seems to us to be a very wide area that is given to the membership of the Council. I simply say that if we were in different circumstances in this Committee debate we would have been seeking an amendment to this clause in the interests of having continuity of skill and experience in the membership of the Council. We would be pleased to have the response of the Minister to the need for the opportunity to be given for the appointment of a temporary  deputy  in the part time membership of the Council. </para>

            <para>I wish to make a brief comment in relation to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> &#39;s comments with regard to clause 13 (2). I think her comments are consistent with observations which the Opposition made at the time the Arts Council legislation and the Australia Council legislation- with which I had a lot of sympathy- were debated. But I should have thought that in this area, as the Minister for Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> has pointed out, the very breadth of terminology which is contained in clause 13 (2) is the most desirable terminology that one could have in relation to a Council of this kind, particularly in view of the fact that the practitioners tend to be highly nationalised and not necessarily the most objective judges of their own particular discipline. </para>

              <para>As Senator Missen points out, they are worse than lawyers. If that be possible, I would agree with that observation. In relation to the appointment of deputies of part time members, I simply make the observation that, as I understand the relevant clauses, the part time members would be extremely limited in their capacity to appoint deputies because, after all, if the part time members fail to attend 3 consecutive meetings, that is, without leave, they are removed. Their capacity to appoint part time deputies must be limited to a maximum of 2 meetings. </para>

              <para>I understand that, but in my view it still establishes a much greater limitation and control over the activities of part time members than one might think from a first reading of the clause. I make that observation because, even though the clause states specifically without leave&#39;, I think it must be taken into consideration that the members are members of an entire Council. The limitation seems to me to be much more stringent than one would think at first sight. </para>

            <para>I wish to hark back briefly to clause 13 (2) and the matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> and referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button.</inline> Looking back, in the arts in Australia we have been magnificently served by practitioners- artists in Australia who have assisted the nation through the years in the collection of works which are of inestimable value to our galleries, to our buildings, our embassies overseas and so on. I should like to stress again the high importance of clause 13(2), even though it appears to embrace the ability to have, among the 9 members, practitioners as such. I want to stress the desirability of credit being given&#39; to the work through the years of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Dargie, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Russel</inline> Drysdale and to men such as those who can do a significant service to our nation in a council such as this. I pay tribute on this occasion to what they have done in the past- </para>

            <para>I have no doubt that the Minister will give a definitive view on this in a moment. I suppose one of the things that the legislation has in mind is the sort of thing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> mentioned when she was speaking about the gallery. One would hope for an exchange of ideas, for some movement of exhibitions and personnel and so on, and that many of the people involved on a National Gallery Board of this kind would be the sort of people who would be travelling quite frequently. The four people who have just been named by the Minister- Fred Williams, Janet Dawson, Lent on Parr and Leonard French- are all engaged in teaching or painting or sculpting and each one of them, I believe, would travel overseas at least once a year. I assume it is in that sort of situation that the provision for deputies for part time members would be envisaged as being useful. I am only hazarding a guess; the Minister may have some much more refined and clearer explanation than that. </para>

            <para>The kind of Bill now before the Senate is not brought forward regularly. Every 1 8 months to 3 years we are presented with a request for an appropriation of money for the continuation of the war service land settlement scheme. Because a Bill of this kind is not a regular one and because there has been a large number of changes in the Senate since a Bill such as this was last before the Senate, I should like briefly to cover the history of war service land settlement and to point out some of the problems that the settlers are experiencing today. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The purpose of the war service settlement scheme was to establish or re-establish eligible persons on the land. It is beyond my understanding how the authorities can claim that settlers have been re-established on the land when overvalued and under-sized properties caused their liabilities to be greater than their assets. It seems to me that the authorities have nationalised large areas of land in obtaining and taking over land for this scheme. It would appear to be fairly obvious that the main consideration has been to keep their little empire intact because, according to the history of war service land settlement, it would appear that what happened to the settler has been a minor consideration. Financial arrangements were different for each method of operation. The war service land settlement scheme envisaged that the Commonwealth would bear most of the costs of the agent States while the reverse applied to States which acted as principals. The whole scheme was under the control of&#34; a Director of War Service Land Settlement who was responsible to the Minister for Post- War Reconstruction. In his second reading speech on 27 September 1945 the then Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dedman,</inline> referring to the scheme which had been implemented after the First World War, emphasised that a careful examination would have to be made of proposed land acquisition and of subsequent development to make sure that properties were of sufficient size and capable of providing a reasonable living for those who were to take up occupancy. </para>
          <para>Proposals for land acquisition were submitted to the Commonwealth giving full details including the potential use of the land. After agreement had been reached between the Commonwealth and the States concerning acquisition, the States were to proceed with plans for subdivision. After approval had been given by the Commonwealth, the States concerned would then proceed with subdivision of and improvements to the land up to the point where the land could be brought into production. Later the principal States took over full financial responsibility for war service land settlement within their own States, and the Commonwealth agreed to bear an equal share in respect of any losses which were incurred. </para>
          <para>In a second reading speech on a Bill to provide $17m for this scheme in 1956, the then Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> described the pattern of the scheme during the first 10 years of its operation. He mentioned that after a period of some years settlers could obtain freehold of their land, the actual period varying between 6 and 10 years depending on State arrangements as to when landholders could exercise their options. In New South Wales large estates were subdivided and some had irrigation facilities. A number of single unit properties were purchased under this scheme, probably in most of the States. In Victoria subdivision of large irrigation areas in the Murray Valley was undertaken. Proposals for the clearing of virgin scrub in the Otway and Wilson&#39;s Promontory areas were put in hand. The settlement scheme in Queensland was terminated after a large number of men had been settled on sugar or tobacco properties. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> described heavy clearing projects which were being undertaken in the agent States. He mentioned that in Western Australia the Rocky Gully project would provide 170 fat lamb farms from 285 000 acres of virgin forest; 48 wheat and sheep holdings from 125 000 acres at Jerramungup; 40 farms at Mount Many Peaks in the Albany area and up to 100 farms were being developed with an area of 500 000 acres north of Bremer Bay. </para>
          <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline>spoke of the 250 000 acres of scrub land in South Australia being developed on Kangaroo Island to form more than 1 70 fat lamb properties. On the Murray River, at Loxton, Cool tong and Loveday, 328 blocks were being developed for the production of horticultural crops under irrigation. He also described work in Tasmania covering 13 000 acres of densely timbered land in swamp country in the area known at that time as Montagu but which has since been renamed To gar i. That land is being drained and developed. He referred also to work on King Island where 90 farms had been occupied, and further work on Flinders Island where 1 38 farms were being prepared from virgin scrub for fat lamb and beef cattle production. </para>
          <para>A moment ago I mentioned To gar i. The Minister for Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> will remember that I asked him a question about To gar i and the drainage there and I thank him for the answer I received today. I think it is important that we get into perspective the situation that the people find themselves in at To gar i at this time. Various authorities in Tasmania have made some funds available for partial snagging of the river there. Rather than help alleviate the problem that work has tended to increase it. One part of the Montagu River runs through a narrow rocky gorge. When the river rises quickly it cannot get past this narrow point and the water is forced back over the properties. This has brought about the problem that the people there have. It could well be that Tasmania may look at the matter and see whether it is possible, with the help of financial aid from the Commonwealth Government, to do something about widening the river, perhaps by blasting this rocky gorge, to increase the flow of water in that area. </para>

              <para>No, I do not think so. If the water were dammed it would be forced back all the time. It is just an unfortunate geographical feature. The water runs through a rocky cutting and this cutting causes an impediment in flood times. Flooding is the natural corollary. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>It was becoming apparent by 1 959 that further development of the scheme would fall off in future years. By that time over 8000 ex-servicemen had settled on the land, but there were still many outstanding applications from qualified people- men who had the requisite training or experience in agriculture. However, it was expected that projects in hand would enable those interested to be settled. It was appreciated that many men who had applied were settled in other vocations and were no longer genuinely interested in war service land settlement. Some of the settlers under the scheme had got into financial difficulties and it was appreciated that ways and means would have to be devised to see them over the difficult period which they were going through. It was apparent by the mid 1960s that there were real problems in some of the areas selected for development. In the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Adermann,</inline> then Minister for Primary Industry: </para>
            <para>It is recognised that problems have arisen, it is mainly extraordinary circumstances in many war service land settlement areas, such as those at King Island, Rocky Gully, Kangaroo Island and Loxton, and have required additional development work. This has delayed the completion of schemes that could have otherwise been completed perhaps by 1959 or 1960. These extraordinary circumstances have arisen, the Government is sympathetic and is prepared to meet the needs of settlers and see that they get a just recompense for their efforts. </para>
            <para class="block">There were many problems of location and of insufficient size of properties on King Island and elsewhere. Significant numbers of settlers simply gave up either because of a lack of experience or low morale due to isolation and the difficulties of making a profit. In the Loxton irrigation area in South Australia unexpected drainage problems were encountered which caused production of citrus fruits to be far less than anticipated. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Adermann</inline> said in 1967: </para>
            <para>There have been many testing problems. One I recall very well was that of Loxton when the expert technical advice given some years before that extensive drainage would not be necessary was proven wrong. </para>
            <para>We note from the second reading speech that a portion of the moneys made available under this Bill is for additional drainage works in Loxton. I cannot understand why there has been such a delay in this work being done. It has been delayed to this point. It is nice to see that at last something is being done about it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Adermann</inline> went on to say: </para>
            <para>We did not hesitate to undertake extensive and costly redevelopment to ensure that the farms were capable of the planned level of production. </para>
            <para class="block">On the other hand, there is still a lot of criticism of properties at places like King Island. One report indicated that no fewer than 116 settlers out of 1 54 had left the Island. </para>
            <para>It is also interesting to note in passing that a very large number of people who settled on King Island were not Tasmanians although King Island is a sovereign part of Tasmania. A very large number of people, many of whom I know quite well, came from Victoria and New South Wales because land was available on King Island for this sort of project which was not necessarily available in their own States. It is apparent that there were some major problems which had to be overcome over the long period in which the scheme had been functioning. Those problems have been highlighted in debates in both the House of Representatives and previously in the Senate. However, looked at from an overall point of view the scheme has served a very useful purpose in land development and the resettlement of a great number of ex-servicemen. It seems apparent that funds should continue to be made available for the purpose of overcoming problems and enabling those settlers who have now committed themselves irrevocably to their properties to continue in the business of farming. </para>
            <para>It is interesting to note at this point, when we look back over what has happened in some of the debates prior to this, that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Patterson</inline> moved an amendment in the other House on one occasion. He said: </para>
            <para>I now move the following amendment, which is in the same terms as the one I moved last year: </para>
            <para>That all words after &#39;That&#39; be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill, the House is of opinion that a Select Committee of the House should be appointed to inquire into all aspects of war service land settlement in Australia in order to formulate guidelines for any future land settlement scheme with particular reference to the level of rentals demanded from settlers, the method of valuations and the option of purchase price of properties. &#39; </para>
            <para class="block">If honourable members refer to pages 1604 and 1605 of the Hansard record dated 19 September 1972 they will find that the then Opposition opposed the motion that the Bill be read a third time. I wonder why. No explanation was given. 1 think it is pertinent that all people responsible for war service land settlement in some respect or other have to bear some of the responsibility for the fact that the scheme has never worked quite as well as was envisaged, notwithstanding the history of what happened after the First World War. I think this side of the Parliament is as responsible as the other side. But when we look back over what <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Patterson</inline> said in his amendment and subsequent to it we realise that this is perhaps one of the unfortunate instances in which politics has been played, not necessarily to the real benefit of the settlers concerned. </para>
            <para>The Authority has undoubtedly taken advantage of a general looseness in the principal Act. For instance section 2 (4) of this Act states that holdings shall be of sufficient size to enable settlers to operate efficiently and to earn a reasonable labour income. But who determines what is sufficient size and what is a reasonable labour income? It is the Authority. There is no provision in the Act for a farm size appeals board, so the Authority may divide an estate into 40-cow farms and then claim that the settlers have been allocated 70-cow farms. It is understood that the Authority had determined that $45 a week was sufficient labour income for settlers that it had under financial management. It may be true that these settlers accepted financial management but it is equally true that they accepted because they were under threat of eviction if they refused. </para>
            <para>At this point I mention that a subtle form of blackmail was used to induce settlers to accept offers of holdings. It is considered that the Authority waited until the settlers had invested their savings in their holdings, had made considerable improvements to the holdings and were in a position where, because of severe stock losses and heavy plant depreciation due to inadequate development in the first place, they would have faced bankruptcy had they refused to accept and they would have been evicted. The settlers were advised that if they failed to accept the offer within 21 days the Authority would consider offering the holding to another eligible person. I think it is correct to say that at a later date partial compensation was paid for stock losses and plant depreciation but this was not mentioned in the offer of holding. There is no known case of a settler who refused his offer of holding any such compensation. </para>
            <para>The prime cause of settler failure has been the lack of farm size but this could have been avoided if the Act had provided for the right of appeal to an independent statutory body which could hear not only appeals on farm size but also appeals on arrears caused by the lack of farm size. It is noted that the Authority has on scores of occasions put pressure on settlers who have had arrears of payments until those settlers walked off their holdings. After those settlers&#39; leases were terminated the Authority was quite happy to write off those arrears. The select committee of the Legislative Council of Tasmania which inquired into the administration of war service land settlement in Tasmania found that in that State as at 31 December 1970 the Commonwealth had written off $696,878 of settlers&#39; arrears. Supposedly the funds were appropriated for war service land settlement to establish eligible persons on the land. But now perhaps it could be said that these funds were misappropriated. They were and are being used virtually to nationalise land. </para>
            <para>Much capital has been made of a decision to give some settlers the right of appeal against the option purchase prices to a body known as the Option Purchase Prices Appeals Tribunal. On examination this Tribunal is found to be a non statutory body. It appears doubtful whether either the  chairman  of the Tribunal or the settlers concerned ever knew whether the Minister accepted the Tribunal&#39;s recommendations. So the appeal is still as before- from Caesar to Caesar. On 19 March 1974 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> asked the following question of the Attorney-General; at that time it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> who is now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy: </para>
            <para>Would a tribunal be considered to be truly independent if one of its members had been involved in the determination of the matter under dispute? </para>
            <para class="block">The reply was: </para>
            <para>The question calls for an expression of opinion. I must say, however, that it is a well-established rule of law that the principles of natural justice require that a person adjudicating in a dispute between parties should not himself have an interest in the subject matter of the dispute, or to have otherwise been involved personally in the matter under dispute. </para>
            <para class="block">When the Minister for Agriculture replies I would like him to comment on the reasons for the appointment to the Tribunal of the First Assistant Secretary (Grants Administration), Australian Department of Agriculture which incorporates the War Service Land Settlement Division. Also I would like the reason for the appointment of this same person or any other person connected with the administration of war service land settlement to the appeal board established under section 68 of the Tasmanian War Service Land Settlement Act. Will the Minister also advise what steps he intends to take to correct this anomaly? Will the Minister also indicate whether he will introduce amending legislation to provide a right of appeal against farm size to a statutory body? I think it is extremely important that this matter should be looked at. </para>
            <para>I know that the schemes have been in operation for many years and that a lot of people have been established on properties for a long time. But we must recognise that a very large number of those people are now well into their fifties- some are in their early sixties- and they are no longer able to cope with all the physical effort involved in farming and also with the worry that is caused by an ever-decreasing income and an ever-increasing cost factor. Unfortunately due to the way in which the Act is written these people are not able to have access to farm reconstruction plans and other assistance which is made available through various Commonwealth agencies. Because of the bad record of some settlers, not necessarily due entirely to their own efforts, it is not always possible for these people to get assistance under the War Service Land Settlement Acts, the result being that very many of them are finding it extremely difficult to continue. </para>
            <para>Very recently the costs involved in farming have gone up by 35 per cent and unfortunately incomes have fallen by up to 40 per cent in some cases. We all know of the occasions- I think they are legion- when mention has been made in both Houses of Parliament of the increased costs involved in farming, such as the increased cost of fertilisers due to the removal of the bounty and the increased price of superphosphate rock, the increased cost of transport and the increased telephone charges. All these matters affect the war service land settler just as they affect everyone else. In fact they affect him worse because, unless he has been able to establish resources over a period of time whereby he can buy or obtain access to extra land, he is not like the ordinary farmer and he does not have the ability to be able to overcome the tremendous difficulties in which such people find themselves at present. </para>
            <para>It is to be hoped, now that this matter is before the Senate, that the Minister will look at this problem that has been with us, particularly in Tasmania, for many years. I am sure the Minister is aware of it. I do not think the Labor Party in Government is altogether to blame. I think some blame must fall on the previous Government. But that does not alter the fact that now is the time when decisions must be made and responsibility must be accepted by the Minister and by the Government. It is to be hoped that these people will be assisted in such a way that their main worry- the inability to maintain the income from their properties to meet commitments to the Government- will be alleviated in the not too distant future. It is to be hoped that assistance will go to these people, who, firstly, have served their country and, secondly, have worked extremely hard to earn a living and to maintain their families on these properties, so that they will be able to spend the twilight of their lives in some sort of security- at least security of mind. </para>
            <para>It is known that many settlers in the Bass Strait islands and on the Tasmanian mainland have had pressure put on them to terminate their tenancies. Will the Minister advise whether he is quite happy for settlers in his own State to be put on the road simply because the Authority miscalculated, because the Act does not provide an appeal against farm size and because no provision is made for additional land to be made available to these people. I realise that there is a physical difficulty in making additional land available, particularly in a settlement area in which the farms are set out side by side. In instances where settlers have had to leave their properties by reason of their being no longer physically or financially able to continue, I think it may well be possible for governments- I say governments&#39; advisedly- to cut their losses, to divide up properties, particularly where there is one on either side of an empty block, and to make available some additional land for other settlers. We must not forget that when the scheme was established in the early 1950s a 45-cow property was probably able to produce a reasonable standard of living. The same could not be said today for a property twice its size. I do not think anybody can be blamed for that but we must recognise that there is a problem and, if possible, try to establish these people in a position where they can reasonably expect to make a living and meet their commitments. </para>
            <para>Section 5 (2) of the relevant Act does not bear very close examination. It reads: </para>
            <para>When the planned works involved in any holding forming part of the project have been substantially completed, a valuation of the holding shall be made in consultation by officers appointed by the Commonwealth and the State for that purpose. </para>
            <para>The only right a settler has is to reject the offer of a holding. At this point a settler&#39;s success or failure is determined and it has been at this point that the scheme in general has failed. Any miscalculation here can mean only settler failure. It is fair to say that if there had not been any miscalculation at this point there would be few, if any, cases of settler failure. It is also fair to say that if settler failure is due to miscalculation by these officers then the funds appropriated for war service land settlement have not been used in the manner intended by the Parliament when the appropriations were approved. Had the holdings been at the standard indicated in the rental and option to purchase price valuations there is little doubt that this scheme would have worked in the way the Parliament intended. Unfortunately, when Parliament makes a judgment, as it will in a few moments; it cannot possibly foresee, particularly in a country like Australia where so much of our produce is sold on the international market, what the market position or what the cost position will be in 10 years from today, as has been the case in the past with regard to land settlement. </para>
            <para>The Opposition supports this Bill. We realise that if this scheme is to be kept in any way viable it is occasionally necessary for money to be appropriated for the purpose of making loans to settlers, either as carry-on loans or as loans to replace machinery or even stock. The Opposition hopes that the Minister for Agriculture will keep in mind some of the points I have made. They refer to problems that settlers have faced for as long as we have had soldier settlement. </para>

            <para>in reply- This question of war service land settlement is one which has had as long a history of debate in this Parliament as has any scheme commenced by any government. As I have said in the past, when I was appointed to this portfolio 2V4 years ago and was required to acquaint myself with the background to this scheme, I could come to only one conclusion. It was that our predecessors, the Liberal-Country Party Government, over the years had been generous to war service land settlers. Basically the policies which were pursued by the previous Government have been continued by this Government. There were many decisions taken by my predecessor which I believe could be described only as fair and generous. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Over the years a great deal of money has been made available from Federal sources to finance soldier settlers on very favourable conditions with favourable interest rates and favourable terms of repayment. The truth of the matter is that the great majority of war service land settlers have been successful and have not in the main suffered any great problems, apart from the normal downturns and the problems which affect the whole of the farming community anyway. There have been cases where war service land settlers have not been successful. Many have not been successful because of their own fault. It is as simple as that. They have not applied themselves as have their comrades who also went on to the land under exactly the same conditions. It could not be said that any government since the war has been anything but very sympathetic to the whole of the war service land settlement movement. I know that there have been agitators perhaps that is not the word to use, but I would call them pressure groups within the associations who have - </para>

              <para>There have been malcontents who have not been so successful as other settlers, and for some reason this is said to be the responsibility of the governments over the years. I reject that. I reject it in respect of Liberal governments as I do in respect of Labor governments. It is true that in isolated areas there have been problems such as those that have been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bessell.</inline> These were matters about which neither the State governments nor the Federal Government could have done much. All in all, I emphasise that the whole program over the years, despite some shortcomings, has been basically a very generous one. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>My predecessor studied the Fenton report on Tasmania, as I did. I came to the same conclusions as he did, with one exception, that is, I agreed to the appointment of a tribunal to hear appeals on option prices. I dare say that was another step forward, but in the main I believe that the actions that were taken before the present Government came to office were fair and reasonable in the circumstances. </para>
            <para>It is a fact that the majority of settlers are solvent. There are some who do have arrears problems, but most of them have met their commitments under the scheme to the respective governments. I think it should be borne in mind that so much of what is done is done through the State instrumentalities. I do not think it is valid to be critical of the officers who have to inspect properties. They are commissioned to make a judgment as to whether they believe a settler is in fact doing an efficient job or a reasonably efficient job on his property. There is no ban on the purchase of adjoining land in order to expand the property that a settler has. Once again I can only say that from my experience every co-operation has been afforded to those settlers who have found themselves in difficulties. I would not suggest for a moment that certain improvements could not be effected. I certainly do not deny that some settlers are in trouble, but I reject the argument that this has been caused by the ungenerous attitude of governments over the years towards settlers. It is necessary that this legislation be carried as part of the continuing scheme. </para>

Let me conclude by indicating the Government&#39;s pleasure that we are at least getting this legislation through today with the support of the Opposition. We all know that many promises have been made in the past about these matters, but generally my overall impression is that the war service land settlement scheme has done a tremendous amount over the years on very favourable terms and conditions for those who availed themselves of it. </para>

            <para>The Trade Practices Bill 1975 is a Bill to amend the substantial piece of legislation that was adopted by the Parliament last year- the Trade Practices Act. The Bill contains 3 separate amendments to the existing legislation. The Opposition supports that legislation and, in their present form, it finds these amendments to be quite satisfactory and necessary in the operation of the legislation. The Act has now been in operation in its entirety for some three or four months. The particular problems dealt with by these amendments have arisen since then. I will outline briefly the amendments and their effect. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The first of the amendments contained in this short Bill is to be found in clause 3 of the Bill. It has resulted from some doubt that has arisen as to the effect of Part IV- in particular section 51- of the Trade Practices Act. That section deals with the various exceptions in the Part. It provides for the exceptions to the contraventions contained in the Act. It sets out a number of exceptions and allowances of contracts based in  s( &#39;Tie  cases on the fact that they are approved or authorised under existing Acts of this Parliament or of the States or ordinances of a Territory. In that and various other ways it excepts certain conduct from contravention of the Act. The doubt that has arisen is as to whether those exceptions apply to section 45 of the Act. That is the section which makes contracts in restraint of trade or commerce unenforceable and which forbids such contracts. Some doubt has arisen as te whether one can still find a contract unenforceable under section 45 of the Act when it is allow able under section 51. As the Government has said, it has always been the intention that the legislation should be so applied. All that the amendment in this respect does is to make it perfectly clear that section 5 1 of the Act does apply to section 45 ( 1 ). That being the intention, the proposition has the support of the Opposition. </para>
        <para>The second of the three sets of amendments is to be found in clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill. They relate to the two different provisions of the principal Act which provide that regulations may be made to provide for, in the first case, product safety standards and, in the second case, product information standards. I will refer to them together because exactly the same amendment covers both section 62 and 63 of the principal Act. The position which has arisen is that regulations may apply to goods which are intended for sale overseas where requirements set here may not apply. One may take the example of a provision which might be in our legislation, perhaps relating to safety belts, but which is not the law in the country to which the car or other goods are being exported. As I understand it, the position which the Government and the Opposition take, is that manufacturers of goods which are intended for export should not be required to carry out various arrangements or provide certain facilities which are not required and perhaps not useable or desired in the country to which the goods are to go. That being the intention, the provision which is made in this Bill is that regulations may exclude- not that they necessarily will exclude- nom their operation goods of a kind set out in the regulations that are intended to be used outside Australia. </para>
        <para>The Opposition in the House of Representatives proposed a further amendment, which was accepted by the Government, which required that a statement indicating that the goods were intended to be used outside Australia should be affixed to the goods. The purpose of this amendment was to bring to the attention of the users of the goods, if the goods were finally used in Australia, that the requirements had not been met because the goods were intended originally for export. As I said, the amendment was accepted by the Government and it is now in the Bill as it stands. As I understand the situation, the 2 clauses relating to goods intended for export will not have the effect of allowing inferior quality goods. But in view of the fact that overseas competition is difficult enough and that our goods should not be at a competitive disadvantage as against goods of other countries, it was essential that these amendments be made to the Bill. </para>
        <para>The third proposal contained in the Bill concerns a problem that is probably better known, namely, the unsolicited forwarding of credit cards to people in Australia. This was a matter that caused a certain amount of furore for a period last year when bank cards were sent to hundreds and thousands of people. In some cases this action caused some anxiety and some annoyance. There seems to be some doubt as to whether very much harm came from this action. Apparently very few objections were made, according to the New South Wales Ministry of Consumer Affairs. On the other hand, it has been said that up to 80 or 100 cases of fraud lent misuse of those bank cards have taken place. Whatever may be the situation, there is no doubt that to many people the delivery of unsolicited bank cards caused a considerable annoyance. In addition, I understand that another scheme, the gold key credit card scheme in Queensland, involved the delivery of cards and that somewhat the same objections were raised. People who receive these credit cards were upset and annoyed. They did not know what to do with them. In some cases they felt that the cards might fall into the wrong hands. In addition there was complaint that the cards constituted a breach of privacy so far as the persons who received them were concerned. One might even feel that a certain amount of domestic disharmony may have been caused by the sudden arrival of credit cards, particularly where the amount of credit allocated to the wife was greater than that of the husband. </para>

            <para>I hope not, senator. I am not prepared to disclose that because to do so would be a breach of privacy. But I would think that generally the arrival of such cards caused considerable upset to some people. There is a provision in the existing Act which relates to unsolicited goods but it is clear that this section does not cover the situation beyond any doubt so far as the sending of these cards is concerned. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Bill provides that in future a corporation shall not send a credit card to a person except, firstly, in pursuance of a request in writing by that person or, secondly, in the case of the renewal or replacement of or substitution for such a credit card or one that had been used for that purpose. In future corporations must obtain prior permission before such cards can be sent out. Failure to comply with this provision can attract a substantial penalty under section 79 of the principal Act. It seems to the Opposition that that likewise is a desirable course to be taken. I understand that the banks have agreed to the form of this legislation and recognise the necessity for it. The Opposition supports this amendment also. </para>
          <para>No doubt other amendments to this very important legislation will be required from time to time, and these three are perhaps but minor ones in the scheme of things. There does appear to be some obscurity in the language of the Act which people are noting on close perusal. There seems to be some confusion in relation to consumer legislation and the extent to which there is overlapping between the Commonwealth and the State legislation. No doubt other more major amendments will be required from time to time, but these 3 amendments appear to be clearly desirable, and the Opposition gives its support. </para>

          <para>in reply- The Government is grateful to the Opposition for the helpful attitude it has taken to the Trade Practices Bill, both here and in the other place. As a matter of fact, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> has mentioned, one of the amendments to this Bill was suggested by the Opposition when the Bill was being debated in the other place. I think it is generally conceded that this important piece of legislation, being a novel enactment which I think everyone has agreed is a great improvement on the body of law in this country, is naturally a measure which lends itself to amendment from time to time. Because of its novelty, we are proceeding in some spheres by trial and error and it is inevitable, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> said, that there will be further amendments in the future as practice shows gaps or even flaws in the legislation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think that the amendments and the attitude which the Opposition has taken to these amendments are in the general spirit in which this legislation was born. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> as he then was, who pioneered this legislation was always open to suggestion for improvements. I can remember myself being lobbied by a group of businessmen who had seen a draft of the original Bill, who gave a lot of care and thought to the draft and who came along with a body of suggested amendments which in due course I took along to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> and he and his advisers considered them seriously. Many of those amendments were ultimately embodied in the Bill which was presented to the Parliament. It is in that spirit that the Government sees the need for a constant scrutiny of the way in which this Act is working. It is for that reason that this Bill was introduced. As there is no contest in the matter, I am content to thank the Opposition for its co-operation. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>The Opposition does not oppose this Bill and what I have to say will not take very long. It is a Bill which provides that procedures for reference and appeal to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission should apply with respect to disputes which arise under the Flight Crew Officers Tribunal. The Flight Crew Officers Tribunal was established in 1967. It is the body which deals with disputes existing or arising concerning pilots, navigators and flight engineers. These people come under the jurisdiction of the Flight Crew Officers Tribunal and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has no concern with them at the present time. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that there is a means by which through appeal and reference these matters can be taken to the Commission. In short form, therefore, the Bill is essentially concerned with bringing these employees into the same position, broadly speaking, as other employees within the Commission&#39;s jurisdiction. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government obviously believes that this step which it has taken is desirable and should be taken. I think the Government ought to heed the past experience of the dispute settling procedures relating to flight crew and allied personnel. There was a time in the 1950s when these employees were subject to the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. My recollection is that the Air Pilots Association was a registered organisation under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Air Pilots Association was either deregistered or voluntarily withdrew from the surveillance of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and for many years operated outside that Act. It was an achievement of some significance, I think in 1967, that enabled the Government, after consultation with the relevant persons, to establish the Flight Crew Officers Tribunal. That has been the body to which disputes which have occurred in the intervening years have been referred and it is by that Tribunal that the necessary arbitrated decisions have been able to be made. I understand that what has now happened is that the Government without consultation such a striking departure from those canons and conduct which when in Opposition it suggested the Liberal and National Country Parties should follow- has now decided to bring the flight crew officers under the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. We trust that this will operate to the benefit of the community and to those who are affected by any decisions which have to be made. </para>
          <para>But the decision does enable one to point to some of the very subtle double standards which this Government engages in. I know that we have had before us in this Senate on a number of occasions a Bill which has not received the support of the Opposition. It is a Bill which seeks to establish a new concept of the public interest in the certification of agreements which are made by negotiation. The Government, of course, in 1972 made great play in its pre-election propaganda of the need to emphasise negotiation and conciliation and to play down any emphasis of arbitration. We heard much talk of meaningful negotiations and of the desirability of negotiated agreements being accepted. Of course the unreasonableness of this approach has been seen frequently in recent times when, as a result of negotiated agreements, immense salary claims have been made and conceded by the employers without regard to the consequences to the public, in particular to the flow-on consequences and to the relativities by which other workers are guided and the consequent desire on their part to maintain the traditional relativities which have applied. This has been a not insignificant feature in the bout of wage claims and excessive wage increases which has now received the condemnation of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and I think of both the former and present Ministers for Labor and Immigration. This is one of the consequences of this plea for negotiated agreements to be recognised and to be accepted. </para>
          <para>A provision in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides that such negotiated agreements are to be certified and made awards only if it is in the public interests that they are so treated as awards. The Government has not welcomed that provision and has sought to have it amended. That has been the subject matter of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill which has come before this chamber from time to time and has not been passed by it. The reason it has not been passed is that the concept which the Bill has sought to introduce is a concept that the agreement shall be regarded as automatically applying unless someone can establish that there is grave detriment to the public interest. The imposition of that onus is an imposition which the Opposition has felt to be unreasonable. We believe that the whole purpose of establishing the conciliation and arbitration machinery contained in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is to emphasise that conciliation is necessary in the public interest. If, in the public interest, conciliation does not achieve results there should be arbitration. </para>
          <para>Going back to the original Conciliation an Arbitration Act which was established by Deakin it is apparent that the public interest was always the rationale and the motivation for legislation of this character. It has continued to be the motivation, and surely in this day and age it can be only the public interest which justifies conciliation and arbitration legislation. If we do not have that public interest concept warring factions of unions and employers can lead to endless dis put at on between themselves to the detriment of the public. It ought to be remembered that conciliation and arbitration legislation is legislation calculated to protect the community from the dislocation which such conflict, unregulated, can bring. </para>
          <para>I have said that because this Bill flies right in the face of all that the Government has been attempting to do in its earlier legislation. In its earlier legislation it sought to remove from the Bill the requirement that things should be certified, should be referred or should be approved in the public interest. It seeks to put in place of that requirement this concept, which is left for someone undefined to raise, that things shall not be certified if a grave detriment to the public interest can be shown. But this Bill, of course, requires that the Commission shall do certain things; it shall entertain references and it shall entertain appeals if in the public interest it is desirable to do so. I invite the new Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> to make a noteworthy striking contribution in, I think, the first debate in which he will engage in his new capacity and explain why it is that in the erstwhile Bill the concept of the public interest is removed and in this Bill the concept of the public interest is sought to be established as the criterion. </para>
          <para>The second matter to which I refer in passing is another double standard in which the Government is engaged. It relates to whether or not the processes of conciliation by ministerial direction should be departed from in favour of arbitration. I seem to recall that it was not so long ago that it was accepted- certainly there are still some members of the Australian Labor Party who seek to develop this idea- that arbitration ought to be resorted to, if at all, only as a very last resort and that conciliation is the procedure which should be adopted. Consistently also it has been recognised that independent statutory bodies should not be interfered with by Government in order to achieve particular results- particularly results as to what should be the level of salaries and wages which are to be paid by particular employers. But we have become accustomed in recent times to the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> frequently complaining about the excessive wage claims and the excessive demands of various personnel within the jurisdiction of the Flight Crew Officers Tribunal. Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jones</inline> can only beat the air with regard to the Employees of Ansett Transport Industries he feels that he can take a different stand with regard to the employees under the control of the Australian National Airlines Commission- that is, Trans-Australiann Airlines. </para>
          <para>I recall putting a question on notice some time ago after one of these outbursts by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jones</inline> to ascertain whether the Minister did take action under the Australian National Airlines Act to direct the Commission as to the course it should follow. After some time I received a reply. I refer any honourable senator who is interested to the full question and answer which appears in the Senate Hansard of 4 March of this year. One question I asked was: </para>
          <para>Does the Commission accept instructions from the Minister for Transport with respect to the salaries to be paid to its employees? </para>
          <para class="block">The answer I received- it contains a lot of words -was as follows: </para>
          <para class="block">The conditions applicable to the appointment of officers of the Commission are prescribed in section 17 of the Act. Subject to the provisions of awards and agreements, the Commission has power to determine the terms and conditions of employment of its staff. The rate of salary payable to the General Manager is determined by the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1973. The rates payable to other officers are determined by the Com mss ion subject to the approval of the Minister for Transport where the rate of salary exceeds $13,700 per annum. </para>
          <para class="block">I simply say that that is a fairly clear indication that in the higher levels of salary the Minister has a power which he may exercise. The next question I asked was: </para>
          <para>Has the Commission accepted instructions from the Minister in respect of the recent claim by air pilots for a salary increase; if so, what were these instructions? </para>
          <para class="block">The significant reply was as follows: </para>
          <para>The Commission was advised by me - </para>
          <para class="block">That is by the.Minister for Transport that  the claims for salary increases by the Federation of Air Pilots should be determined by arbitration before the Flight Crew Officers Tribunal. Following this arbitration which resulted in a lower rate of increase than that agreed by Ansett Transport Industries and the Federation of Air Pilots, the Commission was informed that it should exercise its own managerial judgment and decide what changes in salaries and conditions it should agree with the Federation of Air Pilots. </para>
          <para class="block">There is a striking example of this Government arguing and directing that arbitration should take place in preference to conciliation, and, when arbitration resulted in the absurd situation that a lesser amount was arrived at by arbitration than had been agreed to by the Federation of Air Pilots and the other airline company, the Minister then says: &#39;Well, let there be an agreement reached&#39;. It shows the absurdity of the Government&#39;s action, as well as its double standards. </para>

              <para>It is quite possible, if the honourable senator wants to find that sort of extenuation, to justify what I think is otherwise an absolutely inexplicable piece of work on the part of the Minister. But I raise these matters, firstly, because this is an opportunity when they can be raised, and, secondly, because they highlight the inconsistencies for which this Government is becoming renowned. The Opposition offers no objection to the basic principle which is inherent in the legislation now before the Senate. It trusts the legislation will work in the public interest but it acknowledges that the way the Government has gone about such matters in its recent history in dealing with airline matters does not leave very much hope that it has learned by experience. </para>

            <para>Despite the invitation from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> I do not propose to embark on a long dissertation on the relationship of the public interest to arbitration legislation but I cannot forbear from saying a little in reply to the allegation that this is a government with double standards. We have heard- at least as long as I have been in this place I have heard- a constantly reiterated theme that this Government is soft on the unions; that it will not stand up to the unions; and that it has no wages policy. But in the last few days I think we have had a curious example of the double standards of the Opposition. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If honourable senators opposite are really indignant about unilateral action by groups in the community to raise their living standards at the expense of the rest of the community and if they are outraged by defiance of decisions of arbitrators, one would have expected from them yesterday and today a long, moralistic dissertation on the recent conduct of the doctors throughout Australia. They have continued to rant against the metal workers and to point to the immorality of the people in that level of the wage structure thinking they are entitled to a bit more. But I have listened in vain for the slightest strictures on the already fairly well rewarded section of the community that belongs to the Australian Medical Association, which has thumbed its nose at an arbitrator appointed by themselves and which just baldly has told the community that it will insist on having everything to which it thinks it is entitled. I think this is as blatant an example of double standards as we have had in the matter of an appropriate rate of remuneration for various sections of the community. </para>
          <para>Everything that the honourable senator who has just sat down said was irrelevant to the purpose of this Bill. This Bill merely aims to bring airline pilots into the same position as other sections of the community in respect of appeals from decisions of the tribunal which hears its applications in the first instance. I understand that this is a purpose which is concurred in by the Opposition. But I should like to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> also before I sit down of another apposite little piece of history in relation to this particular section of the community. I think it is particularly fitting to remind the honourable senator of this because of the situation the country finds itself in at the present time. I refer to the position that arose at the time of the last airline strike, about which the honourable senator expressed a few indignant remarks in respect of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Charles</inline> Jones. </para>
          <para>What happened in the last airline strike was that the Government airline, Trans-Australiann Airlines, was prepared to resist what undoubtedly were insupportable demands by the pilots but that the ground was cut from beneath its feet by the private airline operator, Ansett Airlines of Australia, which caved in and gave the pilots what they wanted, leaving TAA no alternative but to follow suit. That was an example of the private employer sabotaging the arbitration system. </para>
          <para>I would like to put on record a fear which I have in relation to the present actions which the Government is taking to ensure that a rational wages policy is followed by the work force in the present crisis of inflation. I hope my fear does not come true. I fear very much that the efforts which the Government is making to hold the line to reasonable wage increases at present will be sabotaged by individual employers. I fear that as an economic upturn arrives it will not be the unions which will sabotage the indexation decisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission but that individual greedy employers will succumb to pressure and we will find the ground cut from beneath the feet of arbitration again, in the same way as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett cut the ground from beneath the feet of the Flight Crew Officers Industrial Tribunal at the time of the pilots&#39; strike. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> talked about double standards, about the public interest and about an all-out effort to do something about inflation. I would remind him that he could well use his eloquence and his indignation in directions other than against the trade unions. He could suggest to some of the employers whom he knows that they should continue to respect arbitration. Next time he is unfortunate enough to have to go to his doctor I trust he will be as indignant to the doctor as he customarily is in this place to the metal workers. </para>

              <para>These Bills are of a machinery nature and can be dealt with expeditiously. The Opposition will not be opposing them. Both Bills relate to conversion from the imperial system of measurement to the metric system of measurement. Since 1970 there has been a progressive transition from the imperial system to the metric system of measurement of quantities. The dried vine fruit industry converted to metric measurement at the beginning of the current season on 1 March this year. The Australian Dried Fruits Control Board has recommended that legislative approval be given to the conversion. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>The purpose of the Dried Fruits Export Charges Bill is to obtain parliamentary approval for conversion to metric measurement of the maximum permissible rate of charge on exports of dried fruits as provided in the Dried Fruits Export Charges Act 1 924-1 970. There are 2 variations provided for in this Bill. The first provides for the metric unit, the kilogram, which is 2.2406 lb to be substituted for the imperial unit the pound. The second variation is that the maximum rate of charge which may be applied is varied from three-tenths of a cent per lb to seven tenths of a cent per kilogram. This is the nearest rational metric equivalent to the previous rate but results in an increase of 5.8 per cent in the maximum rate of charge. The Minister for Agriculture indicated in his second reading speech that the present rate of charge is 50 per cent only of the permissible maximum rate as prescribed in a regulation made under the Act. The moneys provided by the charge constitute the biggest part of the finances of the Australian Dried Fruits Control Board which is responsible for controlling the export, the sale and the distribution after export of Australian dried currants, sultanas and raisins. </para>
            <para>The second Bill, the Dried Fruits Levy Bill, provides for 2 amendments. The first is that the metric unit, the tonne, is substituted for the imperial unit, the ton. The tonne, as honourable senators will know, is 2204 lb and the ton is 2240 lb. The maximum rate of levy which may be applied is varied from $ 1 per ton to $ 1 per tonne in the case of dried vine fruits, and from $5 per ton to $5 per tonne in respect to dried tree fruit. The effect of these variations, because of the difference in the number of pounds as between a tonne and a ton is an increase of 1.6 per cent in the maximum rates of levy. But again, as in the Dried Fruits Export Charges Bill, the rate is about 50 per cent of the maximum prescribed under regulation. The funds raised by the levy are applied to the financing of the Dried Fruits Research Committee which sponsors scientific, technical and economic research in connection with the production, processing and packaging of dried fruits- all worthy requirements. </para>
            <para>As I have said, the Opposition does not oppose these measures; but I wish to take the opportunity of making reference to a matter which has close relevance to the dried fruits industry, particularly in South Australia, and which I think is related directly to the Dried Fruits Export Charges Bill because it provides for charges to that industry . I refer to the high level of salinity in the River Murray waters from time to time in South Australia, which is in fact becoming quite persistent and which is reaching levels disturbing to the fruit industries of South Australia dependent upon River Murray water for irrigation. I make the plea to the Minister and to the Government that a very close watch be kept in conjunction with the River Murray Commission and other authorities that this very pernicious increase in salinity be investigated and such action be taken from time to time as will alleviate this very serious problem. </para>
            <para>We at the end of the line in the River Murray in South Australia suffer the effects of huge irrigation settlements above us. As the water is pushed out from the river to the surrounding lands and percolates back through saline strata we find this build-up of salty water coming down to the far end where we are, causing these aggravated problems both within our own areas of drainage back into the water of the Murray as with the pollution occurring higher up. I refer to this matter because it is in direct relationship to the well being of the industry which is being converted to metric measurement. The well being of this industry is so closely aligned to the availability of reasonably sweet water that I make this plea this afternoon as we discuss these Bills. The Opposition does not oppose the measures that are now before us. </para>

            <para>I am pleased, of course, that the Opposition is not opposing the legislation as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> has indicated. The matters covered by the Bill are mainly machinery matters necessitated by the conversion to the metric system. In respect of the more substantive matter that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> raised, I must confess that I am not conversant with the details. The matter does not come specifically within the area of my portfolio and I was not anticipating that it would be raised. I am aware, of course, of the quite long history of disputation over this question, involving I think both the Victorian and South Australian governments. I will undertake to raise the matter with the Minister responsible although I have some doubts as to his capacity to take any specific action as a Federal Minister. However, as I have said, I will raise the matter with him. </para>

            <para>This Bill provides for Australian Government expenditure of up to $200,000 as part of the money required for flood mitigation work at Seymour in Victoria. The total cost of the work is about $500,000, of which the Australian Government is contributing about 40 per cent. This work is being undertaken as a result of the floods which occurred in both 1973 and 1974 at Seymour, on both occasions due to flooding of Whiteheads Creek at Seymour which had not previously been a cause of trouble. The work to be carried out is detailed in the Bill. The Government is making a contribution to meet the cost of that work. One may express some disappointment, I think, that the Government was not a little more generous because when the floods occurred originally there was an immediate response by both the Federal and State Governments, the flooding having caused some loss of life and considerable damage to Seymour and buildings in the area. On that occasion, as reported in the &#39;Age&#39; of 17 May 1974, the following announcement was made: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Federal Government has offered dollar-for-dollar financial aid to the Victorian Government for helping flood victims. </para>
          <para>It has also offered to meet the full cost of approved rehabilitation and restoration initiatives above the first $3.5m. </para>
          <para class="block">Unfortunately the amount set out in this Bill is only 40 per cent of the total cost of the work to be carried out and the State Government has agreed to pay the difference, so there will not be any responsibility left to the citizens of Seymour who of course have suffered already as a result of these floods. The work has practically been completed, as I understand it, and in fact this proposed expenditure is necessary to complete the work which of necessity had to be done. The Opposition supports the Bill and wishes it a speedy passage. </para>

            <para>in reply- I thank the Opposition for supporting the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> said that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> had announced Australian Government assistance on a dollar for dollar basis for flood victims. The assistance being given under this Bill is not for flood victims; it is assistance to rectify a dangerous flood situation caused by, I think, the railway line at Seymour. It is not a matter of assisting flood victims. Assistance is given on the same pro rata basis in respect of other flood mitigation work. Agreement has been reached between the Australian Government and the Victorian Government. This legislation appropriates the money that is required. I thank the Opposition for a speedy passage of this legislation. </para>

Having recently acquired a copy of the second reading speech to this Bill I find that it deals with a matter of very great moment but of little apprehension for the Opposition.

            </talker>
              <para>I am tempted to accede to the wishes of the Government senators but I think we might have different stances on different Bills. I do not think we can follow that course. I speak on the 5 Bills which provide for the proposed redistributions. I put to the Senate that the Government&#39;s action in presenting these Bills to the Senate exposes the Government in its true colours. By its own actions the Government has admitted that it is not interested in genuine electoral reform; it is interested, however, in creating a gerrymander. It is determined by whatever means possible to do everything it can to perpetuate itself in office, even while it is tearing itself apart internally. If that requires rigging the boundaries, if that requires overlooking the laws of the land, then this Government will do so. Integrity and honesty have flown out the window. Principles have been replaced with opportunism. This Government will take any steps it considers necessary to achieve its objectives and its chief objective is to stay in power by so rigging the system that it cannot be removed. It is not concerned with being a good Government. It is not concerned with winning the support of the people through achievements, but it is concerned with manipulating the rules of the game to its own advantage. It wants to play with a stacked deck. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>The boundaries which these Bills seek to impose upon the electorate have already been rejected once by the Senate. They were rejected because they were unfair. The arguments have already been canvassed and I will not take up the Senate&#39;s time by going through them again in detail. I shall say only this: The proposed new boundaries would protect the Government from any reasonable swing against it. Worse, if the 1974 results were repeated, the Government would end up with a majority in the House of Representatives of eleven instead of the present majority of five. In fact that would be less when we win Bass in Tasmania on 28 June. So by stacking the deck the Government would end up with an increase of six in its floor majority. Therefore I can understand why the Government wants these proposed boundaries. They are not bad boundaries at all for the Government. But I say quite flatly that it is a fiddle. No matter what the Government may say this fact remains. The Government has embraced these boundaries because they are the best it can get. They provide the Government with an unfair advantage. </para>
            <para>If the Government gets away with this attempt to fiddle with the electoral laws it will become impossible to remove the Government no matter how much damage it does to the economy, no matter how many people it throws out of work, no matter how many people suffer from its inflationary policies. I put it to the Senate that if the Government were honest, if it were fair, if it were not opportunist, it could have easily overcome the Senate&#39;s distrust of the boundaries embodied in this legislation. The electoral law itself spells out the methods by which a government can deal with a distribution which is rejected by one House or the other. Perhaps we are being a little too optimistic in expecting the Government to honour the electoral laws. </para>
            <para>This Government talks a lot about convention. What it means is that the conventions it wants should be observed. But the conventions that in any way attempt to check its abuse of power are always overlooked. The Government wants one law for the people and another for itself. As I have said, the electoral law itself provides simple and proper machinery to deal with this problem. </para>
            <para class="block">Section 24 of the Act provides quite simply for the Government to refer the distributions back to the Commissioners if either House rejects them. The Commissioners can then redraw the boundaries and come up with another proposal, which the Parliament may once again consider. That course is proper and correct. It was included in the legislation to overcome the present situation. </para>
            <para>Yet the Government, once again, has chosen to by-pass the law. I ask: Why is it by-passing the law? I answer by saying: Because it fears what might happen. I put to the Senate that the cynicism of the Government has now been exposed. While the Government talks about these boundaries being fair, the real position is that the Government knows these boundaries are unfair. They would help the Government resist the will of the people. They would allow it to take even more unpopular measures and remain in office despite the desire of the majority of voters to throw them out. That is the real reason why the Government promotes these Bills. Once again this Government is trying to disguise its deceit. </para>
            <para>Once again it tries to rush through the Parliament legislation which it hopes will escape scrutiny. In the other place the Government allowed only 4 hours debate on the Bills, claiming urgency. I ask: What urgency, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President?</inline> There is no election for the House of Representatives due until May 1977, which is almost 2 years away. What the Government is trying to do is sneak these Bills through the Parliament now and hope the electorate will forget about this fraud by the time the day of reckoning arrives. I note that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> in speaking on these Bills in another place, tried to bluff the Opposition into letting them pass. He said: </para>
            <para>In the event of continued Senate obstruction to any of the 5 Bills, we shall allow the people of Australia yet another opportunity to endorse, as they did last May, the principle of equality of representation in the Australian Parliament. </para>
            <para>If the Senate again rejects this principle, that rejection will again be an issue on which the people will be able to pass judgment. </para>
            <para class="block">I say only this about the argument the Prime Minister tried to put up: If he talks about equality of voting, he talks rubbish. The Constitution itself ignores equality of voting. The Prime Minister himself ignores this principle. Only last year the people rejected his attempt to insert in the Constitution a clause which would have required electorates to be based on total numbers, not on numbers of voters. I ask: What sort of equality is that? It totally ignores the Prime Minister&#39;s own avowed dedication to the principle of one-vote one-value. What he tried to insert in the Constitution means one vote with varying values. It would have been another way of manipulating the electorate in favour of the Labor Party. The people saw through that ploy and rejected it. </para>
            <para>The plain fact is that there cannot be total equality of voting. The redistribution proposals now contained in these Bills do not even pretend to be equal. The quota in Queensland is 64 842; in Victoria it is 63 507; in New South Wales it is 62 765; in Western Australia it is 62 071; but in Tasmania the quota is 49 198, in the Australian Capital Territory it is about 53 500, and in the Northern Territory it is about 39 386. So much for this principle which the Prime Minister claims to endorse, but conveniently overlooks. I say without reservation that once again he is talking hogwash. </para>
            <para>Apart from paying ex-service to these grand principles, the Prime Minister has also issued a threat. He tried to say that he would make these boundaries an election issue. To that we reply: Good. There is nothing we would welcome more. We would enjoy the chance to campaign on this gerrymander and on this deceitful attempt by the Government to keep itself in power forever so that it can wreak more havoc on the community. We know what the voters would say. Once again we see the Prime Minister shooting off his mouth, trying to bluster and bully people into giving him his way. I say this now quite deliberately: If the Prime Minister wants an election, we will welcome it. We will do nothing to prevent it. We would enjoy it. </para>
            <para>I say to the Prime Minister and his supporters: The Government already has the grounds for a double dissolution. We do not apologise for that. He can go to the polls any time. But that is a decision for him and we intend to leave that decision to him. Does he want to face the people now, after the fiascos and fur ores in his own Party room? Will <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cass</inline> be supporting him at the polls? Will his rural rump be on his side? Will this dividend mishmash, this collection of vested interests, these dinosaurs, the brontosaurus of the Cabinet and the brachiosaurus of the Caucus be prepared to put their big black cars and their office suites at risk? I fear they Will not. They fear the people. They know that their hold on office is slipping away from them. But they will deliberately try to keep that hold for as long as they can. But the Prime Minister can ignore them, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> It is he who decides when to have an election. </para>
            <para>If the Prime Minister feels so strongly about his bid to rig the system, he can jump into his white elephant and drive out to Yarralumla and ask for a poll. We will hold open the door of his car for him. Then he can go to the people and ask them if they want Labor to govern forever, because that is what will happen if Labor wins another election and is able to put these Bills on to the statute book. Give Labor absolute control of both Houses of Parliament and we will never be able to vote them out, because the Prime Minister does not want democracy. He wants complete unbridled power. He has already tried to abuse what power he has been given. I ask: Would the voters be prepared to give him more? I answer: They would not. He will not bully the Opposition by threatening us with an election, even though he might be able sometimes to bully his own back bench, and force his own  Deputy  to back down. I say quite openly: We will fight him any time he chooses. If he wants to fight on this gerrymander, then let him fight now. Let him put his job on the Une, if he dares. </para>
            <para>For too long the Prime Minister had bluffed and bullied his way- in the Parliament, in the Cabinet, in the Caucus. Caucus may be afraid of him, Cabinet may be afraid of him, but we are not. We know that he is a man who has deserted his one time friends. Do honourable senators remember Harradine, Crean and Barnard? If the Prime Minister was sincere, if he is the man of courage and principle that his image makers make him out to be, let him show that courage now. Let him go to the polls now on boundaries that are fair and equitable, on boundaries that are not rigged to guarantee him control of the Parliament. We are prepared to call his bluff. Is he man enough to go through with it? </para>

            <para>One wishes at times that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> would revise his speech. He seems to use the same copy but adds a few words each time a redistribution proposal comes into the House. However, one thing was clearer in his speech tonight and that is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> had very seriously charged senior public servants across Australia. He said tonight that the redistribution proposal we have before us is a fiddle, a gerrymander, a fraud and it is deceitful. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the parent legislation, passed by this Parliament, which provided the basis for this redistribution. It provides for none of these things to take place in any redistribution. The parent legislation is entirely fair and no one in this House can say otherwise. It set out the basis for a redistribution with a tolerance of 10 per cent between electorates instead of 20 per cent. Nothing in that legislation makes it a fiddle, a gerrymander, a deceit or a fraud. So if the parent legislation is entirely free of those faults and crimes it must be, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wither&#39;s</inline> definition, the people who drew the boundaries who are responsible for these things. There is no other construction that one can put on the development and evolvement of this redistribution. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline>by his remarks here tonight has charged very serious crimes against the public servants, people of the community in each State. The Chief Electoral Officer in each State is, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wither&#39;s</inline> definition, responsible for producing a deceit and a fraud. This allegation is extremely serious and is a slur of the greatest magnitude on officers of the Public Service for whom I and most Australians have the highest regard. What is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> going to do about his charge? Will he continue to skulk in here, redistribution after redistribution, presentation after presentation, using insults instead of logic, forgetting the public in interpreting his own Party attitudes and so shaming many of his back benchers that they will not come into the House to listen to him? I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> confront these people who created this fraud, that he goes out into the public and charges the public servants with having done so. No one else could have done it. </para>
          <para>The parent legislation is clean, easily interpreted legislation which is fair to every reader of any political persuasion. I believe that it is up to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> to produce real reasons instead of insults to public servants for his continued opposition to what every political writer in the country has said is the fairest redistribution Australia has ever seen. I for one want to be absolutely dissociated from the most unjust, unfair and disgraceful charges that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> made tonight against senior public servants. </para>

However I do not want to develop this long argued issue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> knows that he attended a declaration of the poll relating to the Senate at which one of his running mates said that he did not believe in the principle of one vote one value.

              <para>I do not know why. Why would they not believe that people should be equal under the law? I do not know, except that they have a history of being dominated by the Legislative Council in South Australia, a situation they will never get out of. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> talked exactly like a South Australian Legislative Councillor. The records of Hansard for the last 30 years show the model for his speech year after dismal year. The result, of course, was the depression of the Liberal vote in South Australia on such a permanent basis that there had to be a revolution on the Liberal side to achieve any success. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>I end by saying that it is up to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> to step outside the stereotyped speech he makes in which he hurls insults at others, and of course diminishes his own Party in so doing, and to lay the charges directly where he means them to be- at the feet of the public servants who drew electoral boundaries which are the basis of the fairest of all pieces of legislation. There can be no other construction. I sit down knowing that I sit on a side where the Leader of the Opposition lays charges at the feet of public servants who Crew these boundaries, and I am ashamed of his statement. </para>

            <para>This debate had become a hardy perennial since August of last year when the subject of reform of the Commonwealth electoral laws was dealt with by a Joint Sitting of both Houses of Parliament. The legislation now before the Senate results from that Joint Sitting. The Joint Sitting dealt with electoral legislation, one of the reasons for a double dissolution of the Parliament, and which was one of the election issues put to the people in May 1974. The Joint Sitting decided that the Distribution Commissioners for tie various States should be permitted a variation in the number of electors within a division of 10 per cent above or below the quota instead cf the previously prevailing variation of 20 per cent. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Regrettably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers&#39;</inline> remarks this evening are not a defence of his attitude, his Party&#39;s attitude or the attitude of the National Country Party of Australia to the 5 Electoral Bills hi respect of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania now before the House. He used the debate to launch an unwarranted and uncalled for diatribe of criticism, if not abuse, against the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> We heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> in his typical fashion talk about dinosaurs and brachiosaurs, and at o.ie stage I think he had white elephants opening doors. Frankly, all the remarks by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> concerning the Prime Minister were pointless and irrelevant to the legislation. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HaU</inline> has said, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> by his simple use of the term &#39;gerrymander&#39; and alleging that the legislation now before the House was to protect gerrymanders that had been given up by Distribution Commissioners, that it was legislation of deceit and that it was legislation of fraud, was accusing in one breath and finding guilty in another the independent Distribution Commissioners who have been charged apparently with acting with political bias. </para>
          <para>I do not think that that is fair on the part of the Opposition because in respect of each of the Spates the Distribution Commissioners drew up boundaries for approval by both Houses of the Australian Parliament as a result of a law enacted by both Houses at a Joint Sitting. They acted in accordance with that law and drew the boundaries in accordance with that law. The simple fact is that it is the law- npt the bound&#34; aries but the boundaries based on the law- that does not suit the Country Party and. in some instances, I suppose, the Liberal Party, and therefore the combined Opposition in this chamber has decided to reject the legislation, as it rejected the redistribution proposals a week or so before last week. As my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> who is the representative in this chamber of the Minister for Services and Property, said when the Government introduced the legislation a couple of weeks ago: </para>
          <para>The Government has decided to introduce S separate Bills to implement the Distribution Commissioners&#39; proposed electoral divisions for South Australia, Tasmania, Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. </para>
          <para class="block">Those are the 5 States to which I have referred. He went on to say: </para>
          <para>This action has been taken because of the uncompromising attitude adopted by the Opposition Parties in this chamber towards the redistribution proposals for each of the 5 States concerned. In rejecting all - </para>
          <para class="block">Not one but all- the redistribution proposals, both Opposition Parties have been motivated by their objection to the basic redistribution ground rules as set out in section 19 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, . . . </para>
          <para class="block">Of course, those ground rules must be observed by the Distribution Commissioners when they give consideration to the drawing up of boundaries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> went on to say: </para>
          <para>Accordingly, it is quite clear that there would be no point in the Minister - * </para>
          <para class="block">That is, the Minister for Services and Property- directing the Distribution Commissioners to propose a fresh distribution in the States concerned, as allowed under section 24 (2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. </para>
          <para class="block">No matter how often the Minister referred the matter back to the respective Distribution Commissioners in each of the States the Opposition Parties would reject the proposals, irrespective of the boundaries that were drawn up, whilst they collectively were opposed to the ground rules on which the boundaries were based. The Government does not overlook the possibility, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> said when introducing the legislation, that the Opposition may even choose to reject the Bills themselves. Nevertheless we believe that the redistributions have become a matter of urgent necessity because of the inequality in representation on the boundaries that now exist. We believe that the legislation is of urgent necessity in. order to provide equality of representation for every elector. </para>
          <para>I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> who said that the proposed boundaries embodied in the legislation presently before the Parliament have been described as being the fairest set of redistribution proposals that has ever been presented to the Australian Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Mackerras, the noted electoral analyst, and well known commentator on elections generally, has gone on record as saying: </para>
          <para>In overall political terms, the 1975 redistribution is the fairest set of proposed boundaries ever to be presented to any Australian Parliament in my lifetime. The Commissioners have bent over backwards to avoid any suggestion of gerrymandering. They have set out to draw boundaries so patently fair that rejection by the Senate would reflect discredit on the Senate not on the Commissioners. </para>
          <para class="block">Lest there by any doubt as to the Opposition&#39;s motives in relation to this matter I point out that shortly after the Joint Sitting of both Houses in August 1974 laid down the ground rules for the Distribution Commissioners to follow in their drawing up of the boundaries- within about 6 weeks of the Joint Sitting of both Houses, namely, on 30 September 1974- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony,</inline> the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia, set out in an article in the Melbourne Age&#39; that his Party&#39;s objections to the redistribution were on the grounds that they were premature and unnecessary. The right honourable gentleman was reported in the article which appeared in the Melbourne &#39;Age&#39; of 30 September as having said: </para>
         <para>When the new boundaries are presented to Parliament, every Country Party member and senator will vote against their implementation. We are confident that our Liberal colleagues share our views, and that the proposed boundaries will be defeated in the Senate. </para>
         <para class="block">So well before the Commissioners had drawn the boundaries and long before the boundaries had been presented to this Parliament, the Leader of the National Country Party was saying that irrespective of what boundaries were drawn, because the size of the electorate would be based on a one-tenth variation instead of the previous one-fifth variation the National Country Party and its ally the Liberal Party would reject the legislation in the Senate. </para>
          <para>On past performances, I think we all know the fate of the legislation we are now considering. Nonetheless, we believe a principle of equality is involved and that we should carry out the wishes of the elected representatives of this Parliament. Therefore I suggest that the second reading of the legislation should be agreed to by the Senate. </para>

              <para>The primary purpose of both Bills is to make adjustments to the approved triennial programs to take account of cost variations. In other words, these Bills are required to deal with the cost inflation which has been experienced by tertiary level institutions. For that reason the Bills are not opposed by the Opposition. The fact is that when the Government assumed full responsibility for the funding of tertiary education it entered into an agreement that it would fund cost variations, and that is the purpose of these Bills. We are pleased to see that there is provision in the States Grants (Universities) Bill for the preliminary funding for the Deakin University in Victoria and we welcome the progress that is being made to achieve further tertiary level opportunities for education in that State. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>It is opportune at this time to note that there has been an announcement from the Government of the amalgamation of the tertiary commissions, that is, the amalgamation of the Australian Universities Commission and the Commission on Advanced Education. We will be looking forward to the developments that are undertaken with regard to the merging of the two Commissions and the effect that this will have on the plans for tertiary education in this country in the future. It was of interest to us to see the announcement and it was of interest to read that it had been taken without consultation with the Australian Universities Commission. I take it that deep thought had been given before the amalgamation was announced. As I understand it, it will not affect the funding for the next triennium, for which we are expecting to receive reports in the very near future. </para>
            <para>I want to take this opportunity to ask a question with regard to the funding for tertiary education and how this is handled with the tertiary institutions. I would be interested to have a response from the Special Minister of State <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland)</inline> with regard to what system is operative, when we take for granted that universities and colleges must make some forecast of student intake and courses, which they expect to be undertaken in the forthcoming year or in the triennium. I am wondering what the position will be when admissions are finalised, what the relationship will be between the forecast figures and those which are actually achieved in the courses and the particular studies, what action is to be taken by the tertiary institution to show the relationship between what has been forecast and what has been achieved, and what action is to be taken if minimum numbers for courses as have been forecast are not achieved. I think that in the interests of dealing with the Bills, which are providing for a great deal of additional funds for tertiary education, some response from the Minister with regard to the arrangements that are being made in these circumstances would be welcomed by the Opposition. </para>
            <para>The figures in the 2 Bills represent quite a deal of finance. With regard to the universities we see that $104m is to be applied as additional expenditure. It is an undertaking by Government to fund the increases that have occurred, but it brings to mind the inflation which is evident in the economy that such massive funds are required in addition to those that have already been dealt with through the normal funds in the States Grants (Universities) Bills and the States Grants (Advanced Education) Bills. With these brief remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> the Opposition does not oppose these 2 Bills with which we are dealing. I should be interested to hear the response from the Minister with regard to the funding arrangements. </para>

            <para>The Government is appreciative of the speedy passage being given to these 2 education Bills that are now the subject of debate before the Senate- the States Grants (Advanced Education) Bill 1975 and the States Grants (Universities) Bill 1975. 1 respond briefly to the first point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> when she referred to the lack of consultation with the Universities Commission and the Commission on Advanced Education as a result of the Government&#39;s decision to weld the two into a single statutory body. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> issued a Press statement on the matter on 30 May- about a week ago- which, for the benefit of the record, I shall read. It stated: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Prime Minister, the Honourable E. G. Whitlam, stated today that after consultation with the Minister for Education, the Honourable Kim E. Beazley, he has decided to amalgamate the Universities Commission and the Commission on Advanced Education into a single statutory advisory body to the Australian Government on universities and colleges. </para>
          <para class="block">I interpolate here to indicate that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley)</inline> had consultation on the matter. The Press statement continued: </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister said that notwithstanding the close working relationship which exists between the 2 Commissions the balanced development of the provision of university and advanced education throughout Australia would benefit from the creation of a single body. </para>
          <para>The Secretary of the Department of Education, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr K.</inline> N. Jones, the  Chairman  of the Universities Commission, Professor P. H. Karmel, and the  Chairman  of the Commission on Advanced Education, MrT. B. Swanson, have been asked to recommend how the amalgamation may best be put into effect. The panel, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jones</inline> as convener, will consult with interested parties and will make its recommendations in time for legislative action to be taken during the Budget Session of the Parliament later this year. </para>
          <para class="block">Therefore, both the  Chairman  of the Universities Commission and the  Chairman  of the Commission on Advanced Education will play a prominent part in making recommendations as to how best to give effect to the decision that has been arrived at by the Government as a result of discussions between the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education to weld the 2 bodies into an independent statutory authority. </para>

              <para>It was a decision by the Government and decisions are taken by government. It obviously has been taken as as result of ministerial changes that recently have been implemented. It is a decision taken by government and, that decision having been taken by government- let us face it, government is responsible for making governmental decisions- it will best be carried out as a result of consultation with Professor Karmel and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Swanson.</inline> On the matter of the figures to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> alluded, I am advised by the advising officers sitting alongside me, who come from the Department of Education, that student numbers are predicted triennial by universities and the Commission on Advanced Education. Generally the predictions have been within 2 per cent to 3 per cent of actual numbers and, according to the advice given to me by the departmental offices, there have been only one or two exceptions. Actual numbers are set out in the Commission&#39;s sixth report, which I am advised will be issued shortly. The honourable senator will realise that I am only the Minister representing the Minister for Education. I will certainly endeavour to obtain from the Department of Education for the honourable senator any additional information that might be available in the Department concerning figures. As I have said, the Government appreciates the speedy passage that the Opposition is giving to these 2 important pieces of education legislation. </para>

            <para>This Bill will result in an agreement between the Federal Government and the Government of South Australia with respect to a proposal that the Australian Government take over the rural railway system, certain workshops and other matters concerned with that railway system in South Australia. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bishop)</inline> will recall that at the time the Australian National Railways Bill was debated in this chamber I said to him that it was regrettable that the Senate had not been given an opportunity to discuss the suggested terms of agreement for such railway takeovers because I felt that such an agreement must form the basis of future takeovers by the Australian Government should they be requested by a particular State. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Already we have seen the reaction of the Tasmanian Government with respect to the proposal of taking over railways in that State. I understand that the Legislative Council in Tasmania expressed some reservations about it. I believe that the Bill before the Senate is currently being debated in the State Assembly in South Australia, I have spoken with members of the Opposition in that State and they have already demonstrated some reservations about this Bill. They have every reason to be concerned about it. Firstly, the State Government has no mandate to ask the Federal Government to take over the rural rail system in that State. On that ground alone I think that the State Parliament and the Legislative Council in particular would be justified in rejecting this Bill outright. I had a word with the Postmaster-General the other day and suggested that it was possible that amendments will arise as a result of the debate in the State Parliament on this Bill and that it might be prudent in the interests of time in this pressing end of session period that he defer the BUI until the August session. I am certain that the chamber will be     debating this matter again at that time. </para>
          <para>I believe that reservations could be held by the South Australian Government quite properly over the proposal to take over one part of the railway system in isolation. The Minister will recall that after the debate on the Australian National Railways Bill in this place the trade union attitude in South Australia was one of hostility to the proposal. It appeared to me, according to Press statements that I have read, that the trade union movement was certainly not happy about the taking over of the rural railway lines in South Australia in isolation from the urban system. Its comment at that time was that the Aus.tralian Government ought to take over the whole system or none of it at all. I think this attitude could well be the one that would be adopted by the State Parliament if the proposal in that direction goes through the Legislative Council. </para>
          <para>Other matters that I have immediately in my mind question the attitude of the State Opposition to providing the railway lines in South Australia in those rural areas with an unfair advantage over private land transport operators, particularly in country areas. The Minister will be aware of the fact that in South Australia, as I have no doubt in other States, the road transport operators are required to pay road tax into the State coffers. Does the Australian Government intend to pay into the State Government Treasury in South Australia from railway revenue a sum equivalent to the road tax demanded of private land transport operators in that State? This in my view seems to be a logical question that would be raised in the minds of members of the State Opposition in South Australia. There are many other matters that ought to be questioned. For example clause 10 of the Bill states: </para>
          <para>On and after the declared date, the Commission may- </para>
          <para>(a) administer, maintain and operate in South Australia the railways and services acquired under the agreement; and </para>
          <para>(b) construct and extend railways in South Australia in accordance with the Agreement and administer,  maintain and operate railways so constructed or extended and services (including passenger and freight road services) incidental or supplementary to, or associated with, those railways. </para>
          <para class="block">That is another area of concern that I have in mind, and I am sure that my colleagues in the State Parliament would share my concern on this particular matter. It seems to me that the Australian Government would be in a position to take over or run road passenger and freight services in South Australia to supplement the services of the railways. I believe that there is a danger here to private road contractors who have been providing a good service to South Australians over a long period of time. This Bill seems to me to add up to the usual incompetent bull at agate system of this Government. I believe that in this Bill the Government is placing the cart before the horse. It seems to me to be a quite reasonable suggestion to put to the Minister that the State governments ought to have been consulted with respect to this Agreement before it was discussed in this chamber. </para>
          <para>I point out these things to the Minister because it seems to me that we are going to be faced with another debate on this issue in this chamber. I was talking this afternoon to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the House of Assembly in South Australia, the Honourable John Combe and he told me that the Opposition in that House had considered this Agreement and was going to vote against it completely. I do not know what will be the attitude of the Upper House because it will consider its legislation in its own way and will review it in a responsible manner, as it has done with legislation in the past. I believe that there are some members in that chamber who will share the view of the Assembly Opposition and may choose to reject the legislation completely. If they do not do that, then it is inevitable that they will bring amendments before the chamber, and the Senate will be faced with another debate in August. </para>
          <para>I do not think there is anything more I need say about this measure. I believe that I will have another opportunity to speak on it when it is re-presented to the Senate. I do suggest to the Minister that he would have been well advised to delay the discussion of this Bill until the August sittings, when the Senate would have been in a position to determine the wishes of the State Parliament on this matter. </para>

              <para>I refer to Tasmania only because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> raised it. He said that he was concerned about the reaction in Tasmania. As far as the Australian Government and the South Australian Government are concerned- I have discussed with the South Australian Government the amendments which have been moved in Tasmania- neither Government is concerned about them because all that they do in fact is ensure that the Minister in that State and/or the Parliament will be aware of what might happen in relation to the closing down of railway lines or in relation to freights and fares. Perhaps I should read what has been inserted. Clause 9 of the Tasmanian Bill reads as follows: </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>It is hereby declared by the Parliament that freight rates applying to the railways in the State are of concern to the State and the State shall request the Australian Minister or his delegate to consult with the State on all proposals to fix or vary those rates and, in any such consultation, shall maintain the view that those rates should not be fixed at a higher level than those applying to railways of the Commonwealth outside the State. </para>
            <para class="block">Clause 10 of the same Bill reads: </para>
            <para>Where, by resolution, either House of Parliament declares that the cessation of any railway service is undesirable the State shall, unless that resolution be rescinded, dispute the cessation of that service by the Australian Commission. </para>
            <para class="block">Consequently where the closing down of a line is involved the matter would be taken to arbitration and the Parliament and the State Government would know about it. </para>
            <para>In my opinion the position in South Australia is quite different. The South Australian Government and the Australian Government have reached a very amicable agreement. I think the terms of the agreement are very favourable to the South Australian Government. Paragraph 8(1) of the Schedule to the Bill reads: 8(1) The Commission will ensure that, in general, fares, freight rates and other charges in respect of the non metropolitan railways and services shall be maintained, on and after the commencement date, at levels not less favourable to users than those levels generally applying on the railways of States other than South Australia and where, in general, fares, freight rates and other charges at the commencement date have established a relative advantage to the users, that advantage shall not be diminished. </para>
            <para class="block">If honourable senators care to read the other principles set out in that Schedule they will find that it is a very favourable agreement. I think the agreement favours South Australia. The agreement was reached with a State in which the railway systems are very well developed and are based, as everybody knows, on basic productive capacity particularly at the Islington workshop which has a long history dating back to the days of rehabilitation when I worked there in 1927 and when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Webb,</inline> the American, brought </para>
            <para class="block">American methods of production into the railway system. That South Australian railway system with about 10 000 kilometres of track is a very advanced system, and the agreement is related to such a system. Provision is made for guarantees which should apply. They are the benefits to the State. </para>
            <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline>talked about the early reactions of the unions to the proposed takeover. The unions met the Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jones,</inline> on 2 occasions and in addition the State Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Virgo,</inline> has talked to the unions. I am told that at present the unions are in favour of the agreement. They think the proposal is an improvement. As honourable senators know, the State employees will in future be members of the Australian National Railways. The whole of the agreement has to be looked at on the basis of existing losses, which are tremendous. For example, the loss for non-metropolitan railways in South Australia for the forthcoming year is estimated to be as high as $23m. Under the agreement South Australia will receive an amount of $10m for the conveyance of assets, mineral rights, etc., to the national Government. As far as I am aware the South Australian Government and the union movement are very happy with the arrangements. There will of course be an interim period during which the transfer has to be executed. There has to be some general co-ordination in the transference of such things as classifications, safe working rules, and train control procedures to adjust to Commonwealth standards. I have had conversations recently with the Government and with the unions as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> had mentioned and I am satisfied that what has been done in respect of South Australia has been favourably received. </para>
            <para>In relation to the question of road transport, I would like to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> of something of which he is well aware. Any raU system in any part of the country always has had to pay for its own road works and earth works. It is not so with road transport. The various States impose various road charges in an attempt to recover from the road users, including the operators of the very heavy vehicles which carry freight which aU of us often consider ought to be on the railways, the cost of maintenance of the highways. I think it is fair to state that in no way do those charges cover the cost of highways. State railway systems have to pay for their own road works and often they have road services competing against them, often running alongside the railways. One frequent criticism is that there is a lack of co-ordination and in these days this situation really is quite illogical. </para>
            <para>As to the other matters relating to road competition which might concern the honourable senator, he will recall that when the first memorandum of agreement came into the Senate it was pointed out that we had accepted an agreement which was opposed by the Opposition in the other place, which made it clear that the road services which would be developed, operated and used by the rail system would be those which are incidental to the system. We all know that the railway road services are run in conjunction with various train movements. They have to have a road system. Road motor sections operate satisfactorily in many States. Of course they are restricted under the State Acts and they will be restricted under the Federal Act because we have accepted, as all honourable senators know, an arrangement which was proposed as a criticism. </para>
            <para>I think those are the main things to which I want to refer. If honourable senators are doubtful about the benefits of the agreement to South Australia they should look at the detailed Schedule at the back of the Bill. It is a most exhaustive statement and it developed from conferences with the South Australian authorities. I think the details are more particular and specific in the case of the agreement with South Australia because the rail system in that State is much larger. The agreement guarantees, for example, the strengthening of the line from Adelaide to Murray Bridge and also refers to matters relating to the outer harbour connection to the future container berths. There are other matters relating to the South Australian system. The agreement is more particular because the South Australian system is much larger than the Tasmanian system. The rail mileage in Tasmania is about 2000 as compared with 10 000 miles in South Australia. I thank the Senate for its comments. </para>

            <para>I understand and agree completely with the principle of the Australian Government taking over interstate railway systems. I do not think a great amount of argument could be presented against that proposition. I believe it is an area where the Australian Government could effect some economies. However, I can see that questions would arise in the minds of South Australian members of Parliament, particularly those in the Opposition who exert some responsibility in regard to this matter, about administrative difficulties presented by the Australian Government taking over the rural railway lines alone, divorced completely from the urban railway system. I should like the Minister to consider that aspect and tell me how he will ensure that there is to be a smooth functioning between those 2 systems in South Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister referred to matters of detail contained in certain schedules in the latter part of the Bill. Here I believe is a case in point where these matters of detail must demand comment from and approval of the State Parliament. I must remind the Minister that there has been no mandate for this proposal. It seems to me that the Australian Government always throws up to us on this side of the chamber that it has a mandate to do this and to do that. But surely the State Parliament must have some mandate from the people, enunciated in the election speech of the Premier of South Australia, to request the Aus.tralian Government to take over this section of the railways. In my view that highlights the concern that could arise and has arisen in the minds of Opposition members of the State Parliament with respect to this measure. </para>
          <para>I must say that I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the road transport systems which are affected by this Bill will be incidental to the existing railway systems. I should like the Minister&#39;s assurance that the Government has no thought of taking over other private road transport systems in South Australia. These matters are of concern to me and to my colleagues in South Australia. Another aspect I should like to mention is that as I understand it the South Aus.tralian railways is obliged to pay some payroll tax to the State Treasury. I realise that this is probably a book entry and somewhat of an accounting fiddle, but it is nevertheless significant in the minds of my State colleagues. I wish to know what the Australian Government intends doing in that respect because I understand that the Commonwealth is not obliged to pay payroll tax in any case. </para>

            <para>The first thing I wish to say is that what the State Government might do is a matter for the State Government or the State Parliament. The State Government has made the agreement with the Commonwealth Government. It has been presented to me as a most favourable agreement to the South Aus.tralian Government. The Bill authorising the agreement has to go before the South Australian Parliament. It may be that the South Australian legislature might seek some new assurances or might seek to amend the Bill. But I should think it is generally known that the railways are a great liability to the States and that the States are finding it almost impossible now to cope with the general debts of the railway systems. The railways are carrying out the function of developing the States and providing general commuter services at great costs and the States are finding it hard to recover those costs by increasing revenues. That applies to all the States. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Many innovations have been started in the States to try to recover the position. We know that in New South Wales the railways incur hundreds of millions of dollars of deficit each year. In the other Sates there are great deficits. In Victoria <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bill</inline> Gibbs is trying to introduce new methods of vehicle use and certain new tariff changes to encourage people to use the railways. But generally speaking, as everybody knows it is like all public transport. People still tend to use their own vehicles to get to and from work. The States have to provide public transport. The Aus.tralian Government said that we would encourage, and in fact invest large sums of money in, public transport. In addition we told the States that if they wished we would take over their railway systems. That is what we have done. </para>
          <para>In the schedules of the agreement with the States honourable senators will see that in respect of the 3 most important matters the States can object and they can go to arbitration if they wish, if the arrangements are wrong. In respect of fares and freights they can say that the provisions do not suit them. As I have said, under the provisions of principle 8 honourable senators will see that the conditions are to be no less favourable than those existing in the other Commonwealth or State railway services. In addition, if there is a benefit to user that benefit has to be obtained even when the National Railway runs the line. There is access to arbitration in the case of disputes when the national government might decide to close down lines. There is an obligation that generally there should be at least an equivalent service. </para>

              <para>Yes. There has to be a procedure of improvements. If the State Government is not satisfied with those trends to improve the service it can take the matter to arbitration. The honourable senator will see from the Schedule that the principles are quite specific. The Australian Government has to invest large sums of money in this system. I suppose the last answer is that this is finally a matter for the State Parliament, as it is with our Parliament, to say whether there might be some follow up. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>As I have mentioned in relation to the first point, in Tasmania there has been a follow up which is not worrying the Australian Government. I understand that it is not worrying the Tasmanian Government. So I think, aU things considered, everybody realises that these things cannot be done overnight. Anybody who knows the railway system knows full well that it will take some time for the State system to be merged into a national system. We know that generally speaking most States, once they are satisfied that there is not a general takeover by the Australian Government, are happy for their systems to be merged with the national railway enterprise. Of course, that is the sort of thing about which most railway engineers have been thinking for many years. They want an Australian railway system and not different railway systems in the various States. </para>

            <para>I was interested to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> say that there may be opposition in South Australia to the Railways (South Australia) Bill. I have read reports that one or two Legislative Councillors have said that they do not approve of this transfer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Jessop may know more about this matter than I do. Certainly this indicates that the BUI may not obtain an automatic passage through the South Australian Parliament. I mention a matter in the Schedule. It relates to clause 8, rates and charges. We have a very important line in South Australia and that is the Broken Hill line. That line has been the main conveyance of ores from the fabulously rich Broken HU1 to Port Pirie for treatment and shipment overseas. The upgrading of that line and its standardisation were of great importance during the Gorton Government and other Liberal governments. I think the link was formalised during the Gorton Administration. At all times the freight rate that is charged by the South Australian Railways for the conveyance of that ore is a vital factor in the success of the Broken Hill mines and the smelters which are dependent on that ore. Any sudden and substantial rise in that rate would cause chaos to that extremely large industry. Therefore I look with some interest at clause 8 of the Schedule, which states: </para>
          <para>( 1 ) The Commission will ensure that, in general, - </para>
          <para class="block">I stress the words &#39;in general &#39;- fares, freight rates and other charges in respect of the non-metropolitan railways and services shall be maintained, on and after the commencement date, at levels not less favourable to users than those levels generally applying on the railways of States other than South Australia and where, in general, fares, freight rates and other charges at the commencement date have established a relative advantage to the users, that advantage shall not be diminished. </para>
          <para class="block">It seems to me the words that govern this matter are &#39;in general&#39;. I am talking about the particular. There is a very special rate for the companies which transport ore on this vital link, which is now a high grade link having been standardised under the previous arrangements in the 1960s. As I read that clause, the rates to be charged will be those not less favourable to users in other States. That is the only particular application. Otherwise we are dealing with general rates which would not safeguard the rate that is charged for transport from the Broken Hill mines. This is vital to the economy of South Australia and to Broken Hill. </para>
          <para>I have not any comparisons because it would be most difficult to obtain them, but I am sure that the Department of Transport can obtain them. I am sure that members of the South Aus.tralian Parliament Will ask this very fair question: What Will be the possible alterations to the ore charge from Broken Hill? I know that the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bishop)</inline> will understand what I am saying because he is a South Australian. I am sure that the companies would want to know what they will be up for. I see the reference to &#39;in general&#39; as being very important wording which may disadvantage these companies if they have to pay a rate such as that which is being charged interstate in respect of Mt Isa. This is something on which the South Australian Parliament will want to be assured. While I am sure that the Postmaster-General cannot give us all that detail tonight, if the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> is to get this legislation through the South Australian Parliament he will have to produce the figures, he will have to be convincing about the matter and he will have to assure the South Australian Parliament that the industry will not be disadvantaged in that respect. </para>
          <para>I wish to refer to sub-clause 8 (3) of the Schedule. I thought that South Australia was getting rid of responsibility for these railways, not for physical reasons, because the State is best able to build, maintain and run railways, but for financial reasons. If South Australia is divesting itself of the responsibility for the country railway system for financial reasons it seems that the State would have a continuing obligation under subclause 8(3), which states: </para>
          <para>The State will reimburse the Commission the reasonable cost to the Commission as agreed between the parties, of the passenger concessions continued pursuant to sub-clause (2 ). </para>
          <para class="block">Sub-clause (2) states: </para>
          <para>Passenger concessions that exist in respect of the non metropolitan railways at the date of this agreement shall continue after the declared date so far as they lawfully may do so. </para>
          <para class="block">As I see the matter, the existing concessions, which are of an immense nature per ticket purchased, must continue and the Commonwealth will not pay for them. I find this rather peculiar. I thought that the State was getting rid of responsibility for these railways against its will, in a sense. We in South Australia had no reason suddenly to say: &#39;Here, take something we do not like&#39;. Despite a few troubles we are rather proud of our system there&#39;. I thought it was for a financial reason that we were getting rid of the railway system. No doubt the overall debt is immense and there will be great advantages financially to South Australia, but there is on the tail of this agreement an unending and growing burden to pay the difference between the actual cost and the cost charged for the conveyance of country passengers. The last figure given in this respect, and I stand to be corrected, was a subsidy of $13 or $14 per ticket purchased on average by a country passenger in South Australia. As I see it, the Schedule is loaded against the State and the State has to continue paying this subsidy. Perhaps there is some other factor but that is as I read the clause and I would like the Minister to explain it to the Committee. </para>

            <para>I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> raised the question of freight rates in relation to clause 8. He is right in pointing out that the economic welfare and viability of Broken Hill Associated Smelters Pty Ltd at Port Pirie are dependent very largely, if not entirely, on the advantageous rates that are being obtained on that railway line at present. I question the Minister on whether concessions for pensioner passengers on the railway line will continue. </para>

              <para>I was not there with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Virgo</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jones</inline> to consummate the agreement. There are many lines in South Australia on which relatively concessional freight rates are allowed to users in the non-metropolitan area, and this includes the Broken Hill line. It is good traffic, intensive traffic. Of course, the Australian Government would not want to impede that railway traffic. The intention of this provision, 1 am advised and I can see it clearly, is that where there has been a user advantage that advantage shall continue, but in such a document as this one could not specify such matters. I can think of a dozen concessional freight agreements in South Australia in regard to various users. They cannot all be specified. If the South Australian Parliament decides that those details ought to be written into a memorandum, it has the right to do it. </para>

              <para>I am just having a good guess. When railways contract to run a service or to lift a special cargo, whether it be steel, superphosphate or iron ore, they offer various concessional rates on runs where the traffic is good. The intention of the Bill, as can be seen, is to guarantee that the user gets any advantage. That was set out in the memorandum presented to the Senate. </para>

            <para>It seems to me that the position under the Agreement whereby the Australian National Railways Commission will take over railways in South Australia will be better than it is at the present time. At the present time a number of railway lines are being closed down in all States. I remember that when former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> was a member of the Tasmanian State Parliament a number of Tasmanian railway lines were closed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> went on the hustings with the secretary of the railways union in that State to circumvent the closing down of lines. Not all his efforts were successful. Little can be done if a State government decides to close down a line. Members of Parliament can agitate in their electorates and make representations in the Parliament. That goes on every day. The Agreement in the BUI we are discussing sets out clearly a new prescription which, as far as I am aware, is not to be found in any State legislation dealing with railways. It states: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Australian Minister will obtain the prior agreement of the State Minister to- </para>
          <para>(a) any proposal for the closure of a railway line of the non-metropolitan railways; or </para>
          <para>(b) the reduction in the level of effectively demanded services on the non-metropolitan railways, and failing agreement on any of these matters the dispute shall be determined by arbitration. </para>
          <para class="block">There is an acknowledgement in that- the acknowledgement was made before the Bill was introduced- that the South Australian Government had to have a guarantee that once the transfer of its railways to the Australian Government had been effected the national Government could not close down lines, or could not close them down easily, anyway. Before that could be done the State Minister must agree to the closure. It was agreed that if the State .Minister did not agree to the closure then the matter had to go to arbitration and be argued. The matters about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> talked would be matters for arbitration. </para>

            <para>I am not so worried about the closing down of railway lines because from time to time there will have to be a closure of lines. In some ways I hope that the Australian Government, because it is further removed from the local scene, will be able to look at matters more objectively and overcome some of the difficulties with which the State administrations are faced when they are hard pushed electorally and are unable to make sensible decisions about closures because of local feeling. As the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bishop)</inline> probably would be aware, very important illustrations are available of how difficult it is to close lines; yet how right it often is to do so. I remember what happened in 1969 when the South Australian Government closed down a substantial number of services. Petitions containing the signatures of up to 2000 people were received. Those people were crying out in a very sentimental fashion about the closing down of lines; yet when one looked at the usage one found that only seven to nine people were using those very expensive trains each day. Of course, when the trains were taken off the run and were replaced by faster, more convenient and flexible bus services at a cheaper cost than that at which the railways could provide a service it was found that the public would not like the return of the rail systems. So I think that as long as there is an arbitrator perhaps there will be a more effective economic approach to closures than when parochial problems confront State governments. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am still worried about the particular point I have raised. I cannot do any more than express my worries and sit down because we will not get anywhere with them tonight. I am not criticising the Minister for that. What I am really saying is that the future administrators of this legislation will not place any reliance on the goodwill expressed tonight by the Postmaster-General. I am sure that the Postmaster-General has expressed goodwill because he is a loyal South Aus.tralian. I do not doubt that at all. In raising the issue I am not being critical of him; I am simply saying that in clause 8 of the Schedule I see possible danger to the specific advantages now held. I just want to have that put down. I ask the Postmaster-General to read it in a quieter moment. As I have said, he can do that after the Bill has been passed because that does not affect its passage now. If the Postmaster-General reads clause 8 he will find that sub-clause ( 1 ) is really divided into 2 parts. It states that the Commission will ensure that, in general, fares, freight rates and other charges in respect of the non metropolitan railways and services shall be maintained and then it goes on to talk about it being on a not less favourable basis than the other States. Then, still using the words &#39;in general&#39;, it says that where the fares, freight rates and other charges at the commencement date have established a relative advantage to the users that advantage shall not be diminished. </para>
          <para>What does &#39;in general&#39; mean? The clause does not say &#39;in particular&#39;. If I were drafting that to mean what the Postmaster-General would like it to mean and what I would like it to mean I would say &#39;in particular&#39; and not &#39;in general&#39; because I am sure that in the future some person, if he wanted to vary the rates against the present users, could say: &#39;It mentions &#34;in general&#34; and you, on the Broken Hill line, are not &#34;in general&#34;- you are &#34;in particular&#34;. You have a particular contract for a particular product from a particular part of New South Wales. You are not &#34;in general&#34;.&#39; I am just saying that if someone wants to play around in the future he would have an &#39;in&#39; there. I do not expect the Postmaster-General to reply to my comments because it is not something that we can alter tonight, but I imagine that it could cause trouble for the South Australian Parliament. </para>

            <para>The Opposition does not oppose this Bill which will give force and effect to an agreement entered into between the Commonwealth of Australia- I am pleased to note that the agreement specifies &#39;the Commonwealth of Australia&#39; which is the proper legal title, and not &#39;Australia&#39; as this Government is so keen on calling itself- and the State of Tasmania. As we are all aware the Commonwealth Government, by virtue of section 5 1 (xxxiii) of the Constitution has the power of acquisition, with the consent of a State, of any railways of the State on terms arranged between the Commonwealth and the State. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>On 23 May 1975 the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Tasmania entered into an agreement whereby the railways of Tasmania would be transferred to the Commonwealth of Australia. Bills of the type that we are now considering always present some difficulty, especially when they come into the Senate, in that they are designed to give confirmation to an agreement entered into between 2 governments. Therefore parliaments tend to be somewhat reluctant to interfere with agreements entered into by two separate governments, especially between governments of the Commonwealth and the States. It is even more difficult, of course, when both Houses of the Parliament of the State of Tasmania have passed, as I assume, a Bill for an Act to give force and effect to this agreement. Therefore it is with some reservations and recommendations therein that the Opposition does not oppose the Bill. </para>
          <para>Of course, the other side of the coin is that the Senate has a duty to see that the rights of the States are not submerged totally in this matter. But, as I say, this is a difficult area. If, of course, the Parliament of Tasmania had not confirmed the legislation Tasmanian senators may have been far more critical of the legislation as it concerns their State. Whether or not their State got as good a deal as it might have done is another problem. This is a matter for which the Government of Tasmania will eventually be accountable to its electors. If the criticism of the  Hon.  Max Bingham, Q.C, the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of Tasmania, is valid the State Government will pay the penalty for that at the next election. But tonight we are faced with the situation of the Senate being asked, as the fourth House of the 2 Parliaments, to give its approval to an agreement entered into between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Tasmania. That is the reason why the Opposition will support the Bill. </para>
          <para>One could deliver an interesting philosophical discourse on whether the powers which the constitutional fathers had in mind in 1 900 are still as valid in 1 975. All I can hope is that as a result of the legislation which will be passed this night, the people of Tasmania will in fact be better off than they are at present. That is something which will be decided in the future. I just hope for myself personally and I think for all my colleagues that the great hopes that the Government has, that this Bill will in fact be for the betterment of the people of Tasmania, will come to pass. But if those hopes do not come to fruition I think it will then be a matter for the electorate of Tasmania to use its judgment in relation to the people it elects at both the State level and the Federal level. With those comments I again indicate that we will support the Bill. </para>

              <name role="display">Senator DEVITT</name>
            </talker>
            <para>I was pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> indicate to the chamber that the Opposition will not be opposing the Railways (Tasmania) Bill 1975 because, as he rightly pointed out, to do so would be to fly in the face of an agreement proposed to be entered into between the Government of Tasmania and the Commonwealth, as he puts it. I think it would be desirable if, for the sake of the record, I were to indicate as briefly as I possibly could the principal purposes of this legislation. On my summary of the Bill there are in fact what could be regarded as 1 1 main points. The first relates to the agreement which is embodied in the Schedule to the Bill. The agreement provides for an interim period commencing on 1 July when the Australian Government accepts financial responsibility for the Tasmanian Railways and has the assets of the railways vested in it. The second point is that the interim period will terminate with the transfer of the railway staff to the Aus.tralian National Railways Commission, and during that period the Tasmanian Transport Commission will administer the railways on behalf of the Australian National Railways but subject to the direction and control of the Australian National Railways. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The third point is that the agreement provides for the Australian National Railways to operate ancillary services in Tasmania and to extend its railways where necessary. On that point, I would just indicate to the Senate that in recent years one quite important extension to the railway system has already been made to provide principally for the needs of the wood chip industry in that State. The purpose of the extension was to provide a rail track from Launceston to the Bell Bay area on the Tamar River to enable the transportation of substantial quantities of chipping timber to that region. More recently, a proposal is under consideration for an extension to a section of the railway system in the vicinity of Devonport to service the requirements of the Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd complex at Wesley Vale. I commend these propositions as indicating that the railway system generally still has a very useful and worthwhile purpose to serve in the Aus.tralian community. The fourth point is that provision is also made for a continuation of concessions presently available on the railways if the State so requests, provided that the State meets the same proportion of its costs as was provided before the transfer. </para>
          <para>Fifthly, in the case of a dispute arising between the Australian and Tasmanian governments on payments for concessions and cessation of services on the railway, provision has been made for settlement by arbitration. The sixth point to be made is that because of the importance of sea trade to Tasmania- sea trade is of extreme importance to the State of Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> as you, being a Tasmanian senator, would know- and because of the integration of the systems of rail transportation and sea transportation to bring them into the mainland systems as we know them, the Government&#39;s declared intention is to have greater coordination which would be absolutely essential in this situation, between the Australian National Railways and the Australian National Line. Provision has been made for Tasmanian nominees to join both the Australian Shipping Commission and the Australian National Railways Commission. So we can see the association of those 2 systems of transport is so important that it has been considered by the 2 governments in consultation that there ought to be a combination of the relationship of those 2 systems. Both of these appointments will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Transport and are provided for in clause 9 of the Agreement. </para>
          <para>I come to the seventh point. At present the Tasmanian Transport Commission operates a precision tool annexe at Launceston. Although its buildings are situated on railway land, the annexe is not part of the railway operations. It services the operations of the railways, but the annexe is not essentially part of the functioning of the railway system. Consequently, it has been decided that the annexe will remain with the Tasmanian Government. Clause 19 provides for this and for the eventual removal of the annexe from railway land, possibly within a period of 10 years. There is to be no great urgency about this. I make the point in passing that this is a very fine complex. It is capable of turning out some high quality machinery work and work of that nature. As a matter of fact, in recent years substantial progress has been made with the development of the diesel locomotive system. I was very pleased a few years ago to see the capacity of the railway workshops at Launceston, alongside the tool annexe, to manufacture many of the parts in the diesel system implemented into the Tasmanian railway system generally. It was a fine piece of work and it is a very great tribute to the workmen there and to the capacity of the organisational setup to be able to undertake and faithfully execute that work. </para>
          <para>The eighth point relates to the provision in clause 14 for the payment to Tasmania of $5m in consideration of land, minerals and other assets when both the Australian and Tasmanian parliaments ratify the necessary legislation to approve the Agreement. Clause 15, which deals with the ninth point, provides for the taking over by the Australian Government of a specific portion of the railway debt. The tenth point, which is embodied within clause 16, refers to the interim period during which any loss in connection with the railways will be borne by the Australian Railways Commission and any profits will be paid to the Commission, and that is a reasonable enough proposition. Finally, clause 17 is intended to ensure continuity of superannuation to any transferred employees. As I see it, that crystallises the main purpose of the Bill. The clause is designed to give effect to this Agreement reached between the 2 governments to enable a system to be taken over and integrated into the national railway system to the benefit, it is believed, of Tasmania, the railway system itself and, I would hope, to the benefit of those people who work in the service of the railway system currently under the control of Tasmania </para>
          <para>There is presently proceeding an inquiry by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> F. Jimmy into Transport Charges to and from Tasmania as they relate to the transport costs of Tasmania. I will not go into great detail. I think that honourable senators are aware of the purposes of this inquiry, that is, to endeavour to provide to Tasmania, as the Australian Government has undertaken, a system of transportation the cost of which does not exceed the per ton mile cost of freight rates in the other States of the Commonwealth. So here again we see the relationship between the Tasmanian raU system and that of the mainland States. Of course, I would expect this relativity to wipe out the disability of freight costs when the sea-raU services are used. As I think everybody would concede, the rau ways have played a tremendous part in the development of this country. They are a public transport system which I suppose we all accept is one of those systems which does not pay. It has been a good old whipping post for a great many people over the years when those people have set out to criticise the budgets of those States controlling and running a railway system when the annual accounts of the States have revealed the condition of the finances of those railway systems. </para>
          <para>I think that never in an argument of that kind is any credibility given to the tremendous role which has been played by the railway systems in the development of this country. In fact I would go so far as to say that had there not been a rau way system over the years in my State of Tasmania, serving the outlying areas back into the bush and back into the developing farmlands, the progress that has been made in those regions would not have been so great as it has been. Those areas still would have been using the road systems which would have had to bear the additional load imposed upon them because of the absence of an alternative system. The road systems would have been in a much worse condition than we see some of them at present. I think it is necessary and tremendously important to maintain the railway systems so that the load, the rate of usage and consequent destruction of the road systems of the various States can be limited, at least to that degree. </para>
          <para>I see in this proposition an opportunity to upgrade the raU tracks and also upgrade and modernise the rolling stock in the Tasmanian railway system. Most people hail Tasmania as a place with tremendous tourist potential. For a number of years, especially since it has been my privilege to visit other countries, to see the sorts of things that are going on and to view the tourist attractions, I have thought that there is a tremendous potential in Tasmania if we could only use it. This involves substantial financial commitments for the development of a quite magnificent railway system. That is perhaps something for the future. I mention it now as something which could be achieved were all the other problems associated with the financing and the development of these systems able to be overcome. Right throughout the country and in fact throughout the world there is the problem of what is to be done with motor transport, particularly in the urban areas. This is worrying every city in this country. I think if we were not to endeavour to keep railway systems alive and progressing with the times we would tend to aggravate and add to the problems. This is perplexing all the urban authorities at present. </para>
          <para>I saw during a world tour a couple of years ago the potential for the development of a railway system. I am talking about the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which has highly developed railway systems in the urban areas which, in fact, are paying propositions. I know that the circumstances in the USSR and here are vastly different. I wish to point out the possibility that railway systems do not have to be losing propositions all the time if they are properly utilised and developed. As time goes on, particularly in the urban areas where the problem of traffic is becoming increasingly difficult, we may have to turn more and more to the use of railway systems for the carriage of commuters to their various duties in the principal areas of population. </para>
          <para>I have mentioned already the role of the railways in opening up the country. I am quite certain when we talk about the merits of the operations of private and public enterprise that private enterprise would not take on many of the undertakings that have been carried out by the railway systems of this country. The railway systems are not paying propositions, as I think I mentioned earlier, and therefore they are not attractive to private enterprise. So, credit for much of the progress of this country can be laid at the door of the railway systems. I am reminded also in my thoughts about this general proposition that the railways on many occasions have further jeopardised their chances of showing any sort of reasonable balance sheet by coming to the aid of various sections of the community. For instance, a few years ago the Tasmanian Government adopted the principle of payment of a certain amount of subsidy on the transport of, I think, agricultural lime to service the farming communities. That could not have been undertaken by private enterprise. But the railways reached out into those country regions and it was possible for the railways to provide that service to the country areas and so, to a degree at least, keep the price of that very necessary commodity especially necessary in the high rainfall areas- at a level that could be met by the farming community. </para>
          <para>We are coming closer together all the time, with the frequency and the speed of carriage of goods across the continent these days. I do not think that any State can be isolated from the principal transport system- the railway system. Whether the proposal before us turns out to be financially good or financially not so good for Tasmania, I think that the general question of the integration and the relationship of transport systems is such that we cannot stay out any longer. I hope that the Jimmy report will come down shortly. If it is not possible to have the full report of the Jimmy inquiry, it might be possible to obtain an interim report which will give some indication of the fact that there will be a continuation of the present arrangement of assistance for the freight rate on goods exported from Tasmania. Pretty well all of those goods go by ship, and the ships are to a very substantial degree serviced by the railway system of Tasmania. I think that the ability to arrive at that point will be enhanced by the proposal embodied in this Bill, namely, by the integration of the rail and sea Way systems. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> indicated, one could perhaps speak at some length on many of these points. I do not want to protract the debate. I am very pleased indeed to note that the Opposition is accepting this proposition and will not oppose it. I commend the proposal as something worthwhile, particularly in the interests of my State of Tasmania and in the interests of the transportation of goods in this continent generally. </para>

              </talker>
            <para>This Bill comes to us out of a crisis which inevitably was to face the Government of Tasmania. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reece,</inline> the former Premier, fell upon the misfortune of trying to manoeuvre the finances of Tasmania, and the country will remember that when he tried to extricate himself from the political debacle that the tobacco tax represented to him, he withdrew his State from the authority of the Grants Commission and then he decided to go it alone in consideration of an increased reimbusement. Of course, we on our side of politics said: &#39;He is not reckoning with the future as to the railway crisis. The losses in it alone will need underwriting by the Commonwealth&#39;. The Commonwealth has now taken advantage of that crisis and has said: &#39;You are completely within my monetary control. Make a bargain with us. Sell us your railways&#39;. That is what has been done. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Tasmania abandons all control. There are a few phrases in the agreement that are tokens of giving Tasmania some authority over the continued operation of the railways, but they are completely ineffective and operate merely as tokens. In 1970-71 the loss on the Tasmanian railways was $3.9m, and in the last year the commercial loss on the railways was $ 1 5m according to my latest information. So honourable senators see the predicament that is now facing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson,</inline> the present Premier pro tern of Tasmania. The financial losses of the railways are such that he will be submerged unless he gets rid of them. He has yielded to the theme of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> that the best thing for all Labor State politicians to do is to scuttle themselves. That was the proposition that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> put to them some 10 years ago. With regard to the railways, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson</inline> says: &#39;1 am getting $5m. I am getting free of debts to the extent of $63m. Here, take the railways. I wish 1 had never seen the slurry ducks&#39;. This is the sort of bargain that we have and Tasmania is ceasing to have any control over its railways and the associated services. </para>
          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> mentioned, in frankness no doubt, the services on the Sea road are to be associated with and dovetailed into the Tasmanian railways. That involves yielding to the policy that has been inveterately pumped out by the experts in Canberra that Tasmania has too many ports. We have 4 grand ports developed at great cost and capable of efficient and economic management. The Commonwealth operates the Interstate Commission and the Australian Shipping Commission, which trades as the Australian National Line. After the report into which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> claims to have some insight but which has not yet been made public, I suppose there will be an attempt to make 1 port serve in place of 3 northern ports to the great disadvantage of the transport system of Tasmania. </para>
          <para>So it is an evil day for Tasmania that we Liberal Tasmanian senators find ourselves in the crunch between an agreement by a Federal Labor Government, with a Tasmanian Labor Government and the Tasmanian Parliament. That is to say, the majority of Labor men in the House of Assembly, their action endorsed by the Legislative Council, with 2 reservations, have passed the Act approving of the Bill. So we find ourselves in the crunch where the Senate could not be prevailed upon to disrupt the arrangements that have been made by force of this agreement and which are to commence to operate on 1 July. But it is almost as much a mystery as the external loan raising of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> when one looks at this agreement and sees how poorly it, a contemporaneous agreement between the Commonwealth and Tasmania made at the same time as the South Australian agreement, provides for the protection of Tasmania and of any effective right on the part of her representatives to determine what lines shall be kept open and at what fares and freights the trains shall run. </para>
          <para>Whereas in the South Australian agreement there is a specific provision that when their rau ways come under Commonwealth control they wil be upgraded and improved to the standard of the other mainland States, there is no specific, undertaking with regard to Tasmanian railways in that respect. Then there is the vital question of freights. In the South Australian agreement there is the provision which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> read out during the debate on the previous BUI, which states that freight rates Will be maintained at a level that generally applies in other Commonwealth railways. There is no provision such as that in the Tasmanian agreement. In fact, it simply contains this provision: </para>
          <para>When so requested by the Senate, the Australian Minister or his delegate will consult with the State on matters regarding the operation of the existing and new railways within the State which the State considers to be of concern to the State. </para>
          <para class="block">The next clause, clause 7, states: </para>
          <para>Subject to the provisions of this clause, the Australian Commission will, if so requested by the State, continue to grant the concessional rates and concessional charges granted by the Tasmanian Commission in respect of the railways at the date of this agreement. </para>
          <para class="block">Then the nub comes. It would surprise all of us. Clause 8 states: </para>
          <para>The State will, both during and after the interim period - </para>
          <para class="block">That is to say, for all the future-  maintain its proportion of any costs existing at the date of this agreement as a contribution to such concessional rates and charges as it contributed to before the date of this agreement. </para>
          <para class="block">What is involved in the indefinite obligation of the State to continue to make contributions equal to those concessional rates? When one thinks not merely of passenger concessions but also of industry concessions which operate in that State, one finds that the Tasmanian obligation is very significant. Anybody who thinks that Tasmania will escape completely from its past losses, I am afraid, Will find that clause construed against Tasmania to its surprise and detriment in future. </para>
          <para>There is the important item of how the railways Will be maintained. I pointed out that there is no undertaking by the Commonwealth to upgrade or even maintain any specific part of the railway system of Tasmania or the system in general. All we have as a protection for the cessation of any raU service is that the matter shall be determined by arbitration. I ask: What sort of system of government is envisaged if, when there is a dispute between the Commonwealth and Tasmania as to the railway lines that shall be maintained, it is to be determined by an arbitrator? It is carefully provided in the last clause of the Agreement: </para>
          <para>The arbitrator shall not perform his functions as an arbitrator under any law relating to arbitration, but shall act as an independent expert or adjudicator. </para>
          <para class="block">Any dispute as to the closure of particular lines in the State- that is to say, whether any service shall be withdrawn from any district of Tasmania mil be left to the decision not of the Tasmanian Government, not of the Tasmanian Par.liament but of an arbitrator who is appointed. Under this Agreement, his decision operates. I say that the Tasmanian Government, in accepting an agreement such as this, has abdicated its responsibility, handed over the railway system for a pittance of $5m and has left the State people unprotected. </para>
          <para>More than that, all associated surface transport services come under the direction of the Commonwealth. They include associated road services- those services which can be associated with the railways- and probably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> &#39;s apprehension is correct and there in an intention to include within that term sea-going services. They wil be under the control of the Commonwealth for the purpose of coordinating them with the Commonwealth &#39;s idea of directing the railway services through one port, if it adheres to policy pronouncements over the last few years, and so prevent Tasmanian outer ports from being serviced independently. </para>
          <para>So the other little thing which the Tasmanian Premier no doubt thought he had some protection from- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> has referred to it and I mention it just in passing- is that there is to be one of several Commissioners appointed by Tasmania for a period of 5 years. That shows how limited and feeble is the foresight of the Tasmanian Government at the present time. Five years seems a long time for the appointment, no doubt, measuring it against the time of the next election. Contrasted with that, the Premier of the other Labor State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan,</inline> agreed to a 10-year period for his Commissioner. Each case is a feeble indication of the right of the State to be on a commission that operates what were formerly State railways that pass under Commonwealth control but which essentially served the people of the State. There is more than usual sense in integrating the system so as to get the uniform gauge in all the mainland States. It is one of the abysmal circumstances of the development of this country that we have inherited that those who pioneered the railways pioneered them on different gauges for the different States. </para>
          <para>But that consideration of impelling mainland States to come into one uniform system does not operate at all in Tasmania. My theme is that it is a most misguided agreement whereby the control of the Tasmanian system passes from the Tasmanian people&#39;s representatives into the Canberra control where, of necessity, Tasmanian affairs occupy a very small focus. In that respect the Agreement is very shortsighted. There are those in this chamber who say: &#39;But think of the $15m loss they made last year&#39;. From 1932 to 1970 the Grants Commission used to adjust Tasmania&#39;s finances so as to offset any deficit from the railways. This Agreement is due to that smart aleck trick- which it really was whereby as a result of a political imbroglio the former Premier got himself into over the tobacco tax, from which he could not extract himself except by coming to Canberra and persuading <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> that if he were to come out of the ambit of the Grants Commission <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> would adjust the former grant by $10m or $12m- I forget which it was, it may have been $15m- a year. That proved to be a most disastrous course for Tasmania. It is not irrevocable. Tasmania could go back under the Grants Commission, and if it did and got equitable treatment the financial loss that it sustains from its railways ought to be made up by the Grants Commission under the terms of its jurisdiction. So to me this represents a very material surrender of the control by the Tasmanian Parliament and the Tasmanian Government of a vital utility that has been developed for the service of the Tasmanian people. </para>
          <para>I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> in referring to the pioneering element of the railways, to the necessity to continue them at the present time for certain freights and to the prospect of their improvement if the motor car world suffers a reverse, as it may because of many circumstances. I see the surrender of the Tasmanian railway system as an abandonment of the control of a most significant utility, and any financial adversity arising from its operation could be adjusted by the Grants Commission if the present State Labor Government had sufficient fortitude, to adopt a volte-face and say: &#39;We made a blunder in going out of the Grants Commission in 1971. We want to come back to it in a manner that will permit our losses to be adjusted on a proper basis&#39;. </para>

              <para>Senator McAuliffe parroted the old expression &#39;mendicant State&#39;. The possibility of State grants was recognised in section 96 of the Constitution for the true purpose of granting financial assistance to the States in cases where it was proper, and that section has been much overlooked since then for other purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Joseph</inline> Lyons erected the Grants Commission in 1 932 and for a period of about 5 years enjoyed the unique position of being the only State to apply to the Grants Commission. Queensland went off, Queensland came back; South Australia went off, South Australia came back. It is quite obvious that if the current rate of inflation goes on there has got to be a more equable distribution of Federal finance to support State functions, of which the railway in Tasmania, an island State, is peculiarly one. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>I think that this Agreement represents a really retrograde step on the part of the Tasmanian Government. I should say that one of the things that has persuaded me that it is not a practicable proposition either to reject or to amend the Bill is that this Agreement has been through the Tasmanian Parliament and the Legislative Council there has adopted 2 amendments to the Tasmanian Act. In the first amendment it has declared that freight rates applying to the Tasmanian railways are of concern to the State and the State shall require the Australian Minister to consult with the State on all proposals to fix or vary those rates, and in any such consultations shall maintain the view that those rates shall not be fixed at a higher level than those applying to the railways of the Commonwealth outside the State. I must say that great credit is to be given to the Upper House for having secured that amendment, but it will be ineffective. The other amendment that the Legislative Council secured was that where by resolution of either House of the State Parliament it is declared that the cessation of any railway service is undesirable, the State shall, unless that resolution be rescinded, dispute the cessation of that service by the Australian National Railways Commission. That means that either House can direct the Government in regard to that matter to dispute the cessation of the service, and thereupon it becomes a matter to be referred to the Arbitrator. That again is a very weak support, but I do give credit to the Legislative Council ibr securing those 2 amendments. With those reservations, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> let the Bill pass. </para>

            <para>in reply- I think there is no need for me to respond to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> who led for the Opposition and to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> who followed him in the debate because they generally accepted that the Bill should be passed as it has been passed in the other place. Perhaps 1 should make one or two comments on what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> said. First, I refer to his challenge that the Tasmanian Government had in some way failed to carry out its responsibilities in relation to its railways. I would like to read the deficits and the forecast deficits for railway systems in the States including the Liberal States. On 30 May the Minister for Transport in New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fife,</inline> as reported in the &#39;Australian Financial Review&#39;, stated that the overall 1973-74 deficit was about $150m, the expected deficit for 1974-75 was $200m and for 1975-76 it was $250m. In Victoria the 1974 annual report on the railways showed a deficit of $86.9m. For the Queensland railways the deficit was $36m. For Western Australia the deficit was $ 16.6m. For the South Australian railways the figure was $34.6m and of course the Tasmanian railways deficit was $ 1 5m, as has been stated. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The other factor to be considered- I go straight to the point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> raised in the first place- is that after all the State of Tasmania has what could be called a run down railway system whereas the South Australian railway system, as most people know, is modern and well-established and the tracks are generally good. In Tasmania the position is the reverse; because of the terrain and narrow gauge the railways are generally run down. I do not think anyone would expect to reach the same agreement in respect of a State with a run down railway system as in respect of a State with a modern railway system. In South Australia the rehabilitation of the system by Webb in 1927 made it possible to fabricate modern rolling stock in two or three hours. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> said that it is not so important to take over a system like the Tasmanian railways, but I think it is because the general concept of manufacturing railway component parts has to be considered. It is easier to manufacture components- bogies, vehicles, automatic couplers, wheels, carriages and all the rest as if they are standardised; that alone results in great savings. </para>
          <para>In respect of the commissioners, the purpose of the Government in making the term of appointment 5 years was to do 2 things. Firstly, it wanted to tie the Tasmanian railways more closely into the national link, so it offered the Tasmanian Government a proposal to have 2 commissioners for 5 years, one on the Australian National Line and one on the Australian National Railway Commission. That would give better coordination than what obtains in South Australia where a commissioner is appointed for a period of 10 years. No doubt during that time the arrangements will be re-negotiated. </para>

              <para>He might have been. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> referred to the concessions set out in the Schedule to the BUI. I can only repeat what seems to me to be pretty clear. Coupling the Schedule, which incorporates the agreement, with what has been decided by the Government the conclusions are pretty satisfactory. The Schedule reads in paragraph 6: </para>

            <para class="block">I point out that the position in regard to the charges is not as it was put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> I am told that at present the Tasmanian Government carries the responsibility for the greater part of the concessions, not this Government. Under this proposal the Australian National Railways will take over the liability for the greater part of those concessions. The other smaller parts of the concessions will be picked up by the Tasmanian Government. Of course, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has mentioned, arbitration can be resorted to so far as closures are concerned. All in all I think that the matters raised have been satisfactorily explained. I thank the Senate for its co-operation in agreeing to the passage of the Bill. </para>

              <para>I will refer to the Aus.tralian National Railways Act. When the Australian National Railways Bill was being debated <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> raised the very point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> mentioned and the Minister for Transport agreed to insert into the Bill a prescription which was acceptable and which was reported to this place for the reasons I have given. It states: 3 1b ( I ) Without limiting the powers <inline font-style="italic">of the</inline> Commission to transport passengers and goods on the railways, the Commission may (as incidental or supplementary to, or in association with, the transport or passengers or goods on the railways) transport passengers and goods for reward by land, otherwise than on the railways . . . </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para class="block">This provision was intended to guarantee that there would not be any new incursions of the railways into the area of trade that was generally undertaken by road services. All I can say is that the provision was considered at that time to be satisfactory. </para>
            <para>As to the other point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> on clause 10, 1 think that if he reads the clause he will see that it contains the words &#39;administer, maintain and operate&#39;. Obviously a railway is not maintained if maintenance is not done. Unless there are maintenance crews, section builders, fettlers, gangers and welders it is not maintained. Clause 10 (b) mentions &#39;construct and extend railways&#39;. Maybe that is not sufficient to suit what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> thinks the Tasmanian Government might want. But so far the Tasmanian Government has raised no objection except to make a number of suggestions which were put up in the Legislative Council and which seemed to strengthen the role of the State Government. Clause 10, as I read it anyway, means that we shall continue to maintain, continue to operate and continue to construct and extend railways in Tasmania. After all, the national Government will take responsibility for them. I think it is in its own interests to see that the railways are properly maintained. As I have said, the Government wants to see a new coordinated approach. The State Government has a commissioner on the Railways Commission and on the National Line for the first time. </para>

            <para>I am grateful to the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bishop)</inline> for his explanation of the clause. Perhaps he will permit one incidental question to be repeated. Will those road services that are administered by the Commonwealth supplementary to the railways be subject to the Tasmanian road licensing system? If they are not, there may be a dislocation of them. I also rise to ask the Minister to address his attention to clause 14 of the Bill. It is the width of this clause that attracts my attention. I ask the Minister whether he will be good enough to tell me whether it is directed to any specific laws or area of other law. It states: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Agreement has effect notwithstanding anything in any other Act and nothing in any other Act prevents the carrying out or performance of any provisions of that Agreement. </para>
          <para class="block">In my limited experience of reading statute law now some 50 years- I do not recall any section so absolute or wide in its operation. I suspect comprehensive prohibitions such as that. I ask the Minister whether his knowledge of the situation would yield to me information as to whether it is directed to any specific area of law or any other specific law. </para>

            <para>I am advised that the provision does not in fact apply to any specific law but it is a general prescription which has been recommended by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> as one which is fairly uniform. I cannot identify where it is provided elsewhere but I am told that that is the reason. It is certainly not directed at any particular law. In relation to road services, I am told that it is proposed that only those road services which are presently run by the Tasmanian Government Railways will be in fact operated by the National Railways. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>I desire to raise on the adjournment a matter which I would have liked to raise in the course of some debate I have been unable to do so. It relates to the manner in which the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> has exercised the discretion accorded to him to dispense legal aid in a matter arising under the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I raise this matter because members of the Australian Labor Party who are concerned in the application for legal aid which has not been granted have been unable to obtain redress from the representations which their own Labor members have made to the Attorney-General. I am sure that these people would have preferred the matter to be raised and decided without publicity and for any difficulties to be confined within the ranks of the Australian Labor Party. But that apparently is not the case. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>A circular was distributed to the 1 975 biennial Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party by the State Secretary of the Queensland branch of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees&#39; Association. In that circular reference was made to the fact that a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barry</inline> Thomas Egan was removed from office as national secretary-treasurer of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees&#39; Association by resolution of the delegates attending the 1 974 national council meeting of the Association on Friday, 1 8 October 1974. The resolution removing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan</inline> from office, which was carried without dissent, was carried after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan</inline> had requested a period of 8 weeks in which to explain a discrepancy in excess of $120,000 in accounts filed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan</inline> in respect of the New South Wales Branch of that Association during the period he was secretary of the branch. Of the 24 delegates who voted for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan&#39;s</inline> removal from office not less than 17 were members of the Australian Labor Party. That was the statement that was circulated. As to the truth or otherwise of the allegations, I have no knowledge and I am not concerned. Suffice to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan</inline> was sufficiently concerned to take action in the Aus.tralian Industrial Court with a view to seeking redress against those members of the Association who had voted him from office. </para>
          <para>As a result of the action which he has instituted protracted court proceedings have occurred. As I understand it, court proceedings which initially commenced in November 1974 are still continuing after at least 2 1 days of actual sitting time. The legal costs which have been incurred in this court case are extremely high and the 25 officers of the Association who have been individually sued would be liable for costs which, I am told, are likely to exceed approximately $60,000. Spread amongst some 25 people it might be thought that that sum would be within the means of a number of them, but I would have thought that to the individuals who are concerned in this matter the responsibility for those costs is enormous. I remind the new Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> either in that capacity or in his capacity as Minister representing the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby),</inline> that in 1973 the provision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act with respect to costs was altered. Now in proceedings of this character no award of costs may be made against an unsuccessful party in proceedings before the Industrial Court. So it is quite clear that the persons who have been sued in those proceedings, irrespective of the result of the proceedings, have a liability for those costs. They have had a liability for those costs from the very day on which they were joined as parties to the proceedings. </para>
          <para>I mention that because I think it is a highly significant fact in the difficulties which they are experiencing and which they have not been able to have resolved even by the merest assurance that their costs would be met by the Attorney-General. As I have indicated the proceedings started on 1 November 1974. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan</inline> applied for financial assistance, as he is entitled to do, under section 141 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act I am informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Enderby</inline> as Attorney-General approved his application for financial assistance in March or April 1975. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan&#39;s</inline> then wage, with allowances, was some $320 weekly. I mention that only because it is a sum vastly in excess of the amounts which are being earned and received by the persons whom he is suing. </para>
          <para>I understand that individual applications for assistance- not a block application- were made by the people who were being sued over a period from December until the last of the 25 people applied in February 1975. 1 understand that the applications were accompanied by statutory declarations. I quote one paragraph of the general form of statutory declaration which I understand has been lodged: </para>
          <para>I am informed by my solicitor and believe that the said proceedings are expected to occupy at least six days of hearing and will commence in the Australian Industrial Court in Sydney on or about 25 February 1974. 1 say that my take-home pay does not exceed- </para>
          <para class="block">Then there is set out whatever is the appropriate amount with regard to each individual case. </para>

              <para>I do not know. It is simply a document which the honourable senator can certainly look at if he wants to do so. I do not mind. It is a facsimile, a background document. The letter continues: </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>I say that my take-home pay does not exceed $ . . . per week and I have no assets other than those of a domestic nature sufficient to enable me to meet the costs and expenses of defending the said proceedings without hardship to myself. </para>
            <para class="block">The request was for the Attorney-General to approve payment of reasonable legal costs and expenses pursuant to section 14 In of the Act. The solicitor for the respondents wrote to the Secretary of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department on 25 February, referring to his earlier letters of 12, 16, 17 and 19 December 1974 and 21 and 22 January 1975, and asked that the Attorney-General&#39;s direction be sought as soon as departmental convenience permitted. Subsequent follow-up letters were forwarded but to this day there has been no indication by the Attorney-General as to whether those expenses would be met. </para>
            <para>I imagine that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland will not be in a position to answer these questions tonight, although if he is able to give some indication I am sure it will be appreciated. My purpose in airing this matter is to indicate that an injustice is being caused and that it ought to be rectified. There appears to me to be no reason why it should not be rectified unless the apprehension that is held by these respondents is a justified apprehension; that is, that the Attorney-General has been prevailed upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan</inline> and his associate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Paul</inline> Russell Whelan who, I understand, is an associate of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Enderby,</inline> to ensure that whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan</inline> has his financial expenses guaranteed to him, the fact that the respondents have no guarantee whatever that their costs will be paid will place them in an invidious position and they will not continue in the proceedings and thereby allow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan</inline> to succeed in his application. Whether that be right or wrong I am unable to say, but it is an apprehension which is felt by the respondents. </para>
            <para>When one takes into account the number of applicants- and I understand that the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bishop)</inline> is one of the persons who made application to the Attorney-General on behalf of these people and that the Executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions has been concerned to make representations on behalf of these people- unless some action is taken the purposes of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provision which enable legal aid to be paid will not be satisfied. The provision in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act has a heightened impact because of the fact that no costs can now be awarded in this type of proceeding against the other party, and everybody who is engaged in that litigation knows from the moment that litigation commences there will be liability for costs that they will have to bear, and in this case it is a significant liability. </para>
            <para>I therefore pose these questions: Has the Attorney-General had for his consideration since February 1975 applications for financial assistance from some 25 members of Australia&#39;s third largest trade union in respect of a legal proceeding taken against those officers by one Barry Thomas Egan in the Industrial Court? Was the Attorney-General requested by any person to expedite approval for financial assistance to Barry Thomas Egan and to delay or deny approval for financial assistance to those against whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan</inline> was bringing proceedings in order to force those persons to abandon their opposition to the orders sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan?</inline> In consequence of that request did the Attorney-General in or about April 1975 approve payment of financial assistance to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan?</inline></para>
            <para>Further, in or about that month, did the Attorney-General request his departmental officers to withdraw a recommendation that financial assistance be extended for the 25 respondents who opposed the order sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan</inline> and substitute for that recommendation an advice which conveyed that the Attorney-General could with propriety delay his decision on the respondents&#39; application until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan&#39;s</inline> action against time had run its course? If this is so, will the Attorney-General identify the person who requested him to adopt this course and table all the adv i sings from his departmental officers in connection with this matter between January and June 1 975. </para>
            <para>I finally ask: Is the Attorney-General aware that the amendments made to this legislation in 1972 under which the Attorney-General was given the power and the authority to determine applications for financial assistance were made so that the Parliament could satisfy itself that the exercise of this important discretion would be characterised by justice and efficiency rather than by the possible partisanship and the possible inefficiency which could exist if officers over whom the Parliament had no authority were handling this matter? </para>
            <para>In view of the circumstances I simply say that where a Minister has the responsibility in these areas a House of the Parliament is an appropriate place where his handling of this discretion could be raised. I trust that I have raised this matter in a manner which highlights the problems of principle which are involved in the way in which this discretion is exercised. I indicate that this is not a case in which the broad Party political issues are canvassed but the matter is being aired to ensure that there is proper administration of our legal aid scheme. This is a case where I think an injustice has been carried on for far too long. I would be grateful is the Minister representing the Attorney-General could see as quickly as possible that justice is done. </para>

            <para>I suppose we can give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> credit for acting tonight in a spirit of high principle, but I think we can be excused for feeling some scepticism that that was his real motivation. He did not make any direct accusations against the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby),</inline> but there were some snide innuendoes in what he&#39; said. For instance, he said that an application for legal aid had been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan,</inline> and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whalan</inline> who he understood was an associate of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Enderby.</inline> I would like a more precise definition of that statement from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> The Attorney-General of Australia does not have an associate in the sense that a judge has an associate. What does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> mean b suggesting that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whalan</inline> is an associate of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Enderby?</inline> Is this meant to indicate that he is in a position to bring some undue influence on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Enderby?</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As I understand the gravamen of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> speech, it was that the Attorney-General had exercised his discretion to grant legal aid in a &#39;manner which favoured certain litigants in an individual litigation and which wrongfully brought pressure on the opponents of his favoured side in this industrial litigation by keeping them in doubt as to whether they would be up for extensive costs in the proceedings that are on foot. He does not have any proof of that. But, even though he does not have any proof and even though he has put the whole matter as a sort of tentative questions and as a seeking of enlightenment as to whether the suspected injustice is in fact the case, he has not hesitated to assert positively that an injustice is being done. I suggest that this is legal sharp practice at its worst. </para>
          <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline>does not have any facts upon which to base the innuendo that he has cast into the ring here tonight. All he knows is that legal aid has been granted to one side in litigation and that apparently it has not yet been granted to the other side. I am not aware- I could not be expected to be aware- of the precise facts of this situation. But my recollection of the legislation providing for legal aid in the industrial law of this country is that the respondents that is, the parties who are dragged into the ring, who did not start the proceedings- in litigation may make application for payment of their costs. My experience when I was practising in this arena was that they were very rarely refused. </para>
          <para>To make a charge that the Attorney-General of Australia is using his power to exercise a discretion for the granting of costs in favour of one side in the litigation and is withholding the granting of costs to the other side in order to favour one side and to intimidate the other side is, I should have thought, a charge of such seriousness that the man making the charge would have had precise information on which to make it. But nothing emerged from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> said to indicate that he has any such proof. That did not stop him from bandying around words like &#39;injustice&#39;. I would suggest- I confess that I do not know the facts of this matter that to bandy the matter around in this way is the height of irresponsibility. </para>
          <para>I hasten to add that I do not even know the merits of the litigation between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan</inline> and his opponents. I have not taken sides, politically or industrially, in the matter. But I think that we have to admit that for the state to pay the costs in litigation between rival factions in unions is a reasonable social cost and that if we are to preserve democracy in the unions- where after all large interests inevitably come into conflict- it must be accepted that the costs that individual unionists or even officials of unions incur in the deciding of these matters in the courts are appropriate for the state to bear. This is especially the case because of the particularly tangled state of industrial law in this country. I do not want to be embarking once more upon a journey into the thickets of the Moore v. Doyle case, but the fact of the matter is that, with the best will in the world, union members in this country can find themselves involved in litigation caused primarily by the dichotomy between State and Federal industrial law and, in defence of what they consider to be highly cherished rights, they may have to embark upon the most tangled, lengthy litigation the cost of which they should not be asked to bear. </para>

              <para>That is a side issue in the matter that we are discussing tonight. Where the battles are fought out, whether in a superior court or an industrial court, is not really germane to the issue I am discussing. If we want to have unions and union leaderships in this country that genuinely reflect the wishes of their members, which I suggest is a highly important social matter, I think that it is appropriate that, with the right safeguards, the state- I do not mean, say, New South Wales; I mean the &#39;state&#39; in its generic sense; the government, if you like; the people- should bear the cost of the litigation which decides in the ultimate analysis who are the legitimate leaders of these vast and powerful organisations. To suggest that the Attorney-General, who has an unblemished record so far as any person in this Parliament knows- I have never heard anyone suggest otherwise- should use this highly important power to favour one faction against another is, I suggest, a grave and very unworthy charge in the absence of positive evidence. In any event I will take great pains to find out what are the facts of this matter and I will seek an appropriate occasion to set them out. </para>

            <para>I wish to speak on the same matter, because my name has been mentioned. Perhaps I should state for the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland and others what the position was. About a fortnight ago I was approached by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Goldsworthy,</inline> the General Secretary of the Shop Assistants Union. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Goldsworthy,</inline> who is a South Australian, advised me that he and the Australian Council of Trade Unions had made representations to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Enderby</inline> about the matter. He asked whether I would speak to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Enderby</inline> about it. I did so within a couple of days. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Enderby</inline> stated that he had not determined the matter and that it would be considered at a later date. I related that answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Goldsworthy.</inline> I was told that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Goldsworthy</inline> would take a deputation to the Minister. I am not aware of what has developed since then. But the matter was put to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Enderby</inline> who said that the matter was under consideration and that it had not been determined. I understood then that either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Goldsworthy</inline> or the ACTU would follow up the matter. </para>

            <para>I rise tonight to speak on matters of a domestic nature. I do so mindful of the statement that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> made during the adjournment debate last Wednesday. You said: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I hope that there will never be another occasion when these matters have to be raised in the adjournment debate in the Senate. </para>
          <para class="block">Unfortunately, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> because of developments over the past few days it is necessary for these matters to be raised again. I refer, firstly, to an advertisement which appeared in the &#39;Canberra Times&#39; on Saturday 7 June. One can only assume that the advertisement was placed as a result of what was said during the adjournment debate last Wednesday. The advertisement is very brief and I would like to read it to the Senate. It appears under the Australian coat of arms and it simply states: </para>
          <para>AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT JOINT HOUSE DEPARTMENT </para>
          <para class="block">ATTENDANT GRADE 1 </para>
          <para class="block">(Position more suited to females) </para>
          <para>SALARY: $6,358-6,663 per annum. Superannuation available after qualifying period. </para>
          <para>DUTIES: Assist members of the Public, particularly females, visiting Parliament House. Staff and Information Centre, and Bookshop. Weekend work involved. </para>
          <para>QUALIFICATIONS: Neat pleasant appearance essential and an aptitude for or expedience in dealing with the public desirable. </para>
          <para class="block">One can only assume that the word &#39;expedience&#39; was supposed to be the word &#39;experience&#39;, unless, of course, the Joint House Department does find it necessary to get rid of visitors virtually as they come through the front door by disposing of them out the back door. </para>
          <para>I have never claimed to be an academic. I am a pretty simple sort of a person, but I would really like someone to clarify for me what that advertisement is all about. I cannot understand that a responsible department of the Parliament of </para>
          <para class="block">Australia not only could but would insert such drivel in a daily newspaper. I would like to know, for instance, to whom I am supposed to apply; how I am supposed to apply, whether by writing, by telephone, or perhaps it is thought that we still use carrier pigeons. I would also like to make sure, if I were an applicant, that I knew by what date my application was due in. I would like to have some indication as to when an appointment would be made. In addition as an applicant I would like to know- as a senator I would certainly Uke to know- just what the term &#39;superannuation available after qualifying period&#39; actually means. I ask this question mainly because, as I pointed out last Wednesday, we have only one female attendant, who is still employed in a temporary capacity even though she was appointed in 1973. </para>
          <para>I would Uke to read from a letter dated 9 June 1975, which was yesterday, received by that attendant. I do so in an endeavour to have the situation clarified. The information I am about to give to the Senate did not come from the attendant herself. I am given to understand that already a form of intimidation is being used against her. So, in order to provide her with some form of protection, I intend not only to read the letter but also to name the person concerned. The letter is addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs M.</inline> Rodda, Joint House Department, Parliament House, Canberra. As I said, the letter is dated 9 June. It reads: </para>
          <para>I refer to your enquiry of 9 June, 1975, concerning your position of Attendant, Grade 1, on the staff of this Department. </para>
          <para>You may be assured that the rights and entitlements you have in your present position are being kept in mind and will not be prejudiced when the new appointment to the vacancy recently advertised, is made. It is, in fact, to protect your position that the new appointment will be made in a temporary capacity only, at least in the first instance. </para>
          <para class="block">
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>would someone please explain to me how superannuation benefits could possibly be available if the appointment is being made &#39;in a temporary capacity only &#34;? The letter goes on: </para>
          <para>However, just as we are protecting your interests against new appointees, you will appreciate that it is also necessary to protect the interests of other Attendants, Grade 1, with longer service than yourself. It is for this reason that your appointment has been delayed so that the necessary formalities can be completed that will allow these Attendants to be appointed with not less seniority status than yourself. It is regretted that this action has taken longer than expected, but I am hopeful that finality in it will be reached within the next few weeks. </para>
          <para class="block">The letter is signed &#39;R. W. Hillyer, Secretary&#39;. I pointed out that the attendant has been employed by the Joint House Department since some time in the middle of 1973 and all she is getting at the moment is a regretful notice from the Secretary of the Department saying &#39;that this action has taken longer than expected&#39;. I understood that most Public Service awards provided for appointment to the permanent staff after 6 months&#39; service, and I am rather curious as to why that has not already been done. </para>
          <para>I would like now to quote from a letter referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> in the adjournment debate this week. It is a letter also written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hillyer</inline> and is dated 6 May, which is already one month away. I read from the Hansard record: </para>
          <para>The staff ceiling limit that was imposed was later eased and accordingly some months ago one of the two women remaining, who was previously on part-time only, was advised that she would be appointed permanently to the vacant full-time position. However, she was also informed that, so as not to place her in a more favourable seniority position than the other Attendants who had given longer service, her appointment would not take place until administrative action could be taken that would allow these other Attendants to also be made permanent officers. This action is now in hand and it is anticipated that the permanent appointment of this female Attendant will soon be possible which will then also make it possible for an appointment to be made to the position she will vacate. </para>
          <para class="block">I read into that advertisement that a number of attendant staff around this Parliament House are also on virtually temporary employment. It does not matter that they may have been employed here for some years. </para>
          <para>I return to the advertisement, or perhaps I could call it the non-advertisement, which was placed in the &#39;Canberra Times&#39;. The final paragraph deals with superannuation benefits being available. I am extremely curious about this reference. At the time I spoke on this matter last week I did not have any figures available. I have done a little homework since then and I have found that approximately 26 000 people visit Parliament House in each 12 monthly period. This is 26 000 people who actually take part in the guided tour. This figure does not take into consideration the number who come in when the Houses are sitting. It is quite possible that if those people were taken into consideration and registered as entering the building, the number of visitors could be trebled even. I understand that on public holidays and during holiday periods there are frequently 2000 to 3000 visitors a day to this building. Yet we still have only 2 female members of the attendant staff, although an appointment was approved by the Joint House Committee some weeks ago. </para>
          <para>I think that concern should be expressed also that during weekends there are only 5 members of the staff available at Parliament House. Three of these people act as guides, one is in attendance at the front door and the other one is a female attendant who, by then, is doing her mind bending little bit in the cage downstairs. It is supposed to be a book selling department. If honourable senators have not been inside it, I suggest that if they really want to blow their brains they spend a couple of hours tied up there. Those 5 people have to be responsible not only for the security the tours, the inquiries and the book sales conducted in the House on those days but also they have to appear to be charming and look as if they really are enjoying their lives. </para>
          <para>I do not think I am being presumptuous in suggesting that the Joint House Department should perhaps make available to itself fairly soon the services of a person with a little knowledge of copywriting of advertisements and perhaps it should be instructed- not requested but instructed to place another advertisement in the &#39;Canberra Times&#39; as soon as possible, complete with all the details, pointing out that this will be a temporary appointment only. If the Joint House Department were really serious in not trying to get anyone to apply for the position advertised, the advertisement placed in the newspaper was a darned good start. I am also presumptuous enough to suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Rodda</inline> should look forward to becoming a permanent member of the staff and to receive as early as possible the superannuation benefits mentioned in the advertisement. </para>
          <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>I, like yourself, am anxious that this adjournment debate should be utilised in the way it was intended and not in the main for airing matters of domesticity. But a number of problems relating to this debate have been brought to my attention. It is rather amazing how people are made aware that perhaps you intend doing something for them. I wish to quote from the Hansard record of the Senate Estimates Committee A which met on Monday, 22 October 1973. The evidence on pages 335 and 336 deals with the situation with regard to additional attendant staff having been employed and there is some discussion between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland who was  chairman  of the Committee, the then  President  of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack, and Senators Wright and Georges, together with the  Clerk  of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Odgers,</inline> and the Usher of the Black Rod, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith.</inline> As reported on page 335, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> raised this question: </para>
          <para>But do I understand that an attendant has to work a considerable time before he goes on to an overtime rating? </para>
          <para class="block">
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith</inline>replied: </para>
          <para>The Public Service (Parliamentary Officers) Regulations lay down hours of duty based on a conceptual 36 and three quarter hour week, which is the normal Public Service working week. </para>
          <para class="block">
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>I understand that there are still a number of attendants on the staff who find it necessary to work a 40-hour week before they actually go on to any overtime. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith</inline> says- I remind the Senate that this was on 22 October 1973- in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator George&#39;s</inline> further question: </para>
          <para>Is that for everyone? </para>
          <para>Well, for everyone on the Senate staff. It does not necessarily apply to all other departments because other departments have different kinds of positions. I understand that the Joint House Department has different hours for people working in its refreshment <inline font-style="italic">rooms</inline> and other areas. But it is based on a conceptual 36% hour week which involves- I may be wrong here, because these hours have changed recently- working 3214 hours in recess and 42 hours in session. From time to time, we have taken out a study on this matter to see whether the conceptual 36% hour week has been exceeded or whether it has been in the attendants&#39; favour. We have never yet found it to be not in the attendants&#39; favour. </para>
          <para class="block">I have a great deal of correspondence on this and I do not intend reading it all but there are extracts which I would like to have written into the record. I put to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that if there are still discrepancies we have been falling down on this job since 22 October 1973 when an Estimates Committee was assured that the situation did not exist. For instance back on 15 February 1973-1 have read all this correspondence but I do not intend reading it to the Senate- a similar question was raised by the Branch Secretary of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers&#39; Union. He made representations to the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives who was then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr W.</inline> J. Aston, and to the  President  of the Senate who was then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack. It is from this last letter that I quote. It is dated 15 February 1973: </para>
          <para>The representations you have made have been the subject of examination by the officers of the parliamentary departments concerned and of discussion with officers of the Public Service Board. However, there remain certain details that still need to be settled and I have asked those concerned to expedite their consideration of these so that a reply to you can be furnished as soon as possible. </para>
          <para class="block">I do not know whether in actual fact <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wood</inline> ever received a reply. I am not even sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack got any further with the matter, but I know that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> on 8 May 1973 in your capacity as Government Whip in the Senate received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hillyer,</inline> the Secretary of the Joint House Department, which said: </para>

          <para>As previously advised the Federated Miscellaneous Workers&#39; Union submission on this matter is still under consideration and I am not in a position at this point of time to indicate either agreement to the proposal or rejection of it. </para>
          <para class="block">However, I am conscious of the need to secure an early decision and you may be assured every endeavour will be made to provide one as soon as possible. </para>

While we are speaking of the male attendants let us look at the same letter by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hillyer,</inline> dated 6 May, which relates to the shirt and footwear allowances for the Senate staff attendants. It states: </para>

          <para>Footwear- One pair of shoes per annum to the value of $8.75 or, if preferred, one pair each two years at a cost of 17.50. </para>
          <para class="block">Two questions come to my mind. Firstly, from where did the figure of $5 per shirt come? Secondly, who contrived the figure of $8.75 a year for a pair of shoes? </para>

              <para>Yes, it probably was. But even in 1973 where would attendants have been able to buy the articles at those prices? We are talking about the tools of trade of the male attendants at Parliament House. We are talking about those tools of trade in exactly the same way as the tools of trade of a plumber, a bricklayer or a carpenter are referred to in union disputes and union awards. There must have been some basis for somebody coming down with those rather brilliant figures. I should like to clarify the situation to find out from where the figures came. The attendants should perhaps be a little thankful that the Taxation Department has a more realistic attitude to the prices paid for clothing which is being used as uniform. I think one would find that attendants are allowed a little more leeway in their taxation returns. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>I would Uke to make a couple more points. One of the most controversial areas in the running of the House, as far as I am concerned, is the situation which exists in the dining rooms where we are subjected to a rather repetitious menu which changes very little and which does not depend at all on climatic conditions or the days of sitting. But at least with our facilities we are able to order and receive a number of items of food at rather peculiar hours- but then we work rather peculiar hours. Unfortunately the situation is not the same in the staff dining room. I understand that it is not even possible to purchase a slice of toast there after about 9.30 in the morning. I understand that the premises are rather touchingly referred to as &#39;Hepatitis Hall&#39;. </para>
            <para>I notice that on 25 May 1973 in the report of the proceedings of Estimates Committee A there was a rather humorous interchange between Senators Wheeldon, Gair, Georges and McLaren on this very item. So perhaps we should be looking for a more comprehensive study of the running of the dining rooms while we are having this airing and general complaint about the administration of the Joint House Department. I have noticed in my arrivals and departures at and from Parliament House a number of parking signs clearly marked &#39;Members Only&#39;. One could assume from that that a number of members drive to Parliament each day and require close proximity parking. But the real situation is not as simple as that. In actual fact the parking is not even for the personal staff of members or for some of the most important people in this House- the Hansard reporters. I had a quick look around today and I discovered that most of the parking facilities marked for members only were being used by members of the Joint House Department, the clerks of the Senate and numerous other people, but with a couple of members thrown in for good luck. </para>

              <para>I think it is about time members themselves did something about it. I understand that the difficulty in obtaining car parking stickers is exceeded only by the difficulty in drawing hens&#39; teeth. The staff of members, Hansard writers, the typists, the librarians and, one presumes, the switchboard operators, the dining room attendants, the bar staff and others have to park their cars up at the back of the House. If one looks at it in the dark at night or in the early hours of the morning one realises that it might as well be at the back of Bourke. It is in a dark area with great potential, for instance, for rapists. I understand that on Friday night of last week Canberra residents were warned that a rapist had escaped. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>The people on whom we rely to do so much work- and the female staff particularly- in our involvement here in Parliament House are required to walk into a reasonably secluded, dimly lit area to collect their cars at night. A number of them have already found that their tyres have been let down. They have left this House in the late hours of the night or the early hours of the morning and have found themselves in some difficulty in trying to get home. I am not affected because I do not have a car in Canberra, but a lot of other people are affected. We should not wait until there is a rape or an attempted rape, until there is an attack or an attempted attack, before some action is taken. I am a great believer in prevention being better than the cure. So let us start doing some preventing. </para>
            <para>I understand that last year a study was carried out of the close proximity car parking facilities for the people who work in the House, and it was determined by that study that no further facilities were necessary for them. Of course, the fact that the study was undertaken in broad daylight would not have thrown a great deal of light on the matter. Perhaps we should have someone out there having a look at the situation in the dark of night when these people are required to leave. There is a pressing need for a better lit parking area for those people who have to work because of our involvement and their involvement here. </para>
            <para>Having mentioned pressing needs, I should like to draw the attention of the Senate to a situation which would probably be quite amusing except that it is so ridiculous. Honourable senators are probably aware that in the main part of the building outside the chamber there is a ladies toilet at the back of the Senate attendants box, just up the stairs inside the front entrance. It is quite clearly marked &#39;Ladies Convenience&#39; I think and it is presumed that this convenience is there for the use of ladies who come to visit Parliament House- the very ladies who are mentioned in the advertisement. Some 2 weeks ago I understand they started - </para>

              <para>Well, they are not terribly interested in the running of the House anyway. But for about 2 weeks now I have been conscious of an almost constant stream of people being directed downstairs and I have discovered that these toilets are having the ceilings replaced. While the House is sitting, if you do not mind, with a rather lengthy recess coming up, they are having the ceilings replaced in the ladies&#39; toilets which are required for the use of the general public. The difficulty arises, I believe, in that yesterday the downstairs facilities were being painted and are still being painted and therefore are closed to the public. </para>

              <para>I am pleased. At least he is expressing some concern. I presume the Joint House Department ordered firstly the replacement of the ceilings in the original toilets and now it has ordered that the toilets downstairs, normally for the use of lady visitors to the House, are to be painted. To the best of my knowledge, the only other facilities downstairs are those that require people to go through a door which has a sign outside which clearly states &#39;Members only allowed through these doors&#39;. Quite frankly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I dread to think of the number of women who must stand there almost with their legs crossed and quivering wondering whether they dare go through those doors. I believe that it should have been possible for all of these things to have been arranged during the recess and I am concerned that obviously the Joint House Department did not take that into consideration. Of course, if it had been done then, it would not really have inconvenienced anyone a great deal. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>I must admit, I find it a little disconcerting to have to traverse something like 4 corridors to get from this chamber to a ladies&#39; toilet. Yet immediately behind your entrance, where you are sitting now, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> there are 2 toilet facilities; one is marked &#39;Senators&#39;- and I am a senator- and the other is marked &#39;Officials&#39; and one can only presume in this illustrious House that they are both intended for males. I question the right of any male official to have a toilet in such close proximity to this chamber as against the right of female members of this House. I cannot understand that someone at some time has not thought of simply making one a male toilet and the other a female toilet but now that I have put the idea into their heads perhaps someone will give the matter some consideration. This toilet could be used by the female members of the staffs of the members of Parliament. It could even be used by female members of Parliament. </para>

            <para>In conclusion I simply want to refer to a reply to a question on notice which was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren.</inline> I am aware that the hour is late and that members want to get to their respective abodes in preparation for a reasonably long day tomorrow. I question the reply that has been provided to question No. 549 in that it contains no reference to any of the employees in the bars or the dining rooms. Yet I am quite sure that a number of those employees would be considered to be administrative staff. The reply lists the names of 13 people on salaries ranging from $6,000-odd to $20,000. The reply is supposed to relate to the administrative staff of the Joint House Department. I respectfully suggest that perhaps this question should be returned to the Joint House Department, through the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt),</inline> for clarification and that the Senate should decide now that there be a comprehensive study into the running of the House at present by the Joint House Department. That would appear to me to be the only way to avoid having to speak continually during adjournment debates about matters on which senators require clarification. </para>

            <para>It is my desire to raise also a matter related to the Joint House Department. At the time I put my name down on the list to speak tonight I was not aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> intended to refer to the answer given to me today. I intend to refer to it. It relates to question No. 529 which I placed on the notice paper on 14 May. It sought information as to the numerical strength of the administrative staff of the Joint House Department, the duties performed by each person and the salaries paid. The answer reveals a strength of thirteen. Names, in order of seniority, are supplied. In respect of the Chief Executive Officer it is not stated whether the position is permanent or temporary, yet every other officer is designated as a temporary employee or a permanent employee. The duties of all the staff, except the Secretary who is in receipt of a salary of $20,000 per annum, have been outlined. I am particularly interested to know why these particulars were omitted from the answer. I would be grateful if they could be supplied at an early date. The total salary paid to all 13 staff at a minimum rate is in excess of $124,000 per annum. If the maximum rate is applied the amount is in excess of $132,000. </para>

              <para>I am coming to that. These figures are arrived at without any allowance for overtime. Therefore it will be seen that an astronomical cost is involved in the administration of the Joint House Department. One wonders why that should be so. Paragraph (6) of the answer given to me today explains why. I will quote that paragraph. It states: </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>Up to the year 1954 the functions of Secretary to the Joint House Department were carried out by a senior officer of either the Senate or the House of Representatives in addition to the duties of his substantive office. In 1954 with the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> H. C. Loof, then  Clerk  Assistant of the Senate and Secretary, Joint House Department, the  President  of the Senate and  Speaker  of the House of Representatives decided that the growth in the functions of both positions made it essential to separate them and so the office of Secretary to the Joint House Department was created and filled in a full time capacity. The numerical strength of the administrative section of the Department at that time was eight. </para>
            <para class="block">That was in 1954. Of course we are now told that the size of the staff has grown to thirteen. </para>
            <para>The number of staff referred to previously and costs involved have to be considerably added to because there are other people who are employed in connection with the running of the services of the Parliament- the catering and bar services, etc.- who have to do a great deal of administrative and clerical work, who are charged with certain responsibilities, and who are on a lower rate of salary than some of the administrative staff whose only duty, it would appear, according to the duty statements provided, is in double checking the work of the people in the category I have just mentioned. I refer to the people who work in the bar, the cellar and other associated jobs. </para>
            <para>I understand that it has not been the practice in the past for committees such as the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Accounts to inquire into departments of the Parliament due to the fact that the committees have been reluctant to do so. However, in view of the enormous cost of administering the Joint House Department, as has been revealed here today, it would appear that the time is now appropriate for the Public Accounts Committee to make a searching inquiry into the affairs of the Department in order to ascertain if its continued existence in its present form is necessary. I seek leave to table the duty statements which were provided to me today by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt),</inline> since I was told that they were too cumbersome to incorporate in Hansard. They are all set out here, the exact copy of which was provided by the Leader of the Government. I seek leave to table these documents for the information of honourable senators. </para>

It reminded me of what happened to me last week on the way to this forum. I was caught- and I am serious about this- in the toilet, and the bells began to ring. I do not know whether any other honourable senator has been caught in this situation. It was a most unnerving experience, and I certainly do not know how our lady senators would fare in similar circumstances. Perhaps it is not commonly known that one cannot see the bell lights from the toilet. What happens in those circumstances is hard to describe, but perhaps the word &#39;panic&#39; could be used. Since we are talking of matters domestic I have a suggestion to make. </para>

              <para>No,I suggest that the bell lights be placed in such a way that they can be seen from the toilets. At least one would then know that the green lights were showing and not the red ones. Or we could use a device which has been made available to Ministers in this placetrie telephone. I suggest seriously that not only should the bell lights be placed in sight of the toilets but that a telephone should be placed in each cubicle so that an honourable senator so placed could make arrangements for a quick pair. A direct line into the Whip&#39;s office would answer the purpose. I am suggesting, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that you take this matter up with the Secretary of the Joint House Department, who has come under some considerable criticism during the adjournment debate tonight, to see whether or not this improvement could be made, especially in senators&#39; toilets- both male and female. </para>

I can say that the Joint House Department is seeking more staff to facilitate rostering for work on the information desks, and I think that this was the reason for the advertisements that have been referred to. It is the intention to man the information desk from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. on sitting days and to 5 p.m. on non sitting days for 7 days a week. Arrangements are under way to employ extra staff for the book stall to overcome the difficulty there. That is all the information that I can give to the Senate at the moment. </para>

            <para>1 ) In 1972 complaints received by the Department from residents about indiscriminate use of trail-bikes near houses prompted the search for areas where trail-bikes could be accommodated without disturbance to residents. Management of forest recreation also required separation of trail bikes from some other incompatible recreational activities. </para>

        <para>The Department conducted an assessment of forests to locate areas suitable for use by trail-bikes. The selection criteria were: approximately 100 to I SO hectares in area; well-buffered from houses to prevent noise nuisance; quickly and easily accessible from city areas; a range of topography from gentle to steep and rough to cater for beginners and experienced riders; a surface likely to be able to stand the impact of trail-bike disturbance. </para>

            <para>The Department&#39;s view is that the prime values of this rough, remote area are achieved by present arrangements. The Department provides public general access to some 10 000 hectares of plantation and 30 000 hectares of native forest. The zoning of sections of the forest is considered essential for maximum safe use of the forest for the greater range of activities. Exclusion of users other than trail-bikes from the 120 hectares assists in avoiding conflicting use of the remaining 2000 hectares of Mt Stromlo forest and in the other natural areas around the city. It is estimated that 10 000 user visits were made to the area in 1974. The Department will continue to monitor the area which has created strong interest as a recreational facility throughout Australia. </para>

        <para>Is it a fact, as reported in a section of today&#39;s press, that the Australian Government did not send aircraft to Vietnam for humanitarian relief purposes recently until after a request was made by the United States Secretary of State, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kissinger?</inline></para>
        <para class="block">The answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>On 29 March the United States Charge called on the Department of Foreign Affairs and requested assistance from the Government of Australia for what was hoped to be a multi-national effort to uplift a large number of refugees from the war zone around Danang. In readily responding to this request the Government noted its humanitarian aim and that it had the support of the Government of the Republic of Vietnam. Immediately RAAF aircraft at Butterworth were placed on standby and six CI30&#39;s left Australia within 8 hours of the request. </para>
          <para>Of course, humanitarian assistance to Indo-China had been made available previously through international agencies and, on this and earlier occasions, Australia&#39;s response to the vast human problems created by the fighting in Vietnam was equally prompt and generous. The aircraft were not able to be used at Danang but remained in the area and fulfilled a wide variety of humanitarian tasks. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>The Minister will recollect that some weeks ago he informed the Senate of the movement of the gentlemen from Cairo representing the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Arab League. My question is in three parts. I ask: Firstly, are those gentlemen travelling on diplomatic passports? Secondly, if they are travelling on diplomatic passports, who issued those diplomatic passports? Thirdly, if those gentlemen are travelling on diplomatic passports is that not a breach of the Vienna Convention. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>In my answer to the honourable senator, I took it that his question related to the visit by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr El</inline> Surani. I said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr El</inline> Surani was scheduled to arrive in Australia in early June, that he was first visiting India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, that the visit did not involve Government sponsorship and that the Government had received no indication whether the PLO or other organisations would request visas for further visits to Australia. My understanding at the time was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr El</inline> Surani was not travelling on a diplomatic passport. </para>
        <para>The following additional information is provided in answer to the three parts of the senator&#39;s question: </para>
        <list type="lowerroman">
          <item label="(i)">
            <para>and (ii) According to information now available from the Australian Embassy in Cairo, senior members of the Arab League Secretariat are normally issued with diplomatic passports by the country in which they reside. Consistent with this policy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr El</inline> Surani is travelling on an Egyptian diplomatic passport which describes him as a representative of the Arab League. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(iii)">
            <para>This is not in breach of the Vienna Convention. According to the Convention, and the rules of international practice, a country is not precluded from issuing a passport, diplomatic or otherwise to anyone it chooses. These passports normally confer diplomatic rights and privileges on holders accredited to a particular country. Since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr El</inline> Surani is not an accredited Egyptian diplomatic representative to Australia, and is coming on a private visit, no such rights or privileges will accrue to him here. </para>
