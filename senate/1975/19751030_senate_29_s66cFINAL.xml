Does the Treasurer regularly supply figures showing the expended and unexpended percentages of supply money granted by Parliament for the 5 months from July to November?

It gives an opportunity to a number of people, particularly migrants, to obtain information about the social services available to them in a more convenient way than was available previously. </para>

            <para>-I am afraid that the situation in the Lebanon is no better, if it is not worse. Our Embassy in Beirut is now suggesting to Australian citizens in Lebanon who seek the Embassy&#39;s advice that they should consider leaving Beirut unless they have overriding reasons for remaining. If the fighting in Beirut gets much worse the Embassy may have to make a more general recommendation. I hope that Australian citizens in Lebanon will heed the Embassy&#39;s advice. While the Embassy will do what it can to assist Australian citizens in whatever circumstances may develop- we have been looking at possible arrangements for some time- it is clearly better for Australians to make their own plans in good time and while circumstances allow. </para>

          <para>I deeply regret the developments which have made this kind of planning necessary. For a long time Lebanon has fulfilled a role in the Middle East which has been of value and importance to the rest of the world. In Australia we have come to value the strong links which have been forged between the Lebanese and Australian peoples. I am sure that all Australians will share my hope and that of the Australian Government that the fighting will be soon ended and a democratic Lebanese state will again be at peace and able to make its unique contributions to the world. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. On 10 September 1975 the Minister was asked whether it was true that the Director of the Hospital Contributions Fund of Australia in New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner,</inline> and the General Manager of the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd in New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cade,</inline> had recently had salary increases raising their annual earnings from $31,000 to $50,000. The Minister was further asked whether he would present the Senate with a rundown of the salaries and allowances of officials of all or any of the major health insurance funds. Has the Minister been able to obtain the information from the funds? </para>

            <para>-As a result of that question I asked the Director-General of Social Security to try to obtain that information. He wrote to the various hospital and medical benefit funds on 10 September seeking that information. Three funds replied declining to give the information. They were the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia in New South Wales, the Hospital Contributions Fund of New South Wales and the Mutual Hospital Association of South Australia. One organisation- the Hospital Benefit Fund of Western Australia- said that the matter would be discussed at its next management committee meeting, but so far either that committee has not met or we have not been told what it decided. The other major organisation- the Hospital&#39; Benefits Association of Victoria- has not even taken the trouble to reply. I may say that it does seem that although the salaries of the executives of the health insurance funds are paid from the contributions of their members the funds obviously are going to continue to refuse to divulge to their members what salaries are paid to those executives out of the funds that are contributed by the members. </para>

I refer to a question I asked the Minister on 14 October concerning relations between Aborigines and police in Alice Springs. In reply the Minister advised that he would be visiting Alice Springs to have discussions with a Reverend Downing and the police to see whether it was possible to develop a more accurate system of law enforcement. Due to the fact that the Senate is now sitting and will be sitting again next week, thus rendering the Minister unavailable for that visit, could the Minister advise the Senate what action he has taken in relation to the establishment of an inquiry into the alleged rape and murder of Paula Sweet? </para>

I shall go there at the first available opportunity after the passing of the Appropriation Bills and when the Parliament has some respite from continuous sittings. In a Press release on 20 October I announced the establishment of an independent police inquiry into the matter by policemen from the Australian Capital Territory Police Forces. Superintendent G. Kent and Sergeant K. Harley of the Australian Capital Territory Police Force went to Alice Springs and commenced their investigation on 2 1 October. They have been asked to make a report to me on their inquiry and recommendations on future police investigations involving Aborigines. They will be assisted in Alice Springs by Inspector Plumb of the Northern Territory Police Force. </para>

            <para>- I have a couple of comments which, hopefully, will bear on the Cyprus situation. Following the partial lifting of the United States embargo on arms for Turkey, talks between the Turkish Government and the United States Administration on United States bases in Turkey are expected to resume shortly. Elections have been held in Turkey, which may make it possible for the Government there to devote more attention to the pressing need for a political settlement in Cyprus. It is not yet known when the next round of inter-communal talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots will be held, but there now appear to be fewer obstacles to the resumption of these talks than existed a month ago. High on the agenda of these talks will be the definition of the boundaries of the 2 zones. It seems certain that future constitutional arrangements will be discussed also. Australia has consistently taken the view that the solution to the problem of Cyprus must be worked out by the Cypriots themselves. We hope that the discussions will be resumed soon and that they will be continued without interruption until a settlement is reached. </para>

Is the Minister aware that owners of office space in Melbourne suburbs and Victorian provincial cities have been offered rentals at the rate of $6.50 a square foot, without negotiation, for the provision of Medibank offices? Does not this practice contribute to inflation in this section of the economy? Is the practice of offering an inflated high price rather than negotiating extensively for the lowest priced suitable accommodation a standard practice of this Government? If so, how is it justified as a proper use of taxpayers&#39; money? </para>

They received specialist treatment in a recompression chamber at the Navy&#39;s school of underwater medicine. Civilians have always been provided with necessary emergency treatment and will continue to be so provided. </para>

As I understand it, there are members of my Party who do lean towards the Fretilin side. As I understand it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Michael</inline> Darby, who is not a member of my Party, also leans that way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> shakes his head to indicate that I am wrong. If I am wrong, I withdraw it.

No, I do not think any government can or should stop people from expressing what they think in various situations. I was asked on television one night whether we should stop people in our Party from saying these things. I do not think we should. I do not think that is the sort of thing one can do. </para>

            <para>- The importers are advised as early as possible, but I do not think &#39;as early as possible&#39; is as early as is desired by the importers or even by my Department. We do make an effort to advise importers of quota allocations as soon as we can. It must be remembered that on many of the articles the quotas are subject to review after 12 months and it is therefore difficult or even impossible to advise importers of their precise allocation of quotas for the ensuing 12 months until after we have had a review. An announcement was made on 19 September by my colleagues, the Minister for Manufacturing Industry and the Special Minister of State, regarding specific textile products. The following is an extract from that announcement: </para>

            <para>However, for the purposes of forward planning, importers could be assured that their individual quotas in the second year would be no less than the quotas they were allocated in the first year which were derived from their import performances in the appropriate base period. This applies to both the yarns and fabrics and the apparel items concerned. </para>

            <para>- A similar question was asked last week, and I indicated then as I indicate again now that it is a matter of judgment for the Prime Minister as to what action he takes in circumstances such as occurred last year and such as we see now. We are seeing, and we will continue to see, the effect of the Opposition&#39;s tactics on various sections of the Australian community. Of course the Government will continue to govern, notwithstanding all the nonsense that has been going on in the Opposition now for some weeks. There will be difficulties, as has been pointed out, and sections of the Australian community will feel the effects of what the Opposition has done. As regards that part of the question concerning the judgment as to what advice is given by the Prime Minister to the GovernorGeneral, that is a matter entirely for the Prime Minister, and it will remain so. </para>

I have been looking at this question for some time and I have a rather long answer which embodies more than that particular point. I will keep the reply until the end of question time. If I were to interpolate it now I think there would be valid objections. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence. Is it a fact that the Government&#39;s decision to abolish the school cadet system was totally contrary to the recommendations of its own inquiry? What were the arguments advanced by the inquiry for retention of the system, and why was it abandoned in the light of the report? Will the Government review its decision? </para>

            <para>- It is well known why the Government decided to abolish the cadet corps. This was done on the advice of its advisers that the amount of $llm which was spent on the cadet corps should be spent in the defence area. As everybody knows, the schools did not maintain the cadet corps; in fact, the defence Service did. The advisers recommended to the Government that in the light of the present situation, that money could be better spent. A lot of publicity is being given to the fact that the Opposition somehow is committed to change that policy. There has never been any statement at all to that effect. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Killen</inline> has gone on record as saying in the newspapers and in his defence policy is that the Opposition will encourage schools maintaining cadet corps. I suggest to any people who think that the Government&#39;s policy will be changed by another government that the matter has been misrepresented. As regards the other matters which have been raised, for example, the recommendations made in respect of the Citizen Military Forces, I indicate that twenty-two of those recommendations have already been adopted. So I suggest that the complaints which have been made are ill-founded. </para>

There is no possible way that anybody could read that into the remarks that I made yesterday on this very delicate situation.

There was also a report on the air this morning that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Adam</inline> Malik, the Foreign Minister, had intimated that he might make a plane available for our benefit to try to do better than we have been doing in our attempts to see the bodies, if it is at all possible.

            <para>- Under normal circumstances, that is correct. I do not see the relevance of the question. What the country is concerned about and what the Australian people are concerned about is what is going to happen in the period ahead if the Opposition continues its present mad course. That is what the country is concerned about, and it is quite evident from the surveys which are now being published that the overwhelming majority of Australians reject the attitude being taken by the Opposition, as I think a lot of people predicted would be the case if the Opposition set itself on this insane course. Whether the Opposition will come to its senses in the next few weeks remains to be seen, but obviously the Australian people are wide awake to what the Opposition is up to and the damage it is doing to the Australian community. </para>

Among other things, when he was picked up sitting in a motor car in a street of Melbourne and holding a rifle, he gave a long incoherent statement to the police, consistent only with some sort of paranoid condition. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> if he has any real belief in the sanity or mental balance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wechsler,</inline> should also read the transcripts, which I have here if he wants to have them, of various interviews which have been conducted with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wechsler</inline> on television programs.

The leading article which appears in this journal today referring to the proposed national compensation scheme makes a number of misstatements. It states that the cost of the scheme will be a mere $405m a year. If the writer were to read the documents which I have tabled in the Senate and the other statements which have been made he would see that that is a gross cost to be reached in some 20 years and that in fact the net cost during the first year of operation, which would not be until 1977, would be in the vicinity of $300m.

            <para>-I was very startled to read that the Government was trying to force money into the hands of reluctant doctors who, in fact, wanted to take less than we wished to give them. It was a departure of a most unprecedented kind. But that is not an accurate report of the proceedings. The suggestion appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> and also in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review,</inline> although the reports quoted only the  President  of the Australian Medical Association as saying this. The articles did not tell us whether the newspapers agreed. The actual increase in fees determined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mcintosh,</inline> who constituted the inquiry, was 20.5 per cent on the fees determined in December 1974 and applying from 1 January 1975 to 31 December 1975. However, allowing for the 4.2 per cent increase in medical benefit fees determined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mcintosh</inline> in May this year and implemented with the introduction of Medibank from 1 July 1975, the percentage increase on current medical benefit fees will be 15.6 per cent. Allowing for the AMA fees at 1 January 1975, the AMA recommended increase of 12.5 per cent from 1 July 1975 and the proposed further 14 per cent increase from 1 January 1976, in fact the AMA is advocating a 39.9 per cent increase over the year. This compares with the 20.5 per cent increase which was determined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mcintosh,</inline> whose determination will no doubt be accepted by the Government. So, far from the Government advocating more than the Australian Medical Association has sought, in fact, what we are accepting by way of a determination from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mcintosh</inline> is approximately half what the Australian Medical Association is asking for. </para>

Because we do not have a Treasurer&#39;s Advance available as a result of the obstruction by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and his colleagues of the Appropriation Bills, we cannot draw on the Treasurer&#39;s Advance for the money for the Devonfield centre to carry on for the time being. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> get in touch with the Devonfield centre and advise it when he will allow the Appropriation Bills to be passed by the Senate because then the Devonfield centre will receive its money. </para>

It is so obvious, when restraint on demand for wages in such a period can only reasonably be expected if there is also a restraint on prices, that the proposals emanating from the Opposition to abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal are quite incomprehensible. </para>

Is he aware that the Prime Minister referred in this lecture to increasing the profitability and viability of the private sector? Will the Minister in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for the Media note the contents of a speech made at the annual meeting of the Federation of Commercial Television Stations by the Chief Manager of the Bank of New South Wales yesterday? Will he give consideration to the suggestion in that speech that television stations should broadcast newspaper-style editorials which would prevent the free enterprise system being undermined? </para>

            <para>-On the question of the profitability of private enterprise as it relates to the news media, I inform the honourable senator that last week I was invited, as were other honourable senators, to a function held in Canberra by the Australian Association of National Advertisers. At that function advertisers and executive representatives of media interests advised me that at present there was a record booking of advertising time on radio and television. Having said that, I indicate that there must be therefore a fair degree of profitability involved inthat sector of the industry. Frankly, the other portion of the honourable senator&#39;s question is one relating to the standards under the existing Broadcasting and Television Act of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. I refer the honourable senator to section 16 of the Act I would suggest that he should take the matter up with the  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. </para>

            <para>- There has been an individual request in respect of the establishment of a national marketing board for coarse grains but there has been no official approach to the Government by the industry. There are in Australia, of course, a number of State bodies which, individually and in some cases jointly, have jurisdiction over the marketing of certain coarse grains. The question of a national marketing arrangement is one which has been canvassed over the years but because of a lack of common purpose- I daresay that would be the best way to express it- amongst the various industries themselves and the States it has been found to be almost impossible to implement it. It is a matter that has been before the Australian Agricultural Council on a number of occasions. Until such time as a further unified approach is put to the Government for such a national marketing arrangement, I assume that the present arrangements will have to continue. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator will recall that when I was the Minister for the Media I introduced 2 amending Bills to the Broadcasting and Television Act which were refused a second reading in this place. Because those amending Bills were refused a second reading, the matter about which the honourable senator now speaks is the province of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. Program standards and Australian programming arrangements on television are completely a matter for the Australian Broadcasting Control Board as a result of the Opposition&#39;s decision to refuse those Bills a second reading in the Senate. I would therefore suggest that the honourable senator should refer his question to the  Chairman  of the Broadcasting Control Board. </para>

That relates to the Ampol request for approval of a price rise during which considerable evidence on petroleum discounting in Victoria was produced. A senior officer of my Department, on considering the request, decided that as the Department has only one copy of this voluminous document it could not be released. I am also told that it is against copyright law for it to be reproduced. The arrangement agreed to by the senior officer of my Department who considered the matter is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley,</inline> or someone from his office, will call at my Department to peruse the transcript, which is a public document. My Department had no alternative but to retain our only copy. </para>

            <para>- I can answer very easily the latter part of the question. We have been spending money on sheltered workshops at a greater rate than was anticipated. We quite readily admit that. We do not deny it for one moment. We have been engaged in very substantial expenditure on sheltered workshops. It has exceeded the moneys available to us in the last Budget for that purpose. Therefore, it was necessary to resort to the Advance to the Treasurer. It is part of the appropriations which have not been passed. I am afraid that I do not have the other figures in my head. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> to put his question on the notice paper, and I will obtain a reply for him. </para>

            <para>-So far the service has been provided in 3 State capitals- Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. During the year from 1 July 1974 to 30 June 1975 there was a very great number of calls on all sorts of matters- more than 30 000 in Melbourne, approximately 22 000 in Sydney and approximately 7500 in Perth. The service has been so successful that we certainly propose to extend it as soon as the funds are made available by the Opposition in the Senate. I suppose that initially the service would need to be extended to the other State capitals- Adelaide, Brisbane and Hobart- which do not have this service. As it has been such a success, it would seem to me to be very important that provincial centres such as Geelong, Ballarat, Wollongong and Newcastle, where there are large numbers of immigrants, should have the same service provided. </para>

            <para>- It is indeed ironic that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> or any member of the Opposition should ask whether the Government has documents which can establish one way or the other whether such promissory notes exist or by whom they are signed. I have been given the impression that the Opposition has in its hands at the present time a gentleman by the name of Khemlani who has all the evidence to damn this Government for ever. But every time there is an invitation to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> to come before the Senate so that we may ask him some questions, the Opposition backs off. The Opposition has had weeks of opportunity to do all these things. So why does it not come up with the evidence that it claims it has had for months instead of engaging in all this pussy-footing around, asking irrelevant questions about documents and promissory notes? Does the Opposition expect me to know about all of the documents that have been tabled and which might be in the possession of the Government or other individuals. As I have said on numerous occasions, the documents which the Government considers relevant to this matter have been tabled. Other documents and other information may be sought by placing questions on the notice paper, and I suggest that Sen ator Wright do just that. </para>

              <para>- Thank you. Secondly, I suggest to you that it is completely beneath the dignity of this chamber to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> to refer to an honourable senator as an animal. Although you promptly suppress any imputation from this side, you do not take note of the 2 matters to which I have referred. I consider that you should take deep consideration as to the elements of impartiality that should be brought to the conduct of the chamber. </para>

              <para>- The position was that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> made some interjection which I did not hear. An exception was taken to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> said also that he was threatened. I wanted to hear the case about his claim that he had been threatened. Points of order were taken by various honourable senators, and I was hearing about the situation. I strongly object to the language that was used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> in the process of my hearing the points of order. But at the conclusion of the points of order I had intended to ask for the necessary withdrawals and apologies. I call <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill.</inline></para>

          <para>The Government has viewed with concern widespread reports that Indonesia is involved in military intervention in Portuguese Timor. The position of the Australian Government is clear. We deplore the fighting in the border areas. We continue to believe that a solution to the problems in Portuguese Timor should be sought through peaceful means and free of external intervention. Indonesia has been told of our views in this regard and urged to pursue her interests through diplomatic means. If there is one ray of hope in a gloomy situation, it is the possibility that talks will at last get under way. The Indonesian Foreign Minister has agreed to meet with his Portuguese counterpart in Europe this week. Fretilin and UDT have also signified in recent days their willingness to hold separate talks with the Portuguese. We hope that Apodeti will also agree to talks with the Portuguese, and that all three parties will reconsider their present refusal to talk to each other. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government strongly supports resolution of the conflict in Portuguese Timor by peaceful means through which the will of the people will be expressed. We have made numerous representations to this effect to the Portuguese, to the Indonesians, and to the representatives of Fretilin who have visited Australia. I have very recently instructed the Australian Ambassadors in Lisbon and Jakarta to reiterate to the Portuguese and Indonesian Governments our firm hope that the talks between these two governments later this week result in a positive and constructive outcome. Were all the parties to wish it, the Government would be prepared to offer an Australian venue for round-table talks. That the situation in Portuguese Timor has come to its present pass is, of course, cause for deep regret. It reflects, above all, the immaturity of Timor&#39;s own aspiring political leaders, who in less than eighteen months have succeeded in wrecking Portugal&#39;s decolonisation program, sharply polarising political opinions through the territory, and finally plunging the territory into violent civil war. The past 18 months have turned out to be a graveyard of all those earlier hopes that the Timorese politicians, representing a small Western-educated elite, would shelve their differences for the sake of the territory at large. </para>
          <para>Nor can the Portuguese escape their share of the responsibility. Portugal is the administering power, but it was very much weakness of purpose on the part of the Portuguese administration which allowed the UDT &#39;show of force&#39; in early August to develop into a probably unintended coup and thus provoked the Fretilin counter-coup. It seems that: Timor, like Angola, has become part of the debris of the Portuguese revolution. From the time of the overthrow of the Caetano regime in Lisbon and the subsequent decision of the Portuguese to shed their overseas territories, the Australian Government had hoped that the decolinisation process in Portuguese Timor could proceed in an orderly fashion which allowed the people of the territory to decide their own future. We had hoped that Portugal would remain in control for a period long enough for the political consciousness of the people to develop to the point where there was a substantial measure of agreement regarding the future. </para>
          <para>The need for orderly progress had also been of paramount importance in view of the interest of the countries of the region, particularly Indonesia but also Australia and other regional countries, in ensuring that the territory would not emerge in a way which would have an unsettling effect on the region. These hopes which the Government had worked hard to see realized have unhappily not been borne out. Portugal&#39;s inability, or reluctance to retain control opened the way to a struggle for supremacy among a number of essentially immature, rival political factions. From this struggle the Fretilin group, aided by the Timorese army units and by access to Portuguese arms, emerged as being stronger than its rivals. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government had still hopedand acted accordingly- that agreement on the future of the territory could have been reached by negotiation between Portugal and the main contending factions. But the meeting scheduled for 20 September did not take place, at least in part because of the intransigence of Fretilin, which has continued to claim to the United Nations and the world in general that it is the only authentic and legitimate voice of Portuguese Timor. Fretilin has since agreed that it will speak to the Portuguese- but not, yet, to the other parties. So has UDT; but UDT, too, is now attempting to lay down preconditions, while at one stage in their approach to talks the overriding concern of the Portuguese seemed to be with the fate of the Portuguese prisoners held by UDT. Fretilin has cetainly now said that it continues to recognise Portuguese sovereignty and the right of Portugal to preside over the decolonisation process. </para>
          <para>It is in this situation of drift, of Fretilin&#39;s refusal to accept that UDT or Apodeti has anything further to contribute to the decolonisation process, and of Portugal &#39;s regrettable inability to reassert its authority in the territory, that we view the various policy pronouncements, newspaper reports and the like from Jakarta and Timor itself. Were there substance in these reports, the Australian Government would be extremely disappointed, and we have so informed the Indonesian authorities. The Australian Government has urged that Indonesia pursue her interests through diplomatic means. We have told the Indonesians that we remain opposed to the use of armed force. We have also said that we are firm in the view that the people of Portuguese Timor should be allowed to determine their own future. We have urged the Indonesian authorities to reaffirm their own public commitment to the principle of self-determination in Portuguese Timor. </para>
          <para>Indonesia can, of course, point to the presence of over 40 000 refugees in her territory- some 7 per cent of Portuguese Timor&#39;s entire population. She can correctly claim that Fretilin has established its present position of supremacy because it controlled the army and not necessarily because it had overwhelming popular support. Indonesia can argue, as indeed we ourselves have been inclined to argue, that before the recent troubles UDT was vying with, and possibly exceeding, Fretilin in terms of popular support. All this is not to excuse Indonesia&#39;s reported actions but perhaps goes some way towards explaining them. We should not lose sight of Indonesia&#39;s concern about order and stability in Portuguese Timor, which is located in the middle of the Indonesian archipelago. It is necessary that we, the Portuguese and the parties in Timor should recognise the importance of the Indonesian interest in the territory, just as other countries in the region do. </para>
          <para>No more than Indonesia, can Australia accept any one party&#39;s claim to be the only true representative of Portuguese Timor. Fretilin may have prevailed over its rivals in the initial round of fighting and skirmishing, but it has established no right thereby to speak for all Timorese. These matters should not be settled by force of arms. What if the Timorese army had decided to side with the UDT, or with Apodeti, or had staged a purely military coup? Of course, nor can UDT or </para>
          <para class="block">Apodeti claim to speak for the people of Portuguese Timor simply because they are not attempting to demonstrate some military capacity in conflict with Fretilin. These matters, I repeat, should not be settled by force. The Australian Government does not pretend to know what the people of Portuguese Timor want. But we do want them to have the opportunity to say what they want. The need in our view, is to get all the parties round the table for talks. The Australian Government is doing what it can to help such talks on their way. </para>

          <para class="block">October <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> asked me the following question, without notice: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I ask the Minister for Labor and Immigration whether there is any truth in the report that Australia has refused to allow refugees from Vietnam who are highly qualified professionally to enter Australia from a Hong Kong holding centre. As the report maintains that the decision is denying family re-union, will the Minister investigate the claims and the report and give the maximum humanitarian consideration to any problems? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The reply which I now have for the honourable senator is that I am informed that 1133 Vietnamese have arrived in Australia since 1 April 1975, of whom 1034 were granted permanent residence. Of these persons, 63 were admitted on the grounds that they satisfied the normal migrant entry requirements, including the current occupation requirements. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> asked specifically about Vietnamese admitted from Hong Kong. Australia admitted 203 Vietnamese from Hong Kong at the request of the Government of that colony. Those selected were those judged most in need of humanitarian assistance which resettlement in Australia would provide and who were not likely to receive such assistance from another country. The group included a number of persons of professional or sub-professional qualifications obtained in Vietnam. Their qualifications, however, are not recognised in Australia. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- During the first quarter of the period covered by the Commission&#39;s second annual report it became apparent that the economy was operating at less than full capacity. The Government subsequently moved to ensure that structural change resulting from lower assistance did not add to total unemployment. A number of measures were introduced to limit imports. These apply to a range of products including clothing, textiles, footwear, motor vehicles, domestic appliances and sheet steel. The range of short-term measures currently operating, following recommendations of the Temporary Assistance Authority and the Textiles Authority, will be reviewed once the Commission has reported on the longterm assistance requirements of the industries concerned. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The Commission has shown that it is well aware that short-term problems can intrude into the consideration of longer term issues, particularly when the general level of activity in the economy is below normal, and that appropriate action must be introduced to cope with them. In its annual report, however, it has, as I believe it should, focused attention mainly on the longer term issues associated with the development of industries. </para>
        <para>The Government&#39;s intention in establishing the IAC was to extend the Tariff Board system of public inquiries and reports to all sectors of the economy, in order to ensure greater consistency and coherence in the provision of assistance to industries, and thereby promote the interests of the community generally. To this end, it is necessary to development criteria for the development of industries generally rather than any one sector at the expense of the others. The Commission&#39;s basic approach is to encourage the use of resources, particularly new resources, in those activities which use them most efficiently. Such an approach involves the gradual reduction in assistance to high cost industries. It also involves the provision of positive measures to improve the mobility, quality and productivity of resources generally in the economy. This approach has received general support from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in the Industry Committee&#39;s report on Australia. In addition, the Commission, while rejecting a general strategy of raising assistance to low cost industries, has indicated that in particular cases it may recommend the provision of additional assistance to low cost industries. It may also recommend short-term assistance to enable low cost activities to hold resources necessary for their long-term development. </para>
        <para>The Commission has devoted considerable attention in its report to structural change in the economy. It has discussed in some detail the nature and causes of structural change and capacity of the economy to cope with such change. It emphasises the lesser importance for industry of changes in Government assistance compared to exchange rate changes, demands for higher wages and internal economic developments. There is now general agreement that structural change resulting from changes in Government assistance must proceed at a pace the economy can manage. This requires that tariff changes are handled flexibly. As the Commission makes clear, the capacity of the economy to cope with change is dependent upon the general level of activity in the economy, the mobility of the community&#39;s resources and the availability of adequate adjustment assistance mechanisms. The Government recognises that the costs of changes, in assistance which are designed to benefit the whole community should not be borne only by individuals directly affected by those changes and has introduced a variety of measures to assist individuals, firms and regions to adjust to structural changes. </para>
        <para>I remind honourable senators of the letter of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> to the  Chairman  of the IAC in November 1974. The Prime Minister, in agreeing with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rattigan</inline> on the need to relate changes in assistance to the economy&#39;s capacity to adapt to such change, said that the Government required the fullest information on the social and locational effects of the Commission&#39;s recommendations. I therefore welcome the steps being taken by the Commission to analyse systematically and comprehensively the likely social and locational as well as the economic effects of implementing its recommendations. In particular, I welcome the recent initiative of the Commission to invite major community groups to involve themselves on a consultative basis in its general research work concerned with the development of Australian industries, such as its research into the effects of demographic changes on the structure of industries, and its investigations into the structure and mobility of the labour force. Research into the effects of demographic change which was initiated as a joint project between the Commission and the Department of Labor and Immigration now involves the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Department of Manufacturing Industry. I understand that a wide range of industry, consumer and trade union organisations have accepted the Commission&#39;s invitation. </para>
        <para>The Commission&#39;s decision that more of its work should be concerned with identifying, researching and providing well-documented advice on likely changes in the environment for industry development should help to ensure that the social and economic effects of changes in assistance to industries are fully researched before Government decisions are taken. The Commission&#39;s research program should also provide useful information to producers and investors. It will help them to anticipate future changes and to plan for the future with more confidence. These various initiatives, together with the progressive movement toward the publication of draft reports on individual inquiries, in which I have taken a particular interest, will extend and give greater meaning to the concept of public scrutiny which is an integral feature of the advisory process for assistance to industries in Australia. The Commission is to be commended on the way it has coped with the demands placed upon it by tariff revision inquiries and the heavy program of inquiries associated with the new fields of rural, mining and tertiary industries. I commend for reading its very informative annual report to honourable senators. I now seek leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a statement by me on action taken during 1974-75 in respect of reports made to me by the Industries Assistance Commission or by the Temporary Assistance Authority under Part IV of the Industries Assistance Commission Act 1973. </para>

This is an interesting statement on the Industries Assistance Commission because it points out certain things which are really quite fascinating. It states that it became apparent to the IAC that the economy was operating at less than full capacity. It took the IAC some little time to find that out, if it were a body of experts. The report states that the IAC was concerned about the structural change on total unemployment. But unemployment has gone on steadily increasing. One therefore has some reservations about the skill and perception </para>

        <para class="block">of the IAC because Australia&#39;s unemployment and lack of capacity utilisation, to a very great extent, came out of the recommendations of the IAC in the first place that tariffs should be reduced 25 per cent across the board. I think the IAC has been one of the principal architects of disaster and difficulty for a great spectrum of Australian manufacturing industry. The IAC has been a contributor towards growing unemployment in Australia and it should not seek to excuse itself of its responsibility in its annual report. It has certainly taken some temporary measures to help in various areas of industry. When it has done so it has had my support and the support of the Opposition. The report states that the IAC is well aware that short term problems can intrude into the consideration - </para>

            <para>-Honourable senators will recall that in August when I tabled the first main report of the Poverty Commission- the Henderson Report- I mentioned that it would be followed in due course by 4 other main reports covering areas of particular concern to the other Poverty Commissioners. The main report I am now tabling is by Professor Ronald Sackville from the Faculty of Law, University of New South Wales, who is the Commissioner responsible for investigating the effect of the law and the legal system upon poor people and other disadvantaged groups and individuals in the Australian community. This report has just been received by the Government and is still in manuscript form. Arrangements have been made for it to be printed as quickly as possible but printed copies are not likely to be available until early next year. Because of this, and the interest in the reports of the Poverty Commission, I am tabling the report in manuscript form. </para>

        </continue>
        <para>So that people will have immediate access to it, I have arranged for manuscript copies to be placed in the Parliamentary Library, in each State Library, and in the Australian National University Library in Canberra. In addition, the report can be seen at the offices of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Brisbane respectively. </para>
        <para>Professor Sackville makes sweeping recommendations for change in many areas of Federal and State law. The Government is greatly appreciative of the efforts of Professor Sackville and the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, and it will give early and close attention to the important findings and recommendations contained in the second main report. </para>

            <para class="block">During the debate the Special Minister of State emphasised the course of presenting evidence to  His  Honour. I seek appointment to submit to the Commission that there be the further inquiry urged by the Senate. My submission is that the inquiry be re-opened and conducted by the Commission and that if necessary to ensure evidence is available at such inquiry summonses be issued for witnesses to attend and give evidence. I would appreciate if appointment is to be granted that an early opportunity be provided when my attendance at a sitting of the Senate is not required and that such opportunity be afforded before decision is given by  His  Honour on reported application by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> for further inquiry. </para>

The Opposition has no objection to Government business taking precedence over general business this day. It may have been anticipated that the Opposition would wish to proceed with my notice of motion No. 17 which has just been declared not formal. However, I understand, and I do not think the Government would mind me saying this, that if I had moved my motion it would have sought an adjournment, that being the normal procedure so that it could consult with colleagues in Cabinet and Caucus. Consequently the motion would not have been disposed of today. I therefore consider it an exercise in futility to commence a motion today which would not be concluded today.

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment of capital grants to the States in 1 975-76 totalling $430,333,000. This amount represents the grant component of the State governments &#39; Loan Council programs for 1975-76 and is equal to one-third of the total programs- a slightly higher percentage share than in 1974-75. The Bill also provides for the payment of capital grants in the first 6 months of 1976-77 up to an amount equal to one-half of the 1975-76 amount pending passage of similar legislation in that year. Payments authorised under this Bill may be made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or from the Loan Fund, and appropriate borrowing authority is included. These grants represent a continuation of arrangements initiated in June 1970 under which the Australian Government provides a portion of the State governments&#39; Loan Council programs in the form of interestfree grants in lieu of what would otherwise be borrowings by the States. The savings to the States in debt charges resulting from these capital grants are substantial. </para>
          <para>At its meeting in June 1975, the Loan Council approved programs for the State governments totalling $1,291,000,000, consisting of a basic program of $1,281,000,000, and a special permanent addition of $10,000,000 for New South Wales in recognition of that State &#39;s relatively low per head share of Loan Council programs when compared with other States. The programs agreed to for both South Australia and Tasmania are, however, $6m lower than they would otherwise have been, as they take into account the savings that will be made in the States&#39; capital works programs as a result of the proposed transfer of South Australia&#39;s non-metropolitan railway system and of Tasmania&#39;s railway system to the Australian Government as from 1 July 1975. The basic program for 1975-76 of $1,281,000,000 represents an effective increase, that is after adjustment for the effects of the railway &#39;offsets&#39;, of 20 per cent over the 1974-75 basic program. When account is taken of the special permanent addition of $10,000,000 for New South Wales, the increase in the total 1975-76 program over the 1974-75 basic program, becomes 20.9 per cent. The figure of 20 per cent represented the Australian Government&#39;s best, albeit very approximate, estimate of possible cost increases in the capital works field in 1975-76. In other words, the intention was to maintain the programs at roughly the same &#39;real&#39; level as in the previous year. </para>
          <para>The 1975-76 State Government Loan Council program is made up of borrowings totalling $860,667,000 and capital grants, to be provided by the Australian Government, of $430,333,000. At its June 1975 meeting the Loan Council also approved an increase of$132.Im, or 20 percent, in the basic borrowing programs for State authorities classified as &#39;larger&#39; authorities for this purpose. In 1974-75 these were semigovernment and local authorities whose individual borrowings for the year exceeded $500,000. For 1975-76 the Loan Council agreed to increase this amount to $700,000. There is no overall limit on borrowings of authorities whose individual borrowings amount to $700,000 or less in that year. </para>
          <para>The &#39;larger&#39; authorities total program of $809.7m also includes special permanent additions of $10,000,000 for New South Wales on the same basis as the permanent addition to its State Government program to which I have already referred, and $7,075,000 for Queensland under arrangements agreed at the June 1968 Loan Council meeting in respect of the termination, at 30 June 1975, of the issue of variable interest stock by that State&#39;s Southern </para>
          <para class="block">Electricity Authority. Further details concerning the Loan Council programs of the States and their authorities for 1975-76 may be found in chapter III of the Budget paper &#39;Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities 1975-76&#39;. </para>
          <para>Turning to the details of the Bill, clause 3 authorises the payment of grants to the States totalling $430,333,000 in 1975-76 and clause 4 authorises the Treasurer to make advance payments in the first 6 months of 1976-77 at the same annual rate as in the current financial year. The amounts for each State are set out in the Schedule to the Bill. Under clause 5 of the Bill payments may be made either from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or the Loan Fund and clause 9 provides for the necessary appropriation of these funds. The extent to which the payments will be met from the Loan Fund will depend on borrowings during the year, which cannot be estimated in advance. Clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill authorise the Treasurer to borrow funds in the period from t he commencement of the Act to the end of December 1976, up to the total of the amounts of the grants payable in 1975-76 and in the first 6 months of 1976-77. This borrowing authority will be reduced by the amount of any borrowings made before the commencement of this Act, under the authority of the States Grants (Capital Assistance) Act 1974, which may have been used to finance grants made in the first 6 months of 1975-76. </para>
          <para>The payments which it is proposed be authorised by this legislation are, of course, but one element in the total scheme of Australian Government Assistance to the States and they need to be considered in that context. The total picture in relation to assistance to the States in 1975-76 will be discussed in the second reading speech introducing the States Grants Bill 1975. It should suffice to say here that the Government is convinced that an objective examination of the matter would show that the State governments and their authorities have been treated most handsomely indeed in the Budget. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para class="block">As honourable senators will know, the provision of effective protection for the consumer is one of the stated aims of the Australian Labor Party. It is a theme which underlies many of the Government&#39;s other aims; its plans in the social, economic, industrial and environmental fields; its plans in research and development and in law reform are all conceived with a clear recognition of the interests of.the Australian consumer. Useful moves have already been made to provide measures of consumer protection in Australia, but these have mostly been fragmentary in nature. The Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> does not want to decry in any way the valuable achievements that have been made by consumer bodies and by the State governments. On the contrary, the Minister commends them for their splendid efforts. That they have achieved as much, without legislative support from the Australian Government, is a tribute to them. That they will achieve so much more in the future is the assurance that the Minister can give them with the introduction of this legislation. </para>
          <para class="block">Let me state clearly at the outset that it is not the Minister&#39;s intention that the new Authority should take over the functions of the State Bureaus. Its role will be to work in close liaison with them. It will complement their work, not compete with it. The Authority, by looking over the whole field on a&#39; national basis, will be able to identify and act quickly against malpractice which crosses State boundaries. The Minister invites the States, where they are able to make a continuing contribution to the work of the Authority. He intends to have regular meetings with the State Ministers for Consumer Affairs, and is confident that between them they will provide a formal link with the Authority at an appropriate level. </para>
          <para>The object of the Bill is to establish a statutory authority to give effect on a co-ordinated nationwide basis to the comprehensive policies which we have for the protection of the consumer. This authority will be the administrative centre for consumer protection. It will be the hub of Australian Government involvement in consumer protection and the point of contact for State consumer affairs bodies. It will be the agency to which the general public and the many splendid voluntary consumer groups can look for the assistance which they so fully deserve in their work to protect the public. It will also be the source for completely new initiatives in the setting of national standards and the testing of consumer products. </para>
          <para>Before dealing with the most important features of the Bill, I must refer briefly to the work of the Interim Commission on Consumer Standards which was established by the Minister&#39;s predecessor in October 1973. It was directed to canvass the opinions of consumers on the need for consumer standards and to suggest how the desired standards might best reflect public need and how their development might be facilitated. The Interim Commission was also asked to examine general issues pertinent to consumer protection, to encourage the formation of a federation of consumer organisations, to investigate consumer education, to arrange liaison between Federal and State consumer officials and, most importantly, to make recommendations about a permanent body that should ultimately take its place. One of the achievements of the Interim Commission was to bring together consumer organisations to form the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations. This now enables a consumer viewpoint to be expressed with the backing of the Federation. The criticism that the consumer movement only represents small sectional interests can no longer be sustained. </para>
          <para>The Interim Commission&#39;s report, which was tabled in this House in July 1 974, strongly urged the establishment of a permanent statutory authority with wide powers to undertake all those activities necessary to develop soundly based consumer standards. An essential part of the processes leading to the adoption of mandatory standards was seen by the Interim Commission to be the conduct of public hearings. With that view the Minister is in complete agreement. The Minister would like honourable senators to note that many of the recommendations of the Interim Commission have been incorporated in the Bill. Since the work of the Interim Commission was completed, the Minister has given the most searching thought to the needs of setting and enforcing national standards for consumer protection. The Minister is firmly of the view that this very necessary need can only be achieved effectively if all its <inline font-style="italic">aspects</inline> are brought together under one authority which has the constitutional power to set and enforce these standards. He is equally sure that this is what the public wants of the Australian Government. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will know that the Trade Practices Act includes provisions directed towards consumer protection. For the reasons which the Minister has given, he did not want to have a dichotomy of Government responsibilityvested partly in the Trade Practices Commission and partly in a consumer standards commission. The proposal, therefore, which is incorporated in the Bill is for a single Australian Consumer Protection Authority which will bring together the functions and powers presently exercised by the Trade Practices Commission in relation to the legal aspects of consumer protection, as well as the technical functions and activities needed to establish a sound base for consumers to be given accurate and adequate information about consumer goods. We will not be trying to force everyone to have Rolls Royce models of everything, but we should put them in the position where, especially in the major purchases they make, they can select on the basis of accurate information. At present many of the major purchases such as carpets, refrigerators, stoves and so on, are made without adequate information. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will know that the Minister&#39;s portfolio encompasses science, technology, and consumer affairs. The connection linking consumer interests with applied science and technology is readily apparent. Many products of our technological society have found their way to consumers through slick sales publicity designed to condition the psychological processes that now <inline font-style="italic">fashion</inline> the kind of society in which we live. In respect of the goods which we seem to value highly nowadays- cars, television sets, refrigerators and so on- the consumer has little early say in decisions which culminate in the range of services and products on the market. Worse still, he has no knowledge of some of the most undesirable side effects of modern science and technology. Thus the consumer is, at one and the same time, both a beneficiary and a victim of modern technology. It is therefore the Minister&#39;s aim to achieve better public understanding and more public invovlement in the complex interactions between technology and industry on the one hand, and consumer protection on the other. </para>
          <para>The Authority will be of positive value to Australian industry. The potential benefits are obvious. With national standards set in co-operation with the States, manufacturers will no longer have to worry about having to meet different requirements in different States. It will protect local manufacturers as well as consumers against imported goods which do not meet Australian standards. These standards will be set in close consultation with local industry. Such consultation will be designed to ensure that no standards are set without a full understanding of what the cost effects will be. For these reasons, reputable Australian manufacturers will have nothing to fear. They will, in fact, benefit from the knowledge that the authority will restrict the activities of unscrupulous firms which give industry a bad name. The Minister has studied developments in the field of consumer protection in many overseas countries. It is evident to him that, whilst much good work has been done in this country in the field of consumer protection, we lag far behind what is being done overseas. I emphasise, however, that this Bill is not a carbon copy of anything from overseas. It incorporates the best features of overseas practice, selected to suit Australian conditions, and includes some innovations of its own. </para>
          <para>I now turn to the Bill itself and I will confine my remarks to broad concepts rather than going into details. The first part of the Bill comprises definitions only and needs no further comment. Part II of the Bill describes the powers and functions of the Authority. It will be seen that they derive from the recommendations of the Interim Standards Commission and from the functions transferred from the Trade Practices Commission. In summary, the functions of the Authority will cover the whole gamut of consumer affairs. It will liaise with, and support, consumer groups and prepare and distribute educational information. The Authority will also work together with persons engaged in advertising, trade or commerce, and keep such persons informed of its activities. It will enforce consumers&#39; rights by examining unsatisfactory trade practices and taking legal action when necessary. Its other main function will be to study the quality of goods and services, by the testing of consumer goods and by developing and enforcing, where necessary, consumer standards. The Authority will, however, seek to persuade rather than penalise. </para>
          <para>In the performance of its function, the Authority will be obliged to avail itself of resources and facilities of other bodies or authorities engaged in the formulation of such standards and will play a co-ordinating role to this effect. The Minister has already spoken of his desire for the Authority to work in harmony with State agencies. Honourable senators will notice that Part III of the Bill is identical with Part V of the </para>
          <para class="block">Trade Practices Act. The only changes are to Clauses 21 and 22, and these changes are of a machinery nature. The intention then is clear: To give the proposed Authority the consumer protection functions now exercised by the Trade Practices Commission. After this legislation comes into force, the corresponding sections will be deleted from the Trade Practices Act. Officers of the Trade Practices Commission who are currently devoted to the administration of Part V of the Trade Practices Act are to be transferred to the Ministry of Science and Consumer Affairs The Minister can therefore give an assurance that there is no intention to duplicate activities or to build up a large bureaucracy. In fact, the Authority will comprise a small core of permanent staff supported, where necessary, by specialists drawn from States, industry and universities, on a seconded or contract basis. Specialist task forces will also be established for specific short-term duties. </para>
          <para>Part IV of the Bill deals with the Authority&#39;s role in respect of consumer product standards and in particular with the public actions which it must take before recommending to the Minister that a standard be adopted or revoked. The duties of the Minister in relation to this process and to Parliament are clearly laid down in the Bill. Part V provides for the notification, to the Authority by manufacturers, distributors and retailers of substantial product hazards. The related powers of the Industrial Court and the Authority are clearly defined. Part VI of the Bill makes provision for wide public debate on consumer protection matters and particularly the development of mandatory standards. </para>
          <para>The Authority will be concerned with standards for consumer goods, and many of those standards will enjoy the force of law. It is therefore important that, before such standards are introduced, all the consequences of their introduction are assessed and appreciatedespecially by the general public whose interests are at stake. It would be easy to write standards which appear to be desirable from the consumer viewpoint, but which would later be found to entail serious disadvantages to manufacturers. It is therefore important to set standards which are feasible, economically viable, and technologically and socially desirable- standards giving the consumer the best practical result, without making unrealistic demands on industry. The powers of the Authority in regard to public hearings have therefore been spelt out in some detail. These clauses follow closely those applicable to the Industries Assistance Commission in regard to its public hearings. Honourable senators will notice that witnesses may be compelled to give evidence but at the same time they are protected from intimidatory practices. Where matters of evidence are genuinely confidential, they will be protected. </para>
          <para>Part VII of the Bill deals with enforcement and remedies. This Part contains, unaltered, the enforcement provisions of Part VI of the Trade Practices Act. Part VIII describes the structure of the proposed Authority. It will be headed by a Commissioner and up to 5 Assistant Commissioners. The Commissioner will be a statutory officer having the powers of a Permanent Head. Part IX of the Bill deals with &#39;finance&#39;, and I shall not go into details on this matter. Part X makes provision to establish an advisory council consisting of not more than 20 persons, chosen primarily because of their active interest in the field of consumer affairs. Whilst they will not be representative of particular organisations, nevertheless they will be chosen so as to cover the interests of all cross sections of the community. </para>
          <para>The Bill also contains a number of necessary machinery clauses, as for example the need to present annual reports to Parliament. The Minister foresees such reports as being most useful documents and powerful forces for good through the exposure of malpractice and the lauding of good practice. Honourable senators will also note that any reports to the Minister by the Authority must be listed in the report. Provision is made to protect manufacturers and to provide them with access to the Authority before the disclosure of information, as well as in the investigation of substantial product hazards. There is also provision for the adoption of international conventions and internationally adopted standards. </para>
          <para>Before concluding, I want to indicate an important aspect of the way in which the Authority will operate. Consumer products cover a very wide range, and there are already many agencies working in the field. For example, the Therapeutic Goods Act already makes provision for the Minister for Health to determine standards for therapeutic goods and for their packaging and labelling, and to prevent their distribution if they do not comply with those requirements. The Therapeutic Goods Standards Committee, the Therapeutic Goods Advisory Committee, and the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, have been established to advise the Minister for Health in his administration of that Act. Samples of therapeutic goods subject to the Therapeutic Goods Act are examined, tested and analysed by the National Biological Standards Laboratory, a division of the Department of </para>
          <para class="block">Health. In addition, the National Biological Standards Laboratory researches and prepares draft standards for consideration by the Therapeutic Goods Standards Committee and the Therapeutic Goods Advisory Committee. </para>
          <para>It is intended that the Authority in exercising its functions will not disturb either the existing procedure for the determination and application of standards for therapeutic goods by the Minister for Health or the functions of the bodies established under the Therapeutic Goods Regulations. The Food Standards Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council, which includes representatives of State governments, consumer interests and the food industry, has for many years carried out the function of formulating food standards. It has been aided by its specialist advisory committees on food additives, food microbiology, food and analysis and food science and technology. </para>
          <para>Transport is another area in which the Consumer Protection Authority will be able to make a strong consumer input in co-operation with existing agencies for the formulation and determination of standards. In the case of aircraft, the Air Navigation Act and Regulations provides a basis for the establishment and enforcement of standards. In the important case of motor vehicles, ACPA will become a major new force in the formulation and implementation of standards in consultation with the Australian Transport Advisory Council. The Authority will be able to place the onus and sanctions where they belong- with the manufacturers, importers and distribution networks. Moreover, the Authority will be able to look critically at the way in which vehicles and associated services are being merchandised and to protect the individual motorist when difficulties arise. </para>
          <para>Clause 7 (2) of the Bill will enable the Consumer Protection Authority to take advantage of the expertise and experience, in the health field, of the Food Standards Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council; and in transport, the Road Safety and Standards Authority and the specialist advisory committees of the Australian Transport Advisory Council. Complementary arrangements will also be made to enable the latter bodies to take advantage of the expertise and experience of the Consumer Protection Authority. There is no intention that the Authority should take over that activity. Its role will rather be to work through existing organisations- and to co-ordinate their work, to comment on-their work, and to indicate to them areas requiring attention. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, let me say that every member of Parliament is in some way or other a consumer. All of us have been dissatisfied from time to time with the quality of goods we have bought; with the lack of information about products; with the service we have received; or with the fine print in the contract we have signed. This Bill provides the greatest step forward so far taken in protecting the rights to which we as consumers and members of the Australian public are entitled. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

              <para>-The purpose of the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill is to authorise the Treasurer to pay to the States this year the sum of $364.6m for welfare housing in accordance with the provisions of the 1973-1974 Housing Agreement. It will be distributed among the States as follows: </para>

          </para>
          <para>Welfare housing is an area to which the Government attaches high priority. Bearing in mind the $ 10.4m advanced in June 1975 on the basis that it would be taken into account in this year&#39;s allocation, the advances in 1975-76 will be maintained at the greatly increased 1974-75 level, and well above the $2 18.6m allocated in 1973-74. They will also be some 2V4 times greater than the allocations for welfare housing from State loan funds in the last 2 years of the previous Government which were $161. 5 m in 1971-72 and $163.2m in 1972-73. This is the real measure of the importance attached to welfare housing by the present Government in comparison with our predecessors. </para>
          <para>The decision to limit the welfare housing advances for 1975-76 to the 1974-75 level has been a difficult one for the Government to take. It will, however, be recalled that the large increase in the advances in 1974-75 was in part due to the sharp downturn that had developed in private housing construction. It was appropriate for public housing activity to be stepped up above the original allocations in order to increase the output of welfare housing and also to use resources that otherwise may well have remained idle. Although the allocations for 1975-76 are limited by the budgetary constraints aimed at achieving greater economic stability and the control of inflation, they by no means reflect an intention to divert from a course that will ensure further improvements in welfare housing standards. However, there is significant evidence of recovery in the private home building sector. Private commencements had started to recover in the March quarter and the improvement has been maintained in the June quarter when 28 200 dwellings were commenced, about 10 per cent more than in the preceding December quarter. Approvals of private dwellings in the June quarter exceeded 30 000 compared with about 24 000 in the December quarter. The number of housing loans approved by savings banks and permanent building societies was maintained at a very high level throughout the first half of 1975 and this should ensure further growth in commencements in the coming months. In these circumstances, it would have been economically irresponsible to continue to increase the government housing sector at the pace established in the special circumstances of the last financial year. It is contrary to the interests of the housing industry and the aspirations of prospective home buyers to seek to return to the over-stretched demand situation which existed in 1 973-74. A return to that situation is contrary to the best interests of the economy as a whole and all persons concerned with home ownership. Nevertheless, although it may not be possible to maintain commencement of government dwellings at the same level as in 1974-75, the still substantial advances to be provided in 1975-76 will allow the completion by the State housing authorities of a much higher number of welfare dwellings than has been the case for many years and this will be occurring along with the recovery in private housing now in train. </para>
          <para>The Bill also authorises the Treasurer to pay to the States in the first 6 months of 1976-77 the sum of $ 182.3m, which is half the allocation for 1975-76. This amount will be distributed on the same basis as the advances for the current year. In other words, the Treasurer will be authorised to continue payments to the States for welfare housing in the period from 1 July 1976 until an appropriation measure for 1976-77 is passed by the Parliament. The advances to be authorised by the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill are repayable over a period of 53 years. The rate of interest payable on advances during the full 5-year term of the Agreement is fixed at 4 per cent per annum in respect of advances allocated to the State housing authorities and 41/2 per cent per annum in respect of advances allocated to the Home Builders&#39; Accounts of the States. The apportionment of each State&#39;s allocation between its housing authority and its Home Builders&#39; Account was formally determined by the Minister for Housing and Construction on 12 September 1975 after further consultation between the Minister and the Housing Minister of each State. The amounts determined are as follows: </para>

          <para class="block">The repayable interest-bearing advances will, as circumstances dictate, be made either from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or the Loan Fund and on the terms and conditions set out in the 1973-1974 Housing Agreement. Provision is made for any payments out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for this purpose to be reimbursed in due course from the Loan Fund, when the Treasurer considers this appropriate. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para>- I support the Opposition&#39;s action in relation to these Bills. Like other members of the Opposition, I certainly consider the course which we have taken in this affair to be the right one. I believe that we have made the right decision. I intend to stick by it. I would like that message to get through to my colleagues on the other side of the Senate, particularly those from Queensland. There is no doubt in the world, despite all the propaganda and all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> might say, that the Senate has the power to act in the way it has acted. Despite all the propaganda and all the insisting by members of the Government Party and others that the Senate did not have that right, there is no doubt that most of them, including the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> have had to admit that the Senate has the right to reject a money Bill. We must consider the position of the Senate as a House of this Parliament. It may be all right for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland to say, as I remember him saying yesterday, that the Senate is not a democratically elected House; but it is a democratically elected House. It is here to protect the rights of the smaller States. It may be all right for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland who comes from New South Wales, which in conjunction with Victoria has more representatives in the other House than all the other States combined, to speak in the way that he did yesterday. New South Wales and Victoria can dominate the House of Representatives, against the interests of the other, smaller States. That is why we have the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Senate- to protect the interests of the smaller States. I, for one, coming from Queensland, will ensure that the wishes of the people of Queensland are put in this place. </para>
        <para>It is ridiculous to talk about conventions. Why did the founding fathers- after all, the rights of the States and how the Senate would be constructed were the biggest issues before Federationgive this power to the Senate? What is the use of giving power to the Senate and then saying that it cannot be used, that by tradition we have got to do something else? The Senate was given the right to protect the interests of the smaller States, in the event of the larger States, which dominate the other House, doing something which is not in the interests of the people of the nation as a whole. If that safeguard was not vested in this House we may not have had a federation as we see it today; we may not have had one country. We may have had our 6 States, as they have in Europe or South America. In those places the people of the same ethnic background live in separate countries. </para>
        <para>As far as I a:m concerned, the Opposition in the Senate has considered this matter. Maybe it is an unusual step to take. Maybe it has not happened before, but I submit that never before in the history of this nation has there been a situation of the Opposition having the numbers in this chamber and of the nation&#39;s affairs being in control of a government which has lost the confidence of the people. It is for us to judge in the interests of the people whether we should force this Government to go to its masters, the people. </para>

            <para>-The honourable senator can make his speech later, or, if he has already done so, he may like to reconsider the matter. There is no doubt that we have that right. The decision was made in the light of the public outcry against this Government&#39;s mismanagement of the affairs of the nation and the public demand that it should be given a say as to whether we continue along the road to socialism, whether private industry is to be driven to the wall, or whether we are going to get back to the prosperity that we had for 20-odd years under previous governments. I believe that we on this side of the chamber have the responsibility to see that the wishes of the people, as transmitted to us, are carried out. I believe that we have to take action when we see the widespread unemployment and inflation which the Government has allowed to continue without making any apparent attempt to curb it. Also we have seen the dealings in relation to the loans affair. Acting Prime Ministers of this country have been sacked. All of these things show that the Government is incapable of running this country. What is the brawl about at the moment? Is it true that we are doing the wrong thing in the Senate, as most people on the Government side are trying to put over, or is the propaganda which is coming from the Government side merely an attempt by it to try to stay in power at any cost? </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I submit that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack said here yesterday is probably the essence of the whole thing: This is a fight between the Parliament and the divine right of a Prime Minister who wants to govern at all costs. There was no problem in 1974 when we suggested that the Government of the day should go to the people. In fact, we have heard all the comments that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> made on that occasion.  His  advice to the Governor-General at that time suggested that he agreed that if he was refused Supply he was duty bound to go to the people. Of course, now it is a different story. The Prime Minister has been doggedly followed by all members on the Government side. He seems to have whipped them into a state of submission in which they will do anything that he wants them to do. Acting Prime Ministers and  Deputy  Prime Ministers have been sacked at his whim. Two of them were sacked because of their association with the loans affair. </para>
        <para>From an examination of the Loans Council minute one can discover that of the 4 Ministers who contrived that great loan raising operation only one survives. One wonders just exactly what this great loan for $2,000m- we have heard it raised to $4,000m and I have heard mention of $8,000m and $9,000m-was all about. That minute was initiated a few days after the anniversary of Pearl Harbour when the Labor Party was slaughtered in Queensland at a State election. Naturally being terrified not only of the polls but also the judgment on this Government by the people of Queensland, I believe that the Government decided that its time looked like being up or, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> said yesterday, its chips were up. The Government wanted to get any money at any cost to obviate the situation which exists today. I wonder what would be the situation today had it raised this sum of $8,000m for temporary purposes on 20-year terms. I wonder what would be the situation if the Government had that money available or invested somewhere. It may have been able to obviate the money problems that it has at the moment or the one that it will have from 30 November until next April and so obviate the constitutional situation and stay in government at all costs. </para>
        <para>We have heard a lot of discussion also about the monetary situation. People have been threatened that they will not get paid. Servicemen, public servants and all sorts of organisations which are due money and which should have received the money appropriated by us last April have been threatened. They should have received that money, but they are not getting it, and we are getting the blame. What has happened to this Government? What is it hiding? It was given an appropriation earlier in the year which was meant to see it through until 30 November. It appropriated something like 49.3 per cent more than it received last year under Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and 110 per cent more under Appropriation Bill (No. 2). Surely that should have given the Government sufficient money to last it not only until 30 November but probably a bit longer. I do not know whether it has run out of money early or whether it has spent it all. I know the manner in which it has been squandering money all over the place. We know also that the check which was carried out the other day revealed that 30 per cent of those receiving the unemployment benefit were not entitled to it. So we do not know where the money is being wasted, but we do know that that is one area in which it has been wasted. </para>

            <para>- I am not saying who is in the racket; they should not be in the racket. That is the area in which the money is being wasted. So why all the threats? Is it a fact that the Government has overspent or the departments have overspent and mismanaged the affairs of the nation? Is the Government trying to hide that fact, or does it have the money to keep it going until 30 November? That is what we would like to know. Why is there all this shilly-shallying about the Government not being able to provide in a certain area money which was due before 30 November, even though it agreed to do so? These are the questions we would like answered. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator knows what happened on 7 December last year; he is well aware of that. If the system of one vote one value was operating at that election the Labor Party would not have one member in the Queensland Parliament. Anyway, let me return to the reasons why we believe that we should continue with our present attitude in relation to this matter. As far as I am concerned, we have a Prime Minister who is determined to stay in office. He could not give a damn what happens to the nation. He has done nothing about inflation and unemployment. What has he done about the private sector which employs 75 per cent of the people of this nation? The Government only has to boost the private sector, give it confidence and allow it to operate in order to solve many of its unemployment problems. But, of course, it does not do that. What has the Government done to the rural sector? Costs have accelerated to such an extent in the country towns, particularly in my own State of Queensland- I have no doubt that the same situation applies in other country towns- that the people are finding it darned difficult to live. The industries in those towns depend on world markets and receive their incomes from a world market situation, but they are faced with a local cost situation that they cannot surmount. Of course, some industries are in the position where they are not making great profits. In fact, most industries are in this position; except perhaps the wheat industry, but even the wheat industry is getting itself into the situation where it could cost itself out of the world markets. The people who are suffering most as a result of the attitude of this Government towards the rural sector are the people who live in country towns because their cost of living is increasing enormously and the industries which support them are not viable enough to provide sufficient work. </para>

        <para>One has to look only at what the removal of the petroleum subsidy has done in my State of Queensland, anyway, and at the price of petrol in the western areas of the State. Increased telephone and postal charges have placed a terrific burden on the people in that area. Oil prices have increased. Everything is added to the cost of transport, which increases considerably the cost of goods. I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> to go to that area in the central west of Queensland and see the difference in the cost of living there now compared with what it was 12 months ago. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Georges</inline>should go and look and see what has happened in that area in 12 months. The people in that area have tried to survive. They are getting to the position where their standard of living is being considerably reduced. The working people in that area have most of their assets tied up in their homes. They cannot sell those homes even for the price that they may have paid for them 10 or 15 years ago. With today&#39;s inflation, these people canno t get back what it cost them to build their homes. There is just no market for their homes. Nobody wants to stay in that area. Many people are leaving. I believe that this is one of the tragedies. People who have lived in this area and have put all their money into their homes have had to go elsewhere to get jobs and they cannot sell their homes. They have to go and put a deposit on new homes or rent homes in areas where job opportunities exist. I believe that I would be doing the wrong thing in this place if I did not vote to defer Supply until such time as this Government is prepared to go to the people. Therefore, I support the stand that has been taken by the Opposition. </para>

It would appear to me to be just another move by that Premier to close down the House of the people in that State and to spend his time agitating and working against this Government in Canberra which is attempting to do something for the people of that State. Because the Premier has been spending so much time vilifying and fighting Canberra, maybe he has not had time to draw up any Bills to present to his Parliament; so he has been forced to close the Parliament down. </para>

        <para>We are dealing with a message from the other place in regard to Appropriation Bills (No. 1) and (No. 2). Quite frankly, the whole exercise has become one of very tedious repetition. Of course, that has been brought about, as we and the taxpayers and residents of this country know, because of the obstructionism of the Opposition in this chamber. It has come about despite the earlier assertion by the Leader of the Liberal Party when he came to the throne of that Party that obstructionism would not be carried on for its own sake. I believe that the whole exercise has been very aptly described in one of the best analogies that I have seen. My colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> would appreciate this because I know that he has been through the same school of life as I went through. This exercise was summed up by a journalist who referred to the Opposition members as being very much akin to a pack of farm dogs around a. heap of wood looking for reprehensible circumstances- as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> has been looking for them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> and other honourable senators of our generation would appreciate that all too often that heap of wood turns out to be covering either a field mouse or a fighting tom cat. Of course, if the tom cat comes out the pack of farm dogs is scatttered to the 4 winds. </para>
        <para>I predict that in this case the heap of wood in which the Leader of the Opposition is looking for reprehensible circumstances has already spewed forth a fighting tom cat. That fighting tom cat is to be found in the 70 per cent of the Australian people who were polled who have said to the Leader of the Opposition: &#39;Pass Supply&#39;. Of course, if he does not pass Supply he will be like that pack of farm dogs; he will be scattered to the 4-winds. The result of the poll which was published in this morning&#39;s newspaper showing that 70 per cent of the people polled were in favour of passing Supply is a fair indication, I think, of what the electors are starting to feel and to express about the Opposition&#39;s obstructionthe opposition by the Liberal and Country Parties. Quite frankly, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> does not make a decision very shortly I predict that he will be slaughtered, that as the heir apparent to the  R.  G. Menzies empire, he will go to the wall. Even the Press has turned on him. The editions of the Age, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> that I have read today have all said: &#39;Pass Supply&#39;. </para>
        <para>It may also be fitting to mention that I understand, early next month, the National Trust in the western district of Victoria is declaring an open day at the home of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> Nareen. Anybody who has been to Nareen or has passed it would appreciate that it is a home of some historical consequence, as are many of the artefacts inside it. So I say to members of the Opposition that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> will be very well catered for early in November- he will have an historic home to go to. I suggest that some other members of the Opposition might have a look over their shoulders to see where they are going to go, unless they use a little bit more prudence than they have used to date in regard to their continued objections to the Appropriation Bills. </para>
        <para>Since 1972 the Labor Government has moved into areas of need that were long neglected by our predecessors as the government. To name three or four of those areas, I refer to Medibank, family law, legal aid and the Children&#39;s Commission. They are areas of need, as I have said, that were neglected for 23 years. </para>

I pointed out that, in relation to the reforms which the Labor Government had promoted since 1972, the Prime Minister had said, amongst other things:  lt is not achieved by spending more money, though money is certainly needed. It requires new institutions, new scales and priorities, new social attitudes, new political guidelines, new efforts at co-operation, new men and women in positions of authority. This process can be difficult and painfully protracted, but eventually the results will show. </para>

        <para class="block">Despite the attempts of this Government to carry out these reforms in much needed areas, the conservatives and reactionaries both in this place and outside, some of them even at the top echelon of State governments, have resisted by every means they can think of the implementation of these reforms. They have resisted them to the bitter end, in many instances even taking the matters as far as High Court decisions. One consequently asks oneself: Why? Why the bitter and sometimes twisted reaction to legislation designed to assist the great mass of people out in the electorate? Why do these people opposite and their stooges in other places believe that they and they alone are born to rule, that they know best? Why do they wish to deny the common people the benefit of Labor&#39;s legislation? It is patently obvious to me that these people believe in a class system. They believe that only the better off classes have the right to proper legal representation before the courts, proper medical and hospital treatment and benefits, that only their children should have the right of access to pre-school care and kindergartens, that only the wealthy classes should have those benefits and that only the wealthy classes should have the benefit of the best education that this country can afford. </para>
        <para>Of course, they still cannot stomach the fact that they are in Opposition. That is becoming more and more obvious every day. We on this side of the House hoped that the Opposition would get over that hangup and after perhaps twelve or eighteen months in Opposition would suddenly realise that it was in Opposition and no longer the Government. But that does not seem to have become a fact. The Opposition still hangs onto the myth that it is the Government. There have been the convention breaking exercises of the State governments, particularly the one in Queensland, which had the audacity in its convention breaking exercise to appoint a nonLabor member to this Parliament over the body of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner.</inline> I believe that that was not so much a mischievous act as a coolly calculated manoeuvre to get control of the numbers in this place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> ill-tempered attack on a High Court judge, I believe, was no accident. It was a deliberate plan to attempt to downgrade the status of the High Court because a few days previously the High Court had handed down several decisions in favour of legislation that this Government had put before the Parliament over the last couple of years. There is the question of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> &#39;s presence in the country at this time. As I said before, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> is the rabbit in the wood pile that the pack of dogs was hoping to find, but it is patently obvious that the rabbit has either gone up a hollow log or underground and the tom-cat, in the form of an irate public, has come out and scattered the pack.

        <para>Power, and power at any price, is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser&#39;s</inline> motto. He seems to see himself as a latter day Messiah moulded in the Menzies pattern. Convention and constitution can be disregarded so far as he is concerned. In Chile and other countries around the world his ilk have used the CIA and guns to overthrow democratically elected governments. The Opposition is not quite yet at the point where it can do that in Australia. It would like to see this Government overthrown, a government which has been popularly elected twice within 3 years and given a mandate. Unfortunately for the Opposition, the mass of Australian people outside are stirred. They are the tom-cat in the woodheap and they will not stand by and see this Government overthrown by jackboot tactics. I believe that the Australian people, in keeping with a long history that seems to be part of our culture, will not bow down to jackboot-type leadership from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony.</inline> I predict that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> will go the way of many previous Liberal leaders.

        <para>I do not wish to say any more, except to repeat what I said earlier. The whole debate on the Appropriation Bills has become tedious repetition. Unfortunately for each and every one of us in this place, the whole institute of Parliament is being downgraded while this wrangle goes on. The sooner some of the more liberal members in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser&#39;s</inline> Party stand up to him and say: &#39;This far, no further&#39;, the sooner democracy will be allowed to go on and the Government to get down to the job, the economy to be brought back into its proper perspective and the Australian people to see the further results of Labor legislation flow. </para>

          <para>- This debate has been rather tedious because this is the third time that the Senate has dealt with the matter. I think it is pretty important that we get back to basic issues with respect to the question of the Appropriation Bills and the course of action which has been taken by the Opposition. It seems quite clear that many red herrings have been drawn across the path of the electorate in this general matter. The Opposition has established quite clearly that there is no constitutional argument at all about this. The Senate has every right to defer the Budget, as it is doing at the present time. The Senate has the right to reject any Bills. There have been precedents in the past to which honourable senators on this side have referred, and in this course of action the Opposition has interesting company. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and the then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy, advocated the throwing out of a Liberal-Country Party Budget, and in fact pursued that course by voting against the Budget in the House of Representatives and by voting against the same measure in this chamber. Had it not been for the fact that a few Australian Democratic Labour Party senators did not agree with their course of action, undoubtedly the Leader of the Liberal-Country Party Government at that time would have had to go to the GovernorGeneral&#39;s residence and resign. Of course, this is precisely what the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> ought to do. </para>

            <para>- I hope he does. Let me also make this point: Not only did the Australian Labor Party vote against the Budget in 1 970, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Gorton suggested on the television program <inline font-style="italic">Federal File</inline> in September 1973 that this was a proper course for a Senate to take if the government was running the country as badly as this Government undoubtedly is. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> is another interesting companion whom we have in this strategy. In July he suggested very clearly to the Senate that if he were the Opposition he would adjourn the Senate until 1 January 1976 and let the people decide the matter. That provides clear evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> political acrobatics, because he is now adopting an entirely different attitude. </para>

        <para>I want to take honourable senators back to the reason why this whole episode started. I have been consistent in what I believe to be correct. We have to go back to the enforced resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor.</inline> This completely destroyed the credibility of the Government in my eyes. It destroyed the credibility of the Prime Minister because I suspect very strongly that he knew about this whole business. As the managing director of Australia, surely he knows or ought to know what his other directors are doing. If he did not, he should resign because he is incompetent. That really destroyed his credibility in my eyes, and that is why I have given my support to deferral of these measures in order to present to the Prime Minister the opportunity to go to Government House, hand in his resignation and ask for a double dissolution. </para>

            <para>- I cannot tell what is in the mind of the Prime Minister. Anyone who could read his mind would be a complete genius, in my opinion, because he changes his mind so often. He has become known throughout Australia as a man who breaks promises, as a man who has encouraged his Party to plunge the nation into a situation in which we have unusually highalmost record high- unemployment. Certainly, the Government has created inflation that has caused distress to many sections of our community. References were made earlier to the pensioners. 1 am certain that the pensioners are not too happy about the grocery bills which they have to pay now and which increase month by month under the influence of this Government&#39;s mismanagement. 1 believe that the Government is employing scare and intimidation tactics throughout Australia. 1 wish to point to just one or two areas in which this has been brought to my attention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> referred to the employees of some government departments being told that their wages will not be paid after the next pay. In fact, in Adelaide the Department of Administrative Services has informed members of its staff there that that is the case; that is, that the Department will have only $23 left after the next pay. This clearly indicates to me the inefficiency and mismanagement of the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly).</inline> I have assured my secretary that if that is the case she will receive my cheque to ensure that her pay is guaranteed. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Let me cite another example: A young woman telephoned me the other day. She was greatly disturbed because she had been informed that her husband would not receive any more money after the next pay and that 10 000 people were in danger of losing their jobs in the department concerned. She tried to contact <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan,</inline> the Premier of South Australia. She told me that she had tried again and again to get in touch with him but he was not available. She ultimately contacted the home of the new Attorney-General in South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duncan.</inline> I am afraid that he was not home, but his wife said that it was quite true. She said that the department would not have any more money and that this woman&#39;s husband was likely to lose his job. This was the inference that came through. She suggested that this lady ought to gather together all the other wives who were being intimidated in this way and demonstrate against Opposition senators. That is the sort of scaremongering tactics that are being employed by the Australian Labor Party. </para>
        <para>Another thing that disturbs me particularly is that there are some members of the Government Party who have been running around Australia suggesting- they have been suggesting it even in the Parliament- that violence could occur. Only the other day I read a report of an address delivered by the honourable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wallis)</inline> to a gathering of railway workers during a lunchtime meeting. He suggested that violence would follow what is happening in Canberra. He suggested that it could reach the stage, as in overseas countries, at which senators could be killed in order to alter the balance of power. That is very amusing! I see that it tickles <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren&#39;s</inline> fancy. This is an example of the irresponsible actions that are being taken by honourable senators opposite. This certainly could encourage a violent minority into a violent demonstration at some time in the future. That, in my opinion, is irresponsible in the extreme. </para>
        <para>Let me return to dealing with the inefficiency of this Government. I could talk for an hour in listing what this Government has done to the people of Australia. It has created high interest rates. It has created in Australia a situation in which young people are unable to afford to build a home. <inline font-style="italic">{Honourable senators interjecting)</inline></para>

Supply is guaranteed until 30 November. There is no reason why the departments cannot proceed until that time. I asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> only a day or two ago whether it was a fact that earlier in the year the Senate passed Supply Bills to guarantee Supply for a 5-month period ending on 30 November. I also asked him whether it was a fact that the amount to be expended under one Supply Bill- I am speaking from memory- was 49 per cent more, perhaps even more than that, than last year and that the other Bill provided for 1 10 per cent more expenditure than was guaranteed to the Government last year. I do not think there is any excuse for any department to be without money at the present time or until the end of the month&#39; of November. I suggest that the honourable senators opposite discontinue these scaremongering tactics that they have been employing over the last 3 weeks. </para>

I think the remarks attributable to the Honourable D. J. Killen, MP, have been mentioned before in this debate- but then there is very little that has not been mentioned before and I think this should be mentioned again. I refer to the remarks he was reported, in the <inline font-style="italic">National Times</inline> in February 1972, as having made. This was at a time when &#39;convention&#39; was still a word that was allowable in this place. He said: </para>

          <para>Views on tha-, issue remain unsettled. But the really remarkable part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser&#39;s</inline> speech lay in his criticism of an incident that took place eight months before his resignation. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Evidently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> was not as indignant about conventions in. those days as he is now. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Killen</inline> continues: </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline>further claimed that he knew nothing of the plan until July 14, and that the plan had not been approved of by the Cabinet. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline>himself admitted that the Cabinet did meet on July 19, - </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That was 5 days later-  and he, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> signed the call-out order . . . If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> had felt aggrieved by any action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> regarding the call-out order, then he should have promptly resigned. He chose not to. He let eight months go by before voicing his complaint ... <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> chose to ignore a fundamental convention of government. The cosmetic of time may or may not hide the blemish. </para>
        <para class="block">That was not said by members of this Government but by one of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser&#39;s</inline> colleagues. So much for this Opposition of integrity; so much for this Opposition that talks about an incompetent government. The Opposition talks about credibility. The greed for power seems to have slightly changed its members&#39; way of thinking. We hear all the waffling in the world against a man like the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)-</inline> a man of high purpose and vision- from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> whose integrity was displayed in 1972. It makes one wonder why these people in the Opposition are so anxious to get back into the saddle and why they are so anxious to get back the power that they misused for 23 years. I have a feeling it is not because they want to help the lower income earners or the large mass of Australian people. </para>
        <para>We only have to go back to the opposition they put up against schemes like Medibank to have our question answered and to know why they want to be back in the saddle. We only have to go back and look at their record in education and at the valiant fight they put up to return to that system of education whereby the privileged were educated and the un-privileged were used as factory fodder. We remember their fight against the Trade Practices Act. Then we remember the people who pay the bills when it comes to election time and we know why they want to remove such legislation as the Trade Practices Act. At the moment the Legal Aid Bill is on its way. We know from surveys that have been taken how many people in Australia want a Bill such as the Legal Aid Bill. We know that something like 89 per cent of Liberal voters and 92 per cent of Labor voters were in favour of the legislation. We remember also that something like 84 per cent of the people who had never heard of our proposal for legal aid said, when the proposal was put to them, that if there was one thing that was needed to bring justice to the ordinary people of Australia it was the Legal Aid Bill. </para>
        <para>We remember the things that this Government has done for women and children. For 23 years women and children were forgotten people in Australia. They were used as cheap labour. Children were parked in all sorts of places. Nobody really gave a damn whether children had rights or were treated as human beings. This Government has come in and given women, as people, rights and dignity. We have given women and workers some hope that they may be able to go about their daily tasks with some peace of mind as to how the children- our dearest possessionswill be looked after while the women work for a living, in the main, and for so me while they work to give their expertise to this country. We look at the migrants to whom we finally brought dignity, decency and recognition. </para>
        <para>Then we wonder where are all these people who the Opposition tells us are demanding that we have an election? They certainly are not the 1 8 year olds who were denied a vote by this Opposition for 23 years but who the Opposition was very happy to send out to fight its wars. It was not until this Government came into power that these people were given a vote and a responsibility in the country. The ethnic communities certainly are not demanding that we have an election. They have come out in their thousands and demanded that this Government be allowed to govern and that Supply be allowed to go through. The Aborigines are not demanding an election. They have demonstrated in most of the capital cities in Australia that they want this Government to be given a chance to put its policies into practice. The old age pensioner organisations have declared that they want this Government to continue; that they recognise that in the short period this Government has been in office the wants of old age pensioners have been recognised; and that rather than being given a kiss on the cheek and a 50c rise every 12 months they have been treated as people. </para>
        <para>The Opposition would have us believe that the unions are at loggerheads with this Government. But be they blue collar or white collar unions, their members have come out in their thousands during the last 2 weeks and have maintained that the Government that they voted for in 1972 and 1 974 was the Government that represented them and the Government that they wanted to continue. Thousands of people have been in the streets over this issue during the last couple of weeks. If there has been one surprise in this whole affair it has been that ordinary people have understood this constitutional crisis- no matter how much the Opposition tells us it is not a constitutional crisis, it is- and have taken the matter to heart. They have had the guts to come out in the street and to say: &#39;We do not want this Government to be put out on this issue. We want it to continue its normal term&#39;. Leading constitutional lawyers in Australia have come out and said that the conventions that go with the Constitution should be observed. </para>
        <para>There have been letters to the editor which were overwhelmingly in support of this Government. One has to admit that newspapers have not always been on the side of this Government so one can hardly say that the editors of all the big daily newspapers would have managed that in some way. The business community is now coming out and saying that the Appropriation Bills should be passed. The business community here in Canberra is saying that because the Senate has rejected the Budget- those are their words, not mine- their businesses are being affected and that the whole tenor of the business community is being upset. Hundreds of letters and telegrams have been received from ordinary people who have taken the trouble to sit down and write to one of us on this side of the House or on the other side of the House to say that they do not like what is going on. They do not like the possibilities that they can see. They want the Senate to act as an adult body. Today we have Liberal voters saying much the same thing. In the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of this morning there is an article on a survey which states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>While an overwhelming majority of Labor voters think the Senate should allow Supply to pass, a significant minority of those who said they voted Liberal at the 1974 elections (41 per cent) also share this view. </para>
          <para>Nearly 17 per cent of previous Liberal voters also think the Labor Government should be allowed to continue governing. </para>

It is a strange thing that men, whose only thing they have to sell is their labour, and who go on strike for decent wages or conditions are vilified by honourable senators opposite for holding up the country and the whole manufacturing industry to ransom. Yet when people like members of the Opposition in the Senate or members of the Australian Medical Association go on strike, somehow they are thought to be heroes. Honourable senators opposite will not take the step. They are like kids playing cricket; they will not go out. They will not change the rules and they will not abandon the match. They just take their bat and go home, leaving the rest of the teams standing on the field. </para>

        <para>The Opposition will not amend the Budget. It will not refuse to pass the Budget. It admits that it is a good Budget because it says: &#39;When you have submitted to our blackmail, then we will pass the Budget&#39;. Obviously the Opposition has no objection to the Budget. It just goes on strike. Until the Opposition gets its own way, it will not play. But it has no alternative. This country expects members of the Senate to act like adult senators, like people who have been put into the Senate to represent the people and to govern the country. Honourable senators are not expected to act like spoilt children who want their lollipops returned to them. Perhaps some honourable senators do not have the courage to take the step. But why do they not act like men and at least reject the Budget? I suggest they do something positive. Why do they not amend? It is because they have no policy. They do not know what to amend or what to do. That is why we cannot have honourable senators opposite as the government of this country. We cannot take the risk of what they would do to this country. In closing I shall read yet another quotation from a member of the Opposition, it states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>There are many challenges to the preservation of Parliament. There are forces within our community, some of great power, that do not believe in Parliamentary government. There are economic and social problems which the Parliament has not yet been able to solve. These problems alone would be daunting for present legislators and Ministers. If we add to that list the problems created by the behaviour of Parliament itself, the destruction of convention, the defiance of reason, the pursuit of power without concern for the rights or privileges of minorities, then Australians will have little faith in the future of Australian democracy. </para>

          <para>- Some 2 weeks ago the Senate voted to defer the 2 Appropriation Bills pending the dissolution of the lower House by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> This is the traditional constitutional practice in order to bring about an election. In effect, the Opposition is saying that the people through &#39; the ballot box should make a judgment on the Whitlam Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> said that she could find no one in Australia who either supports the Senate Opposition in its present action or who opposes the Whitlam Government because of its policies. If that is so, that is an admirable atmosphere for the Whitlam Government to take its courage in its hands and test itself at the ballot box. If the Government believes, as the honourable senator has said, that nobody is against the Whitlam Government- she went on and on about this - let the Government take its courage in its hands, as is the constitutional practice, and go to the people. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I quote a statement which the honourable senator made: &#39;We remember the things that this Government has done for women and children&#39;. That remark ought to be on a political tombstone for this Government. We will remember those things. That is what this deferral is all about. We remember that when we left office we had the most sustained full employment for 20 years of any country in the industrial world. One million, two hundred and fifty thousand married women were in sustained full employment on real wages with real purchasing power. What has this Government done for the women and children? I will tell honourable senators what it has done. It has put hundreds of thousands of them out of employment. Is this a proud record? Do honourable senators opposite want me to mention what has happened in the textile, footwear, clothing and electronics industries? Do they want me to state it in terms of women and unemployment? Honourable senators opposite know that this is on record. This is what the so-called Whitlam Government has done for women. </para>
        <para>Now what does it intend to do for the children? On the admission of the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> it will create in the coming 2 months some 200 000 more unemployed by its sheer failure to employ school and college leavers. Yet the Government tells us what it has done for the women and children of Australia. In <inline font-style="italic">2lh</inline> years the Government has wrecked this country. Three years ago this country could stand up and say, quoting the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Monetary Fund, that Australia has had the highest sustained employment of any industrialised country for more than 20 years. It could stand up and say, again quoting both those authorities, that this country has had the lowest sustained inflation rate of any industrialised country, averaging 2.5 per cent over 20 years. It has had the lowest inflation rate and the highest sustained employment. It could also say, again quoting those international authorities, that it had the highest home ownership of any country and therefore the greatest distribution of wealth. It could quote Professor Henderson as to the enormous distribution of wealth between rich and poor. It could quote the statistics on the creation of real wealth and its sharing. In the space of <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> years this Government has destroyed all this. Yet it has the gall and humbug to come to us now and say: Remember what we have done for the women and children &#39;. On its own admission there will be half a million people unemployed between December and January. </para>
        <para>I remind the Whitlam Government that twice I have asked it and twice it has responded to the question: What will you do about the unemployment that now exists and the additional unemployment which will be created in November, December, January and February? <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> contains the Government&#39;s answers given by both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> who said: &#39;We will do not one thing more than we have already foreshadowed we will do in this Budget&#39;. That is a calamitous and disgraceful attitude. These are the people who stand up here and say there is nothing wrong with the record of this Government. </para>
        <para>Let me remind the Government why its appropriation Bills deserve deferral and why the </para>
        <para class="block">Government needs reference to the people. When the Treasurer introduced the Appropriation Bills he made 3 main assumptions- they are in the Budget papers- and each of those assumptions has proved to be absolutely wrong in the ensuing 2 months. Therefore, the assumptions in the Budget Speech are today admitted by the Government to be in tatters. In the Budget Speech the Government predicted unemployment at something like 250 000. The ink had hardly dried on the Budget Speech before the Minister for Labor and Immigration in this place announced that there would be 400 000 or more people unemployed in December, January and February. Maybe, he said, it would get back to 300 000 by June. </para>
        <para>There was a complete deception of the people. The whole framework of the Budget rested on one assumption and it is found in the opening phases of the Budget where the Treasurer said: If we had continued to spend at the same record rate as last year we would have ended up with a Budget deficit somewhat double the record deficit of last year&#39;. In other words, what he was saying was that the Budget deficit of $2, 500m- oddly enough estimated at $570m- would have doubled to some $5,000m. The Treasurer then went on to say in most graphic words that, should the deficit get beyond the $2, 790m predicated in the Budget, economic chaos would occur in this country. He talked of massive unemployment and hyper-inflation in his Budget Speech. Since then the Treasurer day by day has had to admit that the Budget is in ruins, that the costing of it was wrong because item after item was costed on a pre-30 June 1975 basis with no allowance whatever for the cost increases in the year ahead; for example, cost increases of the order of 23 per cent in respect of wages for which there is no allowance at all except in the Treasurer&#39;s Advance. We will see how Treasurer&#39;s Advances will take up the slack because if they do take up the slack this Government will have money with which to operate until Christmas under its Supply Bills. The Treasurer&#39;s Advances made under 2 Supply Bills passed in this Senate in May collectively contain $240m of extra money which would fund the Government in the weeks ahead. </para>
        <para>However, what has the Government said now? It has said that the deficit may reach $3, 500m because &#39;perhaps we over-estimated the intake by way of taxation&#39;. Have a look at today&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review,</inline> at today&#39;s newspapers and at the so-called Neimeyer statement for the quarter ended 30 September and honourable senators will find a Budget deficit at this moment running at the order of $ 1 ,800m. It is true that we cannot accurately extrapolate a projection based on this period but, taking into account the shortfall in taxation, the deliberate under-costing of wages, overtime, telephone charges, postage charges, rent and building costs, the Budget deficit must be running at least at $4,000m or more. Therefore, by its own bench-mark this Government stands convicted. It said that the Budget would, be in ruins if this happened. The Government therefore has presented to us a Budget in ruins and it plaintively asks why we have acted to defer it. </para>
        <para>Day by day more and more information comes out, not only about the most massive economic chaos and mismanagement that anybody has seen in Australia since Federation but also about dishonesty, deception and even corruption in government. This Government admits to no principles at all. It admits to no precedents in the way that it governs. </para>
        <para>I want to dwell on one major matter which has not been given sufficient public spotlight. I allude to the very belated admission by the Treasurer that he had allowed the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to have recourse to all the Budget documents some 7 hours before the Budget was presented in this place. After being pressed the Treasurer confessed that he was not locked up like members of the Press or put under security until 8 o&#39;clock, and the Treasurer gave a number of tests. I want to look at these tests by using the Labor Party&#39;s own bench-mark once again because surely the best thing to do is to ask the Government about it. I looked at comments that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> made when as  President  of the ACTU he accepted the presidency of the Australian Labor Party. People said to him: &#39;Surely in doing these 2 things- with, on the one hand, your industrial commitment to the trade union movement as  President  of the ACTU and, on the other, your presidency of the Australian Labor Party- there will be a conflict of interest&#39;. He said: &#39;Oh, no, there will be no conflict of interest; none at all&#39;. </para>
        <para>So we start off with one clear thing, that is, that what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> is doing as  President  of the ACTU and what he is doing as  President  of the Australian Labor Party are identical in their interests. That is what he said, not I. That is interesting because I understand that the Labor Party has strict rules that unless a person obeys the decisions of the Labor Party he can be expelled from the Party, which is a practice that occurs quite frequently. So at 1 p.m. on that day, ahead of any other person- ahead, I imagine, of many Ministers of the Whitlam Cabinet- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline></para>
        <para class="block">Hawke was given access to the Budget Papers. That access was accorded to him as  President  of the Australian Labor Party as well as  President  of the ACTU because there is an identity of interest, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> has said and said repeatedly in this regard. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline>and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> have said that the primary test is that he is a man of integrity. Let us apply that. Does it mean that any person of integrity can have open access to the Budget Papers 7 hours before the Budget is released? Adopting that test, why should <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> be judged in terms of his honour, his morality and his integrity any more or less than any other Australian? What absolute arrogance and impertinence it is for the Whitlam Government to put the  President  of the Labor Party above any other Australian, whoever he may be, in terms of morality and integrity. Why should he be placed above even the most simple person in the street? It is, of course, the very arrogance of the Labor Party that has done this, but he has been placed there. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline>has also said: &#39;Of course, you know, he is in a special situation. He is a member of the Board of the Reserve Bank of Australia and that, of course, allows him access to secrets. That is a reason.&#39; The only trouble with that, the defect with that, is that here again we have some problems because nobody else who is a member of the Board of the Reserve Bank is given any access to the Budget Papers. I remind honourable senators that it is on record from the Governor of the Reserve Bank, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Knight,</inline> who is a highly respected man, that members of the Reserve Bank would not receive Budget documents and would not necessarily be in receipt of Budget documents by virtue of their office. Of course they would not. Anyone who knows the practice that has been followed knows that this has never happened before. </para>
        <para>I thought that perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> might be of help to me. So I looked to what he has said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>For years <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> has regularly participated in television programs on the Budget on Budget night and he takes part in these discussions with journalists who have seen copies of the Budget in advance. Quite obviously it is better for him to be equally well briefed, and he has been, and quite properly. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">So the test that the Prime Minister puts is that if one takes part in television programs on the Budget on Budget night one is entitled to be well briefed beforehand. &#39;So come along chaps and we will give you the documents 7 hours beforehand&#39;. Were any of the dozens and dozens of people in the community who do in fact take part in these programs invited to see these documents beforehand? Not at all. Did the Budget not have a major impact on manufacturing? Was there a more important section of the community from which to seek support for this Budget than the manufacturing industry? Where was the main thrust wanted? Surely from the people we would inspire to create more jobs, to increase production, to take up more employment, to create greater output and to create greater wealth. Was any member of the manufacturing industry given this particular insight? Of course not. Was the retail trade, which is always a major commentator on Budget night, invited? Is it not interested in what happens to the excise on beer, cigarettes, tobacco and spirits? Are the service station proprietors, the petroleum industry, the National Roads and Motorists Association and the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria not interested in an increase in petrol prices? </para>

            <para>- Yes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> quite properly says: &#39;What about the  Chairman  of the Employers Federation?&#39; I have dealt firstly with an ordinary cross section of the people of Australia. The small shopkeepers of Australiawhy, of all people, were they not invited? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> has said: &#39;Oh, but you must understand that there is a very proper reason. We are depending basically for our whole Budget thesis on wage restraint and we wanted to make absolutely sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> would back our policies thoroughly and convincingly immediately after the Budget&#39;. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Let us test that. Of course all of us here are four-square in wanting to back wage restraint. But I remind honourable senators of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> &#39;s test. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> has said: &#39;As  President  of the Federal Labor Party I have no conflict of interest with the ACTU&#39;. I say to honourable senators that, as  President  of the Federal Labor Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> was committed to his back teeth to support whatever was in the Budget because it is Labor Party policy to do so. What nonsense it is to say that he had to be reassured first. What nonsense it is to say that he had to be taken aside first in relation to this matter. </para>
        <para>Let us rest on this business that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> is an honourable man. So are they all honourable men. Let us look at this. Of whom are we talking? We are talking of the  President  of the Federal Labor Party, who is a man of immense partisan interest and therefore of immense motivation in a partisan fashion, and good luck to him, in a cause which I oppose. We are talking of the proprietor, on behalf of the ACTU, of Bourke &#39;s store in Melbourne- a major retail store which traffics in much of the matters that were involved in this Budget. Was the  President  of the Retail Traders Association invited to come along? Were Myers, Farmers or David Jones given an insight into this Budget, a look into this Budget? Why is it that in past Liberal-National Country Party governments only one or two of the main Ministers and not the whole Cabinet were ever told before 8 p.m. on the night of the Budget what was the nature of the customs and excise and sales tax charges? The answer is quite clear. It is because, whether inadvertently or otherwise, the possession of that information in the hands of people some hours beforehand could make or break fortunes. The capacity to buy up stocks of tobacco, cigarettes and spirits is, of course, immense in the time program. Why should the proprietor of Bourke &#39;s store have that information at all? Why should the proprietor of a petroleum marketing organisation in ACTUSolo Enterprises Pty Ltd- the same <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawkehave</inline> inside information? Why should he have it 7 hours beforehand? Why was he, unlike all the others, not locked up until 8 o&#39;clock at night? Why is he a special person? </para>
        <para>The whole history of the Whitlam Government is that it puts itself and its leaders above the law. It is trying now in the present constitutional confrontation to put itself above the law. I say that what happened in the admission of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> to the Budget secrets is one of the most shameful episodes in the Labor Party&#39;s very shameful history in the last two or three years. A fraction of that would have forced the Treasurer of Britain or any other country- Canada, for example- to resign. Similar things have happened, and the Treasurers have resigned. The only reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> has not resigned is that he has not served his statutory 6 months as Treasurer. There is no doubt that he will follow the Creans and the Cairnses because of his inevitable accident-proneness and bedevilment of principles. </para>
        <para>This fact has emerged very belatedly and no doubt because the Treasurer found out that someone knew it and was about to blow it. So the Treasurer made it public himself. There is no doubt at all that the disclosure was made, belatedly, for that reason. If it were a principle on which he wanted to stand, why did he not tell us that he proposed to do it or why did he not tell us the following day that he had done it? I put a simple proposition. The only test, which is really the one on which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> rests, is that he wanted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> &#39;s full support on wage restraint and ordinary wage indexation. The Federal  President  of the ALP is compelled, by his membership of that Party, to full and active supportnothing less. So he did not need to read any documents; he did not need to do anything at all. </para>
        <para>This situation followed hard upon another situation. What is the other situation? It involves the same <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke.</inline> Let me try to think out loud. A certain former Minister for Minerals and Energy said that he approved an arrangement for the purchase of crude oil by ACTU-Solo and was not told what the second half of the arrangement was. I state in simple terms what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> asks us to believe: He knew the price of Australian crude. He knew its resale price on the Australian market. He knew that anyone fortunate enough to have a supply bought at the fixed governmental price could make millions of dollars by selling it on the Australian market, and would do so. He knew that commercial practice would demand that the sale be at a profit. The Government said that he solemnly approved an agreement which, on the face of it, was aimed at an American company selling crude oil to ACTUSolo at cost price; that is, without any profit margin to the company selling the crude oil. For some magic reason this company would be totally altruistic and its actions would be beyond any actions of any other entrepreneur. </para>
        <para>There are a couple of interesting memoranda in the evidence given before the Commission. One officer of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor&#39;s</inline> Department said in a memorandum, if I recall it clearly, that the agreement, on the face of it, looked all right unless there was a secret deal involved. That is on the file. An officer of his Department did the ordinary test and wondered why anyone, in a fit of altruism quite opposed to the interests of the company concerned, its shareholders or owners, would sell something without making a profit. It is of the essence of absolute nonsense. </para>

            <para>- That was an interesting exchange. The Commission made a finding, as I understand it and as I read it, that the ACTUSolo agreement was in fact a deception. Therefore, quite clearly, those who were responsible for the agreement had deceived. There was in fact not one agreement but two; one was concealed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> was and is the leading director of that company. I go one step further. I point out the other improbable. We have been told recently that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> was sacked for misleading the Parliament and the people of Australia. Was it misleading or lying? According to the words used by the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor&#39;s</inline> lying to the Parliament and the people arose out of his allegedly not revealing that arrangements with a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> were continuing. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I put to the Senate, in simple practice, the same test as I put about the ACTU-Solo business. Does anybody in Australia believe that a senior Minister, who had been Acting Prime Minister, persisted with an agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> up to the brink of a decision having to be made, without having in his mind the certain knowledge that at the point when he had brought it to fruition the Prime Minister and the Treasurer would approve the loan? Let me state it another way. Did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> have in his mind that the Prime Minister had revoked the loans authority and was unlikely to agree to the loans? Was that the situation? Are we now saying that under those circumstances <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> pursued intensely a situation in order to get a loan which he knew could never be ratified? Come off it! The condition precedent to a senior Minister negotiating a loan is that when he has it to the point of fruition his Prime Minister and his Treasurer will approve it. What else could anybody believe? What else is the test of credibility? Those are the basic things. </para>
        <para>I come back to the essence of the message from the other place. We are debating a second message sent to us from another place in relation to the Appropriation Bills. In the course of these events the Government has made some very rash statements about the alleged abuse of powers by the Senate. It is extraordinary that Government senators who are elected under the Commonwealth Constitution should set about denying the very powers under which they are elected and from which their responsibilities operate. To rebut the Prime Minister&#39;s statements of the last 2 days, I quote from the Constitution. Section 1 states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives, and which is hereinafter called &#39;The Parliament&#39; or &#39;The Parliament of the Commonwealth&#39;. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">So the Parliament consists of the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Constitution recognises that fundamentally the Senate is an integral part of the legislative power. The opening words of the relevant section are that the legislative power of the Commonwealth is vested in these three: The Queen, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. What the Whitlam Government is trying to distort now is the very nature of this Senate. I want to lay it clearly on the line that the Senate is not based on the Westminster system at all; it is based on the American Congress. The Senate has virtually the same money powers as has the American Congress, and the American Congress is one of the greatest and most respected legislatures in the world. The American people have no regrets about that. I think they would agree that in America the Senate is in fact more powerful and more influential than the lower House. Nobody in America sees that as a defiance of the people. Nobody in Australia should see it as a defiance of the people, because in Australia as in America the Senate is elected on the full general adult franchise of all the Australian people. Indeed, the franchise is more accurate because it is based on proportional representation. So it more truly reflects the precise will of the people at a point in time. </para>
        <para>Those people who understand that will know that built into the Commonwealth structure at Federation was a Senate of a particular structure, with particular powers. Well might every honourable senator recall this: The States would not have a bar of Federation unless there was a Senate which had 2 main characteristics. The first was that it should be equally represented by all the States. By that I mean the smallest State in population should have the same representation as the largest. </para>

            <para>- That is right. In the American Senate 2 senators come from each of the 50 States. The second characteristic is that the Senate should have a concurrent money power with the House of Representatives. Without the concurrent power, of course, all else would fail. If it did not have the money power then the 2 great States in the House of RepresentativesNew South Wales and Victoria- could do 2 quite ugly things. The House of Representatives is forced by the Constitution to exact uniform rates of taxation, on the one hand, but it could, on the other hand, spend all or the great part of its revenue in the 2 great States. Since they had the voting power there, and if they had the power of the purse there, that would clearly happen. If honourable senators support what the Prime Minister said today they must go back to their State- to South Australia, to Tasmania, to Western Australia, to Queensland- and say: &#39;We are going to destroy your money power&#39;because that is what the Prime Minister saysand in destroying your money power we are going to destroy your legislative power&#39;, because the legislative power of a chamber is the money power of a chamber. It is the one way of controlling the direction of policies.  </para>

            <para>- . . . gives to this Senate not j ust a power but a responsibility. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> interjected and said: &#39;Which you are breaking&#39;. The only people who are breaking the Constitution at this moment are those who are breaking the clear constitutional practice that when Supply cannot be established a government resigns. I ask through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy</inline> President: Is that the constitutional practice? I call as witness the Prime Minister of Australia and the documents relating to the double dissolution which were tabled in the Senate yesterday Honourable senators will find by persuasive reading that it is said repeatedly that because the Senate has declined to grant Supply the constitutional practice is that the Prime Minister must go to the Governor-General and seek a double dissolution. In other words, precisely the same situation as we have today the Prime Minister had in May last year. The Prime Minister is on written record, by letters to the GovernorGeneral, saying that it is the constitutional duty of a government denied Supply to go to the Governor-General and get an election. What an extraordinary silence now. If honourable senators opposite want the documents read into the Hansard record we would be delighted to do so in the days and weeks ahead. The fundamental situation is that section 53 of the Constitution gives to the Senate the one responsibility and the one power which enables a government, which is a wrecking government, which is a destructive government, which is a government doing permanent damage to the people, to be brought to the people. </para>

            <para>- I am always grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> He asks whether I read the result of the gallup poll. I did, and I was delighted to learn that if we had had an election on the day on which the Morgan gallup poll was taken the Labor Party would have been wiped out in a landslide, that it would have polled 43 per cent of the vote and that we would have polled 50 per cent plus of the vote. I did read the gallup poll and it said that if people were to vote today they would vote the Labor Party out of office in a landslide. That is what the gallup poll said. In the knowledge that the Opposition had deferred appropriation, the people were asked on 18 October how they would vote, and they said overwhelmingly: &#39;We would wipe out the Labor Party&#39;. So do not let us talk about the gallup poll. I come back to section 53 of the Constitution. </para>

            <para>- My goodness, the hens are broody and clucky this afternoon. They are really moulting this afternoon. Let us see how a wicked Opposition seizes power. I will tell the Senate how it seizes power. It goes to the Australian people and says to the 5 million electors: We are prepared to take your judgment in the ballot box. We are prepared to take your acceptance or rejection of us&#39;. We come now to the second point and to the only other point that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> made in today&#39;s newspaper- that a government must be allowed to run its full term. Why did not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> tell <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan</inline> that recently when he ran early because he was scared stiff that the unpopularity of Whitlam would destroy him if he ran his full term? What kind of nonsense, what kind of humbug is it that says &#39;It is all right for governments to run short term if it is voluntary, it is all right for governments to pick their time at the height of their popularity, but they must nor. be dragged squealing from the tart shop &#39;? As I said the other day, is it not a fact that if 2 people of the Government ranks in the other House died the Government would fall? Where is the provision in this Constitution that says that it does not matter who dies, the Government is to see out its full course? Where is the provision in this document that says that if 2 people cross the floor the Government shall run its full course? It is all right to run voluntarily, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan</inline> does. Honourable senators opposite admit by their silence that governments can be brought down by defection or death. They must admit that because their own </para>

        <para>I commend a little light reading to honourable senators opposite. I commend the papers that were tabled yesterday, because every argument that the Prime Minister and his Government are putting up now is refuted by the letters written, the statements made and the actions taken by the Prime Minister, as demonstrated in those documents. He said to the Governor-General: &#39;If you are denied Supply you must go to the people&#39;. Why is he not saying it today? Can I tell honourable senators? He says in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> today: &#39;But it is different today&#39;. Do honourable senators know what the difference is? He says: &#39;You have not rejected the Appropriation Bills twice. That is why it is different&#39;. Let us have a little bit of rich reward for this. What happened last year? We did not reject the Supply Bills, and we did not reject them twice. We deferred the Supply Bills last year. An identical situation occurred. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> has some 20-odd Bills which have been twice submitted to the Senate and twice rejected by the Senate. He has the absolute authority to go to the Governor-General under section 57. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator McLaren</inline>is a delight and a joy in these times of crisis. He is always helpful when he wants to be. He is saying, by implication, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> was lying when he posed to the Governor-General a submission which was a submission of compulsion last year. Was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> lying when he said that it is the duty of a government denied Supply to go to the electors. Did I hear it stated then &#39;If he wants to&#39;? What a joy! The simple position is that today there is an identical situation. I sum up this way: It is beyond doubt that this Constitution contains not only the power but also the responsibility for the Senate to act as we have done. It has now emerged as a thing of major importance that Labor senators in this chamber have indicated that it is the proposal of their government, supported by them, that they shall set out to weaken and destroy the money power of the Senate. It has now emerged that no small or less populated State can in the future under what has been revealed today feel that it has any safety at all in Canberra. </para>

        <para>My goodness, here is an admission that with a Senate that has no money teeth, all the money can be spent in the 2 big States. So the Labor senators who come from Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland must go back home and say to the people in those States: &#39; We are coming back to tell you that we propose to emasculate the Senate. We propose to take away your voice- the voice of Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania- in the Senate&#39;. I wish them joy in this. Let them bring on this test on the hustings. If they want to do this, let them do so. Here it comes out. The Prime Minister must clearly be looked at in the light of his intentions. He has an absolute obsession against the Senate. How does he see the Senate? He sees it as the one obstacle that gets in his way. He is a man obsessed with power. He is a man who has said in his writings and speeches that he sees all power concentrated in one House, the House of Representatives. He sees the abolition of the Senate, the abolition of the 6 State parliaments, the abolition of municipalities and shires, and all international and national power, to use his words, concentrated in the House of Representatives without the restraint of the Commonwealth Constitution. </para>
        <para>What we are looking at now goes beyond the deception of the Budget, the 500 000 people prospectively to be unemployed, inflation, the lack of housing, the corruption of the Budget itself and its false representation, the ACTUSolo deception, the Hawkes and their special interest briefing in the Budget, the Gairs and the kicking upstairs, the conniving and contriving and the whole sorry affair of the Connors and Cairns. It now becomes an attack on the fundamental Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. It now is revealed as being a bid by the Prime Minister to destroy the powers of the States and to concentrate power in one handhis. Then, by the gerrymandering of boundaries, by the rigging of electoral laws, by firstpastthepost type voting, which is what he stands for, by the destruction of minorities and by the destruction of all that get away from him, to entrench himself. We were asked: What is the justification for deferring these Appropriation Bills? Surely that is a pretty good justification. What is the justification? May we come back to the women and children whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> asked us to remember, to the 500 000 unemployed, to the prospective 150 000 to 200 000 students and school leavers who will not get jobs, to the lack of housing - </para>

          <para>-I wish to begin by conveying to members of the Opposition my extreme sympathy for the dilemma in which they now find themselves. I can understand how distressing that must be to 2 parties which believe they have a perpetual right to power, and which approximately 3 weeks ago launched publicly, after extreme orchestration, the vehicle which they are still attempting to drive to block Supply. I can understand how chagrined they must be that their little plan has misfired. We have seen evidence of that chagrin increasing over the last few days in the extremely disconsolate attitude of members of the Opposition and their known fighting among themselves about the stand that they are taking. They remind me very much of many of the criminals of Britain in the early days of last century and of the highwayman&#39;s case in which the issue simply was this: The gun was produced and the victim was told: &#39;There will be no trouble and no one will get hurt if you just hand over your money&#39;. </para>

            <para>- With the greatest respect, the comment was prefaced by remarks about the behaviour of the Opposition. The honourable senator went on to describe what he had said in Franklin Square and made a reference to not yielding to thugs. Over the last few days there have been a number of occasions when, in the heat of the moment, unparliamentary language was used. In my submission, that word is clearly a description which, if meant to apply to the Opposition, is unparliamentary and should be withdrawn. Alternatively, the honourable senator might like to indicate that he did not intend to apply the word to the members of the Opposition, in which case of course my point of order falls to the ground. </para>

I want to make one or two observations that I think are germane to the matters that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> has raised. It is true that the type of language that has been used in recent weeks is a consequence of the Opposition&#39;s own action in the first place in hurling insults across the chamber day after day, accusing my Party and the Government as a whole in words such as corruption&#39;, &#39;conspiratorial conduct&#39; and &#39;criminal conduct&#39;. If that is the sort of language that emanates from that side of the chamber, then I think it is fair and reasonable that, in defence of the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett</inline> is entitled in the course of his remarks to describe the conduct of the Opposition as outright political blackmail and banditry. </para>

            <para>- I would point out in virtual self defence that these expressions are not used in their literal sense. No one suggests that members of the Opposition are thugs as that expression is understood in the criminal law. They do not go out, so far as I know, and actually bash people. They are not brigands in the sense that they go out and knock people about and steal their money. They are not bandits in the ordinary sense. What I said was surely a permissible use of language by borrowing an expression that is understood and relating it to political conduct. That is all I was doing. But I will assist you by leaving that point because I think it has been clearly established that the Opposition&#39;s behaviour is reprehensible in the extreme. I just put it this way. Three weeks or so ago, after this careful orchestration, the Opposition said: &#39;We will stand this Government up in the Senate. &#39; That is what it decided to do; that is what it has continued to do; and that is the situation in which it must be regretting it finds itself today. It has seen the reaction of the people. Where is the evidence that the people of Australia or any reasonable majority of them require an election? Where is the evidence that a reasonable majority of the people of Australia consider it proper for the Senate to defer consideration of the Budget? I ask the Opposition to produce the evidence. </para>

            <para>- I was in Queensland a month ago. Although the aircraft shuddered a little as it flew across the border, I found in many people a reaction to the attitude of the Opposition in building up towards what it did 3 weeks ago, that would surprise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline> if he moved outside the hierarchical circles. The clear evidence is exactly the opposite of what has been put by the Opposition. There is no groundswell to support what the Opposition is doing; rather, the position is the opposite. </para>

            <para>- I believe that I am an Australian. 1 do not strut around sticking out my chest. I prefer to be called an Australian first and a Tasmanian second. So far as I am concerned, in the situation that confronts the Senate there is no democratic basis for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> having a vote worth 1 3 times that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> or for my having a vote worth, say, 10 times that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen.</inline> Where is the democracy in that when the issue is whether the Opposition will act in the manner in which it has acted by denying Supply? That is what it is doing. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Let me move on to the constitutional question. I have not spoken directly in relation to this issue since the contretemps began. A number of lawyers, academics and ordinary members of the public have expressed their views on the constitutional legality and/or propriety of what the Opposition is doing. Most of those persons- 1 do not doubt all of them well meaning- have taken extreme positions one way or the other. The view that I want to put to the Senate- it is a view that I expressed publicly in Queensland recently- is that the constitutional fabric which clothes Australian society does not consist solely of the written Constitution. It consists also of the body of rules, precedents and practices which have been built up over a period of three-quarters of a century and which, in line with the development of the constitutions of other countries where those constitutions are not written, comprise just as important a part of our constitutional fabric as does the written Constitution. Therefore, I am prepared to concede for the purposes of this debate, because I have conceded it publicly that the Senate does have, according to the written Constitution, the strict legal power to reject- but, I will suggest later, not to continue to defer- a money Bill. </para>
        <para>That is only half of the constitutional position that has to be met by an Opposition which will be judged in history as to whether it is acting with constitutional propriety. I repeat that side by side with that written Constitution there lies that body of practice, convention and rules without which this country could not have survived over a period of three-quarters of a century including 2 world wars. That is the simple proposition that I assert. If that view is correct, then there can be no doubt whatsoever that the Opposition is behaving unconstitutionally in this situation. I do not say &#39;illegally&#39; in the sense that court action could be taken against the Opposition or that in some way a judgment of a court could be obtained to the effect that what it is doing is constitutionally illegal. But if 50 per cent of our constitutional fabric is the written Constitution and the other 50 per cent is that body of rules, practice and conventions that I assert it is, then the Opposition, on its own stance, stands convicted of having acted unconstitutionally in this matter and of persisting in acting unconstitutionally in this matter. </para>
        <para>The second constitutional matter to which I wish to refer is the assertion that was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> last week and repeated, although without detailed argument, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> this afternoon. It is that the situation which now confronts the Senate could be solved quite simply because the Constitution, so they said, had written into it the means whereby this very problem could be solved, namely, section 57 and a double dissolution. How demonstrably ridiculous that is. It is pure chance that at the moment there are 22 Bills which could be the subject of a request by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> to the Governor-General for a double dissolution. The suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that section 57 of the Constitution was intended to provide the safeguard for the solution of the type of problem that now confronts the Senate indicates, I suggest, a situation that is either impracticable or at times impossible. How could section 57 possibly be used in the normal case in which an Opposition says that it will block the Budget? If there were no double dissolution Bills, that Bill itself would have to be treated as a double dissolution Bill. But after what period of time? Three months would have to elapse before it could be presented again. Then the further procedure of section 57 would have to be followed. I said that in many cases that procedure would be impossible because there cannot be a double dissolution within 6 months of the date of the expiry of the House of Representatives by effluxion of time. If, fortuitously, there were to be a House of Representatives election in, shall we say, February or March, the procedure of section 57 would be impossible of application. Yet we have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae, Senator Carrick</inline> and, I believe, another senator- I shall not name her because I am not certain in her case- saying that the simple solution to this was put into the Constitution deliberately. What a lot of rubbish! </para>
        <para>I noted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> in his speech this afternoon referred to principles and precedents and to how important it was to preserve them. I noted his words- &#39;principles and precedents&#39;. The Opposition is breaking every principle and every precedent by persisting in this action. I noted his words when he then spoke of the arrogance and the impertinence of the Whitlam Government. It really is a shame that a government can be so arrogant that, after having been returned to power as recently as May 1974, it asserts that it ought to be able to finish its term when it continues to have a majority in the House of Representatives! I wonder whether the arrogance and impertinence would more appropriately lie with the Opposition. I just pose the question. </para>
        <para>Let us have a look at what the Opposition is relying on. There was no doubt that about a week or 8 days ago the Opposition was relying heavily on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> in order to provide the final nail to convince the people that its banditry should be accepted. With a heavy orchestration we find a situation in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> arrived in Sydney last Monday illegally- we have heard the explanation of what happened about that and of how the Government accommodated him- and immediately was embraced, literally, by the Opposition. He was closeted with the Opposition for a considerable period and everyone waited for the revelations that were going to bring down the Whitlam Government. Within 24 hours the attitude had cooled a little. Within another 24 hours it was pretty obvious that nothing was going to happen. Today it became perfectly clear that the Opposition had chickened out. What explanation does it seek to give- or is it an example of its arrogance that it considers it does not have to give explanations? What explanation can it give for having heralded so firmly the arrival of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and for it now having given away any opportunity that it had to call <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> before the Bar of the Senate? The people of Australia will not be fooled by that. The people of Australia can draw only one inference, and that is that the Opposition thought that it had a winner. It turned out to be a loser and the Opposition has dumped it. That is what the Opposition has done. </para>
        <para>I ask the Senate to note that the Opposition&#39;s motion to set up a select committee is not the clear cut proposition that the public might think. The motion was virtually stillborn yesterday because the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> when he gave notice of it, labelled it as a holding motion. What was it holding? Was it holding up the crumbling fabric and the tactics of the Opposition that are reverberating now in its own face? That is usually the fate of brigands, bandits and thugs. The Leader of the Opposition also said yesterday morning that the Opposition would not necessarily proceed with the motion. I suggest that in those words <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> damned the logic of the establishment of such a committee. He damned its purpose, he damned its efficacy and he damned the Opposition itself. </para>
        <para>I ask the Senate to note also that this morning, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said that the motion was not going to be proceeded with today or that it was not the desire of the Opposition to proceed with it today, he also said that it was more than possible that the motion would proceed on Tuesday. Is this the language of a resolute Party? This is an issue that has been blown up out of all perspective by the Opposition until it has become the basis of the death of the Whitlam Government, according to the Opposition. </para>

            <para>- I do not quite understand the relevance of that comment in the context of what I was saying. One could go on but I believe that everyone in this Parliament is bored. Certainly everyone gives that impression- not just because I am speaking. It has been apparent for days. I believe the Opposition has only one honourable thing to do and that is not to act unconstitutionally, which I assert it is doing. Twice in the past week or so <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> has tried to impress on the Opposition how foolishly it is acting because it is welding the Government into a force that, when it wants to go to the people as is its right, will be swept back to power. That is my view. I oppose the Opposition tactics and will continue to do so. </para>

            <para>- I just want to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett</inline> may have misunderstood because the remarks which I made on 22 October were made at the conclusion of my speech when I was running out of time. I then brought together certain of the remarks that I would otherwise have made if I had had time. They were in relation to the situation of a deadlock, the powers of the Senate and the powers of the Governor-General in relation to a double dissolution. I do not wish to be taken as having said what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett</inline> quoted me as having said. Nor does what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett</inline> claims I said appear directly in my speech. I simply indicate that what I was suggesting was that there was no need for the dreadful things to take place which a number of the speakers from the Government side have indicated could take place. That is because the circumstances do exist for a double dissolution as one of the alternatives. There are other alternatives but I did not have time to elaborate on all of them. I do not wish to be taken as being totally ignorant of the implications of section 57 of the Constitution and I make that explanation. </para>

          <para>- This has been an extremely long and wide ranging debate but the wide range which has been covered is justified by the extremely broad motions that are before the Senate this afternoon. In fact, when one looks at the message which was sent to the House of Representatives by the Senate and which is referred to in the amendment moved by the Opposition yesterday, one finds that the whole area of the powers of the Senate, the constitutional issue and so on are canvassed. I refer to message No. 279. The message asserts: </para>

        <para class="block">It is all very well for words of abuse to be hurled at Opposition senators who are carrying out their constitutional responsibility in this place. I for one, having been elected by the people of Western Australia- like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett,</inline> I am proud to claim to be an Australian- intend to vote in a way which I believe best serves the interests of the people of Western Australia. I believe that those interests are best served by getting rid of this most unpalatable Government. There has been a great attempt to drag in red herrings. I suppose the most recent of these was the attempt by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett</inline> to make <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> in some way, a creature of the Opposition. It seems to me that the memories of honourable senators on the Government benches are exceedingly short. They seem to have forgotten completely the debates which took place in this chamber and in the House of Representatives in July when Parliament was recalled by the Government and when the Government tabled various documents and set about defending its role in the loans affair. </para>
        <para>If honourable senators examine the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of July for the House of Representatives they will find that the Government, in the persons of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and of the then Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> defending the most important part played by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> in a search for unprecedented borrowings overseas. It is quite clear that these borrowings were never properly authorised. I refer honourable senators on the Government side to a couple of specific references. I refer them to the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> at page 3600 where in reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> the Prime Minister stated: &#39;Proper checks were made on the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the gentleman involved. &#39; A little later in the debate, at page 3613, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> stated that Treasury inquiries revealed the man&#39;s integrity. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> a little later in the same speech, stated: &#39;I deal with honest people&#39;.&#39; </para>
        <para>There can be no doubt that over a long period this man worked on behalf of the present Government to seek to raise loans which, in July, the Government still defended as being in the national interest. For the Government to turn around and suggest that in some peculiar way <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> has become the creature of the Opposition is quite Pharisaical. I simply say that it is quite clear who introduced <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> into the affairs of Australia and whose agent he was. I draw to the attention of the Government the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser in the House of Representatives in that same debate where he expressed reservations not about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> &#39;s character but about his suitability for the task which had been given him by the Government. Honourable senators will also find a rather scathing reference in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor&#39;s</inline> speech to the so-called sneers and smears of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> with respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline></para>
        <para>So in July we are subjected to Government attack because we are apparently denigrating this wonderful agent of the Australian Government. In October we are being told that, in some way, he is our creature. This is because the Government seeks to run away from the fact that this loans affair has cost it two of its most senior Ministers. It has cost them their positions for misleading the House over these loans. I say that these are significant matters which go towards making up my attitude to get rid of this Government. This has been a debate in which I suppose many of us- I do not excuse myself- have at times been intemperate either in our language or in our interjections. We have sat for 5 weeks. We have sat in the middle of what has been described as a constitutional crisis. I reject the concept of a constitutional crisis. I believe we are simply acting out the proper constitutional processes under our Constitution. 1 do say, however, that we are in the middle of a political crisis. After all, when we get to the point where an Opposition believes that the country is in such a state that it is necessary to send the government back to the people, I suppose we can properly say: &#39;Yes, we are in a state of crisis&#39;. But that crisis is not constitutional. </para>
        <para>There is no threat of a breakdown of government in this country. It is simply an issue which will ultimately have to be determined, as are all political issues in this democracy, at the ballot box. I am looking forward to the opportunity of defending my actions before the electors who have sent me here. I am confident that they will send me back. I am confident that the electors of Western Australia do not adopt the attitude to the Senate which has been adopted by honourable senators on the government side. They say that this is an undemocratic House which is not properly representative and it ought, therefore, to be frightened of carrying out the constitutional responsibilities vested in it. I refer to the speech yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland. At page 1535 of the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> honourable senators will find he stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>So it is certainly stretching all of the known concepts of democracy to suggest that this is a House which is as representative of the will of the people as is the House of Representatives. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I shall stop and analyse that statement for a moment. I recall the frequent debates on electoral redistribution in Australia. All honourable senators will agree that they are debates which often give rise to a great amount of heated discussion. A favourite precedent cited by those who believe that electoral boundaries should be on a strict one vote one value basis is the American Constitution. Recent judgments of the American Supreme Court have asserted, in a most vigorous fashion, that one must apply the principle of one vote one value in the apportionment of electorates for the House of Representatives in that country. Yet do honourable senators on the government side stop and think about the fact that those same arguments are not applied to the United States Senate? This afternoon the Senate has already heard argument put forward by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> on that point. The United States Senate is elected in the same way as the Senate of Australia. There is representation on a State basis. The United States Senate has great constitutional powers, as does this Senate. I know of no argument in the United States that that is undemocratic. I know of no argument before the Supreme Court or of no suggestion by the United States Supreme Court that the position of the Senate in the United States infringes against those Bill of Rights provisions which have given rise to the one vote one value decisions in that court. Honourable senators on the government side must admit that the argument is quite specious. </para>
        <para>The specific constitutional provision in Australia is that we have 2 chambers. One of them is based on electorates which are single member constituencies. Since 1901 there has been a very high level of equality of representation. This chamber is based on representing the people of the different States in an equality. As one who, for some years, has bitterly fought the rather puny but I believe potentially dangerous secessionist movement in Western Australia I believe that an important factor in keeping Western Australians happy is the fact that they are part of Austra lia and that they have a greater degree of representation in this chamber than they can achieve in. the House of Representatives. One does not have to be here for very long to realise that the great weight of numbers in the House of Representatives rests on 2 cities, namely, Sydney and Melbourne. There is an awful lot of Australia and an awful lot to Australia outside those 2 cities. </para>
        <para>I believe that if we are to retain the Federation and if Australia is to remain the cohesive and successful country which it has been for 75 years we must continue to preserve the additional representation, which the less populous States obtain through this chamber. I suggest to all honourable senators that it would be valuable for them- even if they represent New South Wales and Victoria- to spend some time in Tasmania, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. They would realise that distance and a lack of population mean something and that the representation afforded by this chamber means something. I will fight to the death to retain the Senate as we have it now. I believe that as honourable senators we must all look carefully at the Senate and not simply as a matter of party politics set out to denigrate it as so many Labor honourable senators are doing at the moment. I agree with comments which have been made in the debate earlier that there is not a great deal of point in trying to gather together the heads of distinguished lawyers and setting some up on this side and some up on the other side. It is true that there are differences of opinions among quite senior and distinguished lawyers as to the precise constitutional position. I would like to refer to a letter published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and referred to yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
        <para class="block">James McClelland. He quoted only part of that letter, which I think is a pity, but in fairness to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland he made it clear that what he was quoting was not exhaustive. I quote from what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman</inline> Cowper said in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> yesterday because I think it represents the most dispassionate assessment of the so-called constitutional crisis I have seen over the past fortnight. I think the Senate can pay some heed to the assessment because <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman</inline> Cowper&#39;s conclusion is against the stance of the Opposition.  His  judgment is slightly different from mine but as an analysis of the constitutional position I think it is the clearest and least argumentative that I have seen. I quote only a small part of it, paragraph 3, which says: </para>
        <quote>

The other matter which has disturbed me about the debate in this chamber is the great degree to which we are setting up matters of political expediency as matters of principle. It would be bold of me to assert that this has happened only on the other side of the chamber but I do think it has been unhelpful to democracy in Australia that there has been an attempt to justify positions on the basis of principle when in part those stances are based on politics. </para>

          <para>We have had an appeal today that we should heed precedent and practice and that appeal was made most recently by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett.</inline> My attitude in this whole business has been affected by the past practice of the Government Party. We have already had extensive references to the attitude adopted by the now Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> in 1970 when he clearly indicated in the House of Representatives that the then Labor Opposition proposed to oppose the Budget, to destroy the Budget and by destroying the Budget, to destroy the then Gorton Government, a government which I point out had been elected at that time only 10 months. All honourable senators are familiar with the passages in Hansard to which I am referring because they have been quoted so often. What happened when those Budget Bills reached this Senate then, a Senate in which at the time the majority of senators were Opposition senators? They had to face the very practical question: What was the proper course of action they should follow in those circumstances? I ask the Senate to bear in mind that at that time the Government did not have a majority in the Senate. Had all the nongovernment forces combined the Budget could have been defeated. </para>
          <para>I refer now to page 2030 of the Senate Hansard of 4 November 1970 and the words of former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> who then was leading the honourable senators who now sit on the Government benches.

              <para>- It bears repeating when it has also been said so many times that we on this side lack principle in simply delaying these Bills. Also I find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> another Minister now, voted in the same way. I find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> voted in the same way, as did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, and I regret only that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland was not then a senator so that he too could have cast his vote for principle as he would then have seen it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> even found it in his heart to vote &#39; no &#39; on that occasion. </para>

              <para>- I will try not to reflect on the Chair. I withdraw any such reflection. We find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser,</inline> my opposite number from the Whip&#39;s office, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> who is now a Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> who is now a Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> who is now the Leader of the Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne who normally sits in the Chair, also voted in that way. So the Labor view in 1970 was that it was a proper course to set out to destroy a Budget and the Government. I know that this has been said before but is it not the final proof that this argument is about politics, and to dress it up in whole lot of constitutional finery is simply a clever and so far fairly successful attempt to divert attention from the real political arguments on to a specious constitutional issue? I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has gone to a place where his present colleagues agree with the view that he took in 1 970. 1 am pleased also to be able to quote the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Stephen in the recent action in the High Court relating to the Petroleum and Minerals Authority where, referring to the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Stephen said: </para>

          <para class="block">It is very pleasing for us all to note that former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> still has colleagues who agree with his 1970 position. I devote the balance of my time to a matter which is of some importance to all of us as senators and that is the campaign of denigration of the Senate which the Government, particularly the Prime Minister, is conducting. It may well be that it is Labor Party policy to abolish the Senate but that does not mean that many of the Government senators do not carry out in a most proper and conscientious fashion their duties as senators. I believe that in this chamber far more than in the House of Representatives we carry out our duty as legislators. It may ill-behove honourable senators to congratulate the Senate, but in the present situation if we are not prepared to defend our own actions, who else will? I am happy to say that at least one academic is prepared to defend us. I refer to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper of 30 October 1975 of an address given by Professor Gordon Reid, Professor of Politics at the University of Western Australia. The report states in part: </para>

          <para class="block">I for one say that the Senate is in fact a legislative body which carries out its functions. I refer now to the Prime Minister&#39;s weekly broadcast on 12 October 1975 because that contains a fairly classic loaded attack on the Senate. Unfortunately I cannot debate the main subject matter of that address, the Legal Aid Bill which I hope we will deal with in this chamber shortly, but I would like to refer to a couple of statements from the Prime Minister. He said: </para>

              <para>. it&#39;s worth looking more closely at this Opposition tactic of referring Bills to Senate committees. They do it all the time. It&#39;s a familiar and characteristic method of Liberal obstruction. They will neither vote for a bill nor vote against it. </para>

            <para>An even worse example concerned our legislation to clamp down on lurks and fiddles in the share market and securities business. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>When their report - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is, the report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, which is known as the Rae Committee- finally appeared we promptly drafted legislation to deal with the problem. The Opposition majority in the Senate referred the Bill to yet another Senate Committee for a report. That was last April. Since then we&#39;ve seen the crash of one share broking firm, Patrick &#39;Partners. How much more evidence is needed of instability in the stockbroker business- how many more shareholders must burn their fingers- before our legislation goes through? </para>
          <para class="block">To the ignorant, both of those criticisms may seem valid. I would suggest that to not one person in the Senate- Government, Independent, or Opposition- would either of those criticisms have any connection with fact. </para>
          <para>Let us look at this Committee which is so destroying the ability of the Government to deal with share markets and securities- the Senate Select Committee on the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill 1975. The Committee is chaired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges. Senator Georges,</inline> as the  Chairman  of that Committee, has, as is no doubt proper, a casting vote in that Committee. I have checked the resolution of the Senate which set up the Committee and have found that paragraph 7 of it provides that in the event of an equality of voting the  Chairman,  or  Deputy Chairman  when acting as the  Chairman,  shall have a casting vote. So we have a situation where, quite properly, the Government would have a majority if there were a division on a matter on Party lines. I am pleased to think, although that Committee has not yet reported in full, that any division would not be on Party lines. Indeed, when I referred to the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 28 August 1975 I found that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> reported to the Senate in the following terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It has become necessary- and I express this necessity with regret- for the Committee to have further time to consider the Bill which is of some 285 clauses and 8 schedules- a considerable task. There has been wide interest in the Bill and 70 submissions have been received- many of them of considerable substance. However, the Committee has been active, has met on 10 occasions and has had before it representatives of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline>went on to list other organisations which have been before the Committee. </para>
          <para class="block">He referred to the difficulties of having more frequent meetings and said that he could assure the Senate that the Select Committee would apply itself to the task of reporting to the Senate as quickly as possible. I have said all of that simply because I believe that that Committee, as are other committees, is an excellent example of bipartisan legislative activity, the sort of activity that has made this Senate a respected institution in Australia, and I have tried not to make the comment in a partisan sense. I believe that the Committee is working to try to achieve good securities legislation and that if that takes more than a month it is simply because it is a complex and difficult question which needs careful consideration. </para>
          <para>The other Committee that received the lash of the Prime Minister&#39;s tongue was the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on which I served under 2 consecutive Labor Chairmen- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland and subsequently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett.</inline> In my view both of those Chairmen conducted the Committee&#39;s proceedings in a most admirable and proper manner. In its inquiry into a national compensation scheme that Committee, over a period of some six to eight months, held a total of 66 meetings, most of which were full-day meetings. Honourable senators will be aware of what a large additional burden that imposes upon the people who are engaged in the exercise. When we look at the report of that Committee, which was a very large report, we find that a program which the Government put forward, which was estimated to cost in the ultimate some $2,000m a year, was found unanimously by 3 Labor senators and 3 Liberal senators to be defective on not less than 16 agreed points. In other words this major program which was the product of an inquiry- the Woodhouse report- was found on an all-Party basis to be defective. So we reported to the Senate accordingly. We did what I believe the people of Australia elected us to do. </para>
          <para>How has the Government reacted to that? It is very simple to see. It is interesting to compare the words of the responsible Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon,</inline> with the words of the Prime Minister. In a report that he brought into the Parliament within the last week <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> said that the Senate Committee&#39;s main recommendations which have been supported by both Government and Opposition senators, will be incorporated in the new legislation. So the result of those endless, or seemingly endless, 66 meetings and the result of the 8 months delay in the Government&#39;s program will be, I trust, a Bill that is slightly less full of manifest defects than was the original Bill that we considered as a Committee. </para>
          <para>My point is this: Over the last 10 yearsperhaps less- the Senate has, as a legislative body, developed the traditions and, I think, the status which in the present political atmosphere the Government sees as being in its interest to destroy. J hope that Government senators will not join in the witch hunt against the Senate that has been indulged in by the Prime Minister and that they will not try to use the exercising of the constitutional powers of this chamber as a smokescreen to divert the debate from the real questions of politics that are affecting Australia. The fact of the matter is that Australia is now in a situation which nobody in his wildest dreams would have predicted in 1972. </para>
          <para>The fact of the matter is that, except when they have a charge of adrenalin injected into them by a mock issue fomented by that great man of a thousand faces, the Prime Minister, most honourable senators are ashamed of their Government. They know that the people who elected them have been largely neglected. They know that there will be hundreds of thousands of working people out of work after Christmas. If they are not ashamed of that I suppose it is simply a sign of the fact that being in this chamber on $20,000 a year removes them an awfully long way from the people they are supposed to represent. Honourable senators opposite represent a government which has reached the point where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> has had to come into this chamber and say that inflation is such that the Government cannot even plan its social welfare program. I would say that in their heart of hearts many Government senators would be doubly ashamed of the failure of the Government to deal with the question of unemployment and to deal with the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty that have been before the Government for so long, and of the absolutely miserable failure of the Government to live up to its promises of 1972. They would be ashamed of the furtive carryings-on of the loans affair. They would be ashamed of the way that information has had to be forced out of the Government by journalists in a repetition, of the Watergate situation in the United States of America where the wrongdoer owned up only after the truth had been revealed by an inquiring journalist. </para>
          <para>I know that honourable senators opposite are going to retain their excited state for a while under the impetus of the Prime Minister&#39;s wonderful acting ability, but I suggest to them that they ought to give greater consideration to the problems of Australia and the matters which have led Opposition senators to take the course of refusing to proceed with the Budget Bills until an election is called. I believe that we are acting in the best interests of the people of Australia. I believe that we are doing no more than our constitutional duty as senators. I for one look forward to the time when an election is called and our stand is vindicated by the people. </para>

            <para>- We have been treated to a much more gentle speech- a persuasive speech, perhapsfrom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> as he endeavoured to traverse a wide area in expressing the views of the Opposition as to why it has taken this very dangerous step of denying the Government its legitimacy, its finances and its right to govern. He has denied that a constitutional crisis exists, and he has endeavoured to draw upon the experiences of previous Oppositions and governments in the post-war years. I think he must accept that there is a constitutional crisis with us; there is a polarisation between the 2 Houses of Parliament. One cannot ignore the fact that the House of Representatives is locked in mortal combat with the Senate. This matter transcends all the previous attitudes and traditions of the 2 Houses of Parliament. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline>ignored the fact that in the 75 years of Australia&#39;s development since Federation, despite all the trials and tribulations, no government has been subjected to a denial of Supply, and only occasionally has the threat been made. It was made in April 1974 when the Opposition seriously misjudged the position. A threat to deny Supply was made then, as it has been made on this occasion. All of us are aware of the subsequent events. If the Government were to succumb to the pressures of the Opposition it would be presenting to the Australian people the third election in 3 years. I think it does not do the case of the Opposition any good for its speakers to hark back to the occasion in 1970 when an attempt was made by the Australian Labor Party in opposition to reject the Appropriation Bills. That was the only such occasion. It does not do the case of the Opposition any good for its speakers to use that occasion as some substance or some argument to justify the unprincipled position that the Opposition is endeavouring to take on this occasion. That occasion in 1970 was 21 years after the Menzies Government came to power. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> had used every device, every trick and every opportunity to change election dates, to go to the people at times which he considered to be politically advantageous to him and to change the normal timetable of the House of Representatives and Senate elections. In the frustration of that period endeavours were made by the Opposition Party at that time to reject the Appropriation Bills. </para>
          <para>The situation now is entirely different. On this occasion the Opposition is endeavouring to force to the people, to the polls, for the third time in 3 years a government that was legitimately elected after being in the political wilderness for a generation. The Opposition succeeded in forcing the Government to the polls when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> took up the challenge in 1974. The result shows that the Opposition was guilty of a very serious misjudgment. On this occasion the Opposition anticipated that we would do what we did in 1 974. Since 1 974, when we were returned to office, the Opposition has used every manoeuvre, every device at its disposal, to try to prevent the Government from carrying out its legislative program. That is regarded as legitimate activity. In the Twenty-ninth Parliament the Senate has rejected 32 Bills that had been passed by the House of Representatives. Over the years the Senate has rejected hundreds of Bills that had passed through the Lower House. The plain facts are- the Opposition must face up to this-that never in 75 years has the Senate exercised its power to reject a money Bill. The Constitution specifically states that the Senate does not have the power to amend a money Bill. To amend a Bill is only to change its form to some extent. To reject it is a greater penalty. </para>
          <para>So we are arguing that the Senate does not have the traditional or constitutional right to take the course of action which it has taken on this occasion. I refer honourable senators to the platform of the Liberal Party of Australia, which states: </para>
          <quote>

              <item label="2.">

            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Those sentiments are quite contrary to the action that the Opposition has taken on this occasion. I am pleased to follow in the wake of one of my colleagues who referred to the action of honourable senators opposite in their grab for power as the action of bandits. In the political sense he is correct when he puts that sort of description on them. I say that they are pirates attempting to steal the ship of state. They are finding themselves now not enjoying the support that they thought was theirs when they took that decision only a fortnight ago. We must bear in mind that those who claim the sovereignty of this place, those who say &#39;Hear, hear&#39; when I speak about the rights of the Senate, fail to appreciate that it was a person other than a senator who made the decision. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> made the decision and told his Senate colleagues last Tuesday week that the Government was to be denied Supply. He made the decision, and he made it in the mistaken belief that there was support throughout Australia for it. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators opposite, in their contributions to the debate even this day, have said that the catalyst in this decision making of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> was the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor.</inline> We started off the Budget session with the mavericks of the Opposition Parties suggesting that the Government should be denied Supply because of unemployment and inflation. As those issues faded somewhat in their significance, honourable senators opposite decided to latch on to the loans affair. There is no doubt that every encouragement was given by the editorial writer of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> in the editorials of 15, 1 6 and 1 7 October. Those editorials said that the loans affair was the issue and was the reprehensible circumstance that ought to be grasped by the Opposition to bring about an election. They persuaded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> even in the light of his oft repeated statements. It is quite sufficient to relate one of them in this debate. Subsequent to his election as Leader of the Opposition earlier this year he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The basic principle which I adhere to strongly is that a government that continues to have a majority in the House of Representatives has a right to expect that it will be able to govern. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What has been the position? The Opposition put all its eggs into the Khemlani basket. It believed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> would produce evidence that would prove that this Government was not fit to remain in office and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> would be able to show that the Prime Minister or other Ministers of the Crown had in some way or other misled the Parliament. Two lawyers associated with the Opposition spent days going through 8 suitcases of documents. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott.</inline> I think I could describe <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> as a senior member of the Opposition Parties. What did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> say after he had gone through the documents? The transcript of a recent <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> program states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>But today, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bob</inline> Ellicott, the Liberal front bencher who spent last night poring over the Khemlani documents, flew to Sydney to address a Rotary Club luncheon. After the lunch he blew the lid off the issue when he told an ABC news reporter there is no direct evidence in the documents he saw which involved the Prime Minister. It seems that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> had dropped the story that the government had been waiting for. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He dropped the story and the excuse for which the Opposition has been waiting. Since the beginning of the Budget session the Opposition has set out to create a political climate. It has set out to create the conditions on which this Government would accept the gauntlet that was thrown down to it by denying the passage of the Appropriation Bills. The Opposition expects the Government to go to an election meekly, weakly and sweetly. It is to the credit of the Government that it has stood its ground. Let me set at rest the minds of Opposition senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> has done more to unite the Labor Party than has any single person within the Labor Party. The arrogant grab for power which he set in motion only a fortnight ago has failed and is clearly now not enjoying any support from the Australian people. Very soon after that move was made by the Opposition it was apparent that public opinion was not going to swing behind it. The gallup polls which were published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> newspapers surely indicate clearly how the Opposition has again misjudged the situation and how it has failed in its attempts to force the Government to a poll for the third time in 3 years. </para>
          <para>Ever since this Government came to office it has been confronted with hostility and frustration in the Senate. I do not wonder that the Prime Minister has, in one way or another, expressed his frustration and concern at this continued arrogance which those political parties which have the numbers in this place have attempted to wield. The Opposition in the Senate has in these circumstances applied its mentality to a siege tactic in which rational debate has been replaced by irrational debate and irrational conduct. The polarisation which has taken place not only in the Parliament but also within the community itself is something with which the Opposition will have to live. There is no doubt that it is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs that this polarisation should be taking place. The decision that was taken was taken in the interests of those members of the Opposition who want to get back into power. I am sure that the subjective attitudes of the shadow ministers will be leading the pack in the Liberal Party meeting room. They felt that they were on a winner. They felt that they had the opportunity to hit home at the Government, to defeat the Government on the loans affair. </para>
          <para>What are the factors involved in the loans affair? First of all, no loans were ever raised. Secondly, no commission was ever paid. Thirdly, none of the documents, none of the statements that have been presented, has shown any irregularity on the part of the Government. It has been apparent to honourable senators on the Government side of the chamber that over the last week or so Opposition senators have sat in their places like stunned mullet. They have not been able to understand why the community has reacted as it has. They have not been able to understand that the Australian people are interested in a fair go for a government, that they are interested in the democratic processes with which the Labor Party has been associated ever since it was formed in 1 89 1 . </para>
          <para>The very behaviour of Opposition senators in this place this week has been an indication of the tension and the pressures being exerted on them. We have seen incidents on 2 occasions. Yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> attempted to take away our right to present petitions and today <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> took another extremist position in relation to Portuguese East Timor. We have seen members of the Opposition parties dissociating themselves from the extremist positions taken by some other members of the Opposition. There is evidence that the Liberal edifice is beginning to crumble. </para>
          <para>We are subjected in these debates to propaganda and exaggeration from Opposition senators. We saw some examples of that this morning. I shall refer to only one of them because time will not permit me to deal with more than one instance. I wrote down the words that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> used. He said that this Government was concerned with rigging the electoral laws. That sort of exaggerated comment is one of the reasons that the Opposition parties are not able to win majority support in the electorate. Let us face it; that was one of the issues upon which we fought an election in 1974. It was a double dissolution issue. The joint sitting determined the new electoral laws based on the principle upon which the Liberal Party, the Labor Party, the American Constitution and the Australian Constitution are supposed to be based, and that is the principle of one vote one value. Yet, in that exaggerated language which so often emanates from that quarter of the Opposition, that is regarded as rigging the electoral laws. </para>
          <para>It is that sort of behaviour pattern which is filtering through to the electorate. It is doing so in such a way that the gallup polls published today indicate that almost three out of four Australians dissociate themselves from the tactics being pursued by the Opposition. The gallup polls indicate also the popularity of the Party leaders. It is true that the popularity of the Prime Minister has been down somewhat in relation to what it had been a year or so ago, but the fact is that the latest poll shows that his popularity has risen considerably and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser&#39;s</inline> popularity has dropped very considerably since the start of the Budget session. God only knows how much more that will be reflected in the next popularity poll of the leaders. In the current poll <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> is shown as having 37 percent support and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> as having 34 per cent support. I venture to predict that when the next poll is taken, following the Opposition&#39;s disastrous decision, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> will find himself outstripped completely by the Prime Minister. What has emerged from this opportunist grab for power is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> has shown himself to be not a credible alternative Prime Minister, and I think it might even show to the Opposition parties that he is not even a credible leader of the Liberal Party. </para>
          <para>The loans affair has been made an issue of substance for a considerable number of months. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> who was traduced by the Opposition senators earlier this year, suddenly became a person of interest and of great concern and a person on whom the Opposition spent a great deal of time in recent days. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> is not a Trojan horse. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> has not been able to do more than present documents which are documents which have been passed legitimately between himself and Ministers of the Crown in respect of the Government&#39;s overall objectives of obtaining funds so that we may purchase equity in the natural resources of our country. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> denied that the documents implicated the Prime Minister. We have seen the coercion which the shadow cabinet exerted on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> when he returned to Canberra on Tuesday evening when he was forced to issue a second statement. That is the sort of behaviour which the journalists, the political commentators and the people are picking up. They know something of what is happening in the Senate of this country. They should compare <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser&#39;s</inline> current position on the Budget with what he said about the Budget previously, namely that it was a responsible Budget, that there was some merit in it. Yet in its insatiable desire to get back into political power in this country the Opposition has taken the step of trying to delay the passage of the Appropriation Bills and it has taken up an extremist position. </para>
          <para>It is interesting to note that the extremists of those who seek power in the community and of those who have occupied political power in the community, always seem to have had recourse to the same sort of phraseology- whether it be the phraseology that was used in Germany in the 1930s, in Italy in the 1920s, by General Franco in the late 1930s, or by the military groups in Chile or Greece. At those times the people always used phrases, such as they claimed to be acting in the interests of the people; they were responding to the call of the nation; or they were acting in defence of the best interests of the people and in defence of democracy. It is very interesting to find how those phrases fit into the Fraser phraseology. He used precisely that terminology several weeks ago when he justified his decision to try to undermine public confidence in this Government. </para>
          <para>It is good to see that the Australian people have rejected this opportunist move that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> and his colleagues made only a fortnight ago. It is good to know that the Australian people are able to see through the manoeuvre. It is good to see that even the newspapers, which were in the forefront of the campaign to defeat this Government and to force it to an election in December of this year, are now forced to put on their front pages details of the result of public opinion polls which justify the principal position that the Australian Government has taken. It is to be hoped that the Australian people will appreciate that in this chamber it is not just the Australian Labor Party senators who are supporting this position. The independent senator and the senator from the Liberal Movement are also supporting it. There is a welling up in the community- among academics, lawyers, church leaders and those people who are concerned with the democratic processes- an understanding that what is happening here in the Senate in October 1975 is a matter of regret and a matter that must be resisted at all costs. We can assure the Australian people that from our side of the chamber we will fight to retain this Government. We will fight against the endeavours to deny financial means to carry on. We will mobilise the Australian people. We will win the minds and the support of the Australian people in this constitutional-cum-political crisis which has been engineered by the Opposition. </para>

              <para>- Thank you very much, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen.</inline> This debate has given us a further opportunity to continue to expose the deceit, the impropriety, the incompetence and the lack of integrity of this Government. Its incompetence is almost unbelievable. This applies particularly to economic affairs. Of course, this is one of the major issues which concern us today. In 1 972 this Government inherited a stable economy- one of the most stable economies in the developed world. In a matter of months, and only months, the Government converted this to one of the most unstable economies in the developed world. This was done by its own reckless policies. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>We know that the Government continually sought to lead us to believe that the economic problems facing Australia were imported from overseas. We remember time and again that this was given as the excuse. The report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which has been quoted and which I quoted during the Budget debate put paid to this nonsense once and for all. The OECD report clearly sheeted home the responsibility for Australia&#39;s economic problems, its devastating inflation rate- about the second highest in the developed world- its ever-increasing unemployment rate, its high interest rates and its internal domestic policies. Of all the countries in the developed world we were most isolated from events outside. We were almost completely isolated from the energy crisis which had such a devastating effect upon the economies not only of the developed countries but also of many of the developing countries, lt is interesting to note that, because of sound economic policies, the rate of inflation in Japan, which was among the countries which were most affected by the energy crisis, is decreasing rapidly. The last figures that I saw showed that the rate was down to about 10 per cent, and it is expected to be a single figure rate before the end of this year. </para>

This has happened because of the sound and tough economic policies which were followed by the Japanese Government. The same thing has happened with the German economy. Here again, the German economy recovered remarkably quickly while we are still wallowing in an economic crisis caused by the lack of policies of this Government. </para>

          <para>- I rise on the adjournment and not for any length of time, to refer to the completely disgraceful abdication of ministerial responsibility which was displayed this morning in this chamber by the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland).</inline> He was asked 2 questions by me, each of which was followed by a supplementary question, as to why he had given a misleading answer to the Senate in April of this year and why he had made a grossly defamatory statement about an individual who has no opportunity to defend his name because of the privilege which covers the statements of Ministers in this place. Far from the Minister retracting or indicating regret for the statement he had made, he persisted in it and compounded the defamation in which he had engaged. When asked about the source of the information on which he had said he relied and which he believed to be true, he said bluntly that he was not going to give the source of his information. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In times when the other issues which are concerning us were not in the forefront of our consideration, an answer of that description from a Minister would have led to a motion of no confidence in that Minister. The essence of our parliamentary system and the accountability of Ministers to the Parliament is that they will provide the information and the answers to the members of Parliament who seek it. It is in that way that the public at large is involved, and when Ministers regard themselves as so above the other members of the chamber and so above the people of this country that they are not prepared to answer questions on fundamental matters affecting an individual&#39;s rights, then we have the true authoritarianism which stamps the dictatorship. There are so many instances of this Government regarding itself as immune from criticism, above accountability and completely irresponsible as to make that suggestion of authoritarianism not at all unreal. </para>
        <para>Earlier this year I raised in the Senate my concern at the allegations of a man who was a former Australian Security Intelligence Organisation agent whose name was Max Wechsler. He had resigned from ASIO because he considered that the Government was wilfully and culpably inactive in regard to matters on which he had given information in the course of his duties. I detailed those allegations, and the allegations were made also to a newspaper, so they have been publicised in 2 places. The Government ignored what this man said instead of attempting to answer the matter or, as might be suggested as an appropriate course, providing to me in confidence information which was related to the security of this country. That is always a course which can be adopted. The Government chose to abandon any such pretence. It ridiculed and treated as mere political point making what was a serious question. No answer was given and no answer was attempted. All that occurred was a rubbishing exercise in defaming the character and standing of this man. At least one completely false statement was made deliberately by a Minister in this chamber. Maybe other false statements also were made. </para>
        <para>The Senate will recall that I related what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wechsler</inline> had told me and what was part of the same story he had told to newspapers. The response of the Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, was directed in a manner of complete evasion and belittling of the informant by the ridiculing of his standing and therefore of his story. That is a procedure which works successfully when one does not have an answer to the facts. It is a procedure whereby one rubbishes the man who tells the story. One accuses him of being a paranoid, an unbalanced character, a psychotic- all of which descriptions <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland used- and it is done under cover of parliamentary privilege. One then seeks by development of humour and laughter to ridicule the man in question and therefore not answer his story but say: &#39;Who could believe the story of a man like that?&#39; I might say that that is the way in which the menace of communism in this country has been ridiculed in this Parliament by members of the Labor Party over almost 2 decades. It is so typical of what happened in this particular case as to warrant, I believe, some exposure. </para>
        <para>What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland said in the course of his speech on 2 1 April was designed to suggest that this man was unbalanced. He claimed, of course, that the allegations were a farce. He did not say that they were untrue; he said that they were a farce. He said that this man had postured an outlandish story. It was told by a person who was obviously a pathetic psychological misfit. It was a skilful use of words under parliamentary privilege purposefully denigrating, and simply for the sake of ridiculing what was said. Then there was the language that this was an extraordinary young neurotic, unverified character named Wechsler. Why call him neurotic? It was said that he was an obviously neurotic, unbalanced young man. What is the evidence for that? The Minister finished up on a basis which was designed, I suppose, to be the king hit because I had not heard from this young man after he had related his story. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland said: </para>

            <para>-Does it matter who paid his fare? Is that in some way to ridicule or denigrate his story? The fact is that he was overseas at the time and the fact is that he was unaware until he returned of what was said in this Parliament. When he found out he sought me out and he was concerned. Is it a matter which Labor senators regard as of no consequence that a person outside this Parliament can be declared, on the say-so of a Minister, to be a mental case when there is absolutely no foundation for it. It is something which Labor senators regard as quite proper that when the matter is brought before the Minister he does not seek to apologise or in any way as a matter of regret explain his answer but simply compounds what was said. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Is it proper in the eyes of Labor senators that when I seek the basis of the information upon which he made this allegation the Minister says:  You are not going to get it?&#39; He gave a categorical, unrevealing- or maybe it was revealing- no. I raise these matters because they ought to be raised, and I am interested in the silence of the Labor senators. Why is it that the Minister has adopted this attitude? 1 believe that he has an obligation to explain himself to the Parliament. I sent to his office about three-quarters of an hour ago the information that I proposed to speak on the adjournment in regard to this man Wechsler. Perhaps the Minister is unable to be here; I do not know. But his office was given notice of the fact that I proposed to raise this matter. </para>

            <para>- It is not a matter of order to raise that point. If the Minister is elsewhere, let him state where he is or why he chooses to be elsewhere instead of coming here. The points which I have raised are points which require an explanation. I know some of the things which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wechsler</inline> has been doing since he has been overseas because he saw me within the last week and related them to me. I understand he has related them to other people also. He was denied assistance in West Germany. On application to the Australian Embassy in that country after he had made some approaches to the West German police about some money which was stolen from him, he was told that no assistance was available to him from the Australian Embassy in Bonn. I would be grateful if some explanation could be given to the Senate as to the Government&#39;s side of that story. He was in the Czech Embassy in London for a period of time, some of which was against his will. This was related to the Special Branch of Scotland Yard. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>This is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wechsler</inline> has told me. It may be lies; it may not be lies. I am simply seeking information. He also spoke to staff at the Australian High Commissioner&#39;s office in London. So the record of whether he did that will be there. I would be interested to know why the Australian High Commissioner&#39;s office said that it was not interested in what had happened to him or what had been said. It may be that there is concern on the part of the Government as to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wechsler&#39;s</inline> revelations. He was employed by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, and the Minister conceded that when he spoke on the matter in the Senate on 2 1 April. In the Czech Embassy <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wechsler</inline> was shown documents which he believes could have come only from ASIO in this country. He was shown a photocopy of his passport.  His  passport had been issued only in March of this year. He was shown photographs of meetings which he had held in Australia which he believed could have come only from sources which were close to ASIO. </para>
        <para>It may be that the allegations which he made and which I have detailed in the Senate ought to be investigated and ought to be more widely known. I believe that these are matters upon which some explanation ought to be forthcoming. I again state that if the purpose of the Minister&#39;s untrue assertions of April of this year is simply to ridicule the man who made these assertions, it would be apparent that he was ridiculing him because there was no answer to them. I make mention of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wechsler</inline> had said that he knew that people such as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns, Dr Cass</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Enderby</inline> had actively concerned themselves with the restoration into the Australian Labor Party of the Trotskyist group which the Young Labor Association in Victoria had expelled from the Labor Party. It may be that these accounts are matters of concern which cannot be answered and therefore they are ridiculed. I make the assertion and I await the answer. I expect that in due course the Minister will give the answer. </para>

          <para>- Naturally, I will not be answering for the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> because he is capable of doing that himself, and quite eloquently. But I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> a man of some standing in the community, should place his credibility in jeopardy by reliance on an individual whose history he has quoted to us in part, but certainly not in full. If my memory serves me correctly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> raised this matter in the early part of March on 3 occasions. The whole purpose of the exercise was to attempt to vilify the Party of which I happen to be a member and, as a consequence, to attack the credibility of the Government. He was able to obtain some headlines of the kind that an armed takeover was imminent in Australia. This was linked with some groups within the Australian Labor Party to the Australian Labor Party itself. On that occasion I questioned the credibility of the source of his information. I think that we are entitled to do this. </para>

I invite- I say this quite sincerelymembers of the Opposition and my own colleagues, if they have not read this article, to read it right through, because it is like something out of a James Bond novel. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>I should have preferred to have left my reply oblique, but now I have to spell the information out specifically. My information is- and this comes from ASIO, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> wants to know- that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wechsler</inline> was a casual informant, paid casually and not taken seriously. He was a man who, like many hundreds of people who give information to ASIO, was not believed without corroboration. ASIO regard him as an unbalanced character, a man who was always claiming that his life was threatened, that his house had been burgled and who was not taken seriously in respect of the information that he gave to ASIO. Perhaps the reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has not heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wechsler</inline> for a long rime- and this is a piece of information that he has forced me into giving- is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wechsler</inline> has been, on my information, in a mental institution in Queensland for some time. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I cannot vouch for the latter part of the Minister&#39;s information, but I am sure that the Minister&#39;s claim, in his reply, that the information he had received was from ASIO and that this person was employed casually and paid casually for his information is correct. Of course <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wechsler</inline> was not taken seriously. If one goes through these articles that purport to be the true story of Max Wechsler, the super spy, one finds that he says, first of all, that he was receiving no payment for his services, then that he received some payment, and subsequently that his payments were increased until he was a full time official of ASIO. </para>

I asked the Minister at the time whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wechsler</inline> would have been entitled to social security payments at the same time as he was receiving an income from another source. That question has never been answered either. It is only one of many. There is no doubt that this is another example of the technique which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> employs quite consistently. Over the years he has employed it quite extensively in his attempt to cause people to believe that this country is under dire threat of either internal armed insurrection or, alternatively, that there is an imminent threat which could destroy our democratic institution. I repeat what I said on the last occasion this matter was raised: If there is any threat to the security of this country- I say this quite deliberately- it comes from people such as you, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> who misuse and abuse the privileges that are extended to us in order to represent people who endeavour to create fear, division and panic in the community. Fortunately, the honourable senator&#39;s attempts have not been successful in the past. I am sure that they will be treated in the same way on this occasion. </para>

        <para class="block">I raise this matter because as Manager of Government Business in the Senate I have some responsibilities to my Party. I say frankly and openly that neither I as Manager of Government Business in the Senate nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> as Leader of the Government in the Senate at any time made any request to the Opposition to have deferred any debate on the setting up of a committee to investigate the loans affair. It is to be regretted that for the first time there has been a  breakdown in the understanding of arrangements that have been entered into between the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and me as Manager of Government Business in the Senate since I was appointed to that position after the 1 974 elections. The simple fact is that there was no request on my part, and I emphasise that, and it is dishonest to say, to suggest or to imply in any way that there was any request on my part or on the part of the Leader of the Government in the Senate to defer any debate today on the notice of motion to sei: up a committee to investigate the loans affair. I feel I must refer to what transpired this morning shortly after 9 o&#39;clock. In my usual way I spoke with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> about the prospective order of business of the Senate and at that time, shortly after 9 o&#39;clock, he advised me that he would be proceeding with the notice of motion. I told him that at that time I was only speaking personally and that I would have to have discussions with my colleagues, but that, subject to discussions with my colleagues, I should think that the Government would probably move- I  emphasise the word &#39;move&#39;- for the adjournment of the debate until Tuesday, in accordance with the normal procedure, to enable the Executive and also the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party to consider the matter. That, as everyone knows, is the normal procedure that is adopted between the political parties when one moves on matters of importance of this nature. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline>then asked me whether, if that were so, I would agree, or the Government would agree, to the extension of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> &#39;s visa, which expires next Monday. I said I could not give any guarantee or undertaking because that was a matter for my colleague the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland),</inline> with whom I had not even discussed the matter at that time. He was unaware of the conversations that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and I were having. That was at about ten past nine this morning. When we came into the Senate at 10.30 this morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> and me what we intended doing with respect to his notice of motion. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> who confirmed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> at the Senate table that, after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> had moved his motion, we would then propose the adjournment of debate on the motion until the next day of si tting. </para>
        <para>Again <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> asked about a proposed extension of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> &#39;s visa and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wreidt</inline> told him that, in his opinion and in the opinion of the Government, the Opposition had had ample time and ample opportunity to move to have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> called to the Bar of the Senate or to bring on its notice of motion and that so far as he was concerned the Government would not agree to an extension of the visa after Monday. Then I said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> had been here for about a week and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said that it was not a week, that he had been here since last Monday. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> said that so far as we were concerned the matter could go on today but we would be moving for the adjournment of the debate. </para>
        <para>It was at about that time that question time was called on. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> went away and subsequently came back and told us that he would not be proceeding with his notice of motion today. That was a matter for decision by the Opposition members themselves. It was a decision that was made not at the request- I emphasise the words &#39;not at the request&#39;- of the Government. It is quite wrong to suggest that the Government requested the deferral of any debate on the setting up of a committee to investigate the loans affair. </para>

            <para>-Of course we did not tell him that. We told him that we would be moving for the adjournment of the debate when the debate came on. He would have moved &#39;That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> moving a motion relating to the order of business on the notice paper&#39;. If he had moved that, it would undoubtedly have been carried because we would not have opposed it. He would then have sought to bring on General Business notice of motion No. 17, which is that a select committee of the Senate be appointed to inquire into and report upon all aspects of the overseas loan raising activities of the Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>He would have moved that that matter take precedence of Government Business. We would have opposed that motion. We are here today to seek passage of the Appropriation Bills and the Loan Bill. We believe that they are matters of top priority for the Australian people and the Australian nation. We would have opposed that General Business matter taking precedence of Government Business. I again thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack for his earlier interjection. Because of the Opposition&#39;s weight of numbers it would have been successful in having that matter brought on. It would have come on. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> would have given the reasons for moving the motion. We would then have moved for an adjournment of the matter until the next day of sitting. I refer again to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack &#39;s interjection. Because of the weight of numbers that the Opposition has in the Senate, if it had so chosen it could have forced the debate to continue today. If the Opposition was concerned that it would not get a determination of the matter today, again because of its sheer weight of numbers in the Senate it could have moved at any time, as it moved last Wednesday, That the question be now put&#39;. Undoubtedly that motion would have been carried. </para>
        <para>So I say quite frankly to the Opposition that, if it had wanted to discuss this matter today and if it had wanted the matter determined today, because of all the arrangements, because of the Standing Orders and because of its weight of numbers in this place, it could have had that matter determined today. I take umbrage at the suggestion that I, as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, or that my esteemed colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> as Leader of the Government in the Senate, in any way made a request to the Opposition to defer any debate on the setting up of a committee to investigate the loans affair. The simple fact is that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was in Australia 3 weeks ago the Opposition was then told that although the Government opposed on principle the calling of witnesses before the Senate, it would not oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> &#39;s appearing if the Opposition moved in that way. But no effort was made by the Opposition at that time so to move. </para>
        <para>Despite <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> &#39;s return to Australia this week, despite his statement that he came back to Australia to clear his name, despite the fact that the Parliament has sat for 3 days this week, no attempt has been made by the Opposition to move in this place for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> to be called to the Bar of the Senate. That, no doubt, is due to the obvious embarrassment which the Opposition suffered when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> was called before the Bar of the Senate at the special session of the Senate some time in July. On that occasion the Opposition believed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> would provide evidence of illegal or improper conduct on the part of the Government. Instead <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> was unable to provide any evidence which supported the Opposition&#39;s case. As we all know from Press reports, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> has been in Canberra this week and has been in contact with the Opposition. The Opposition could have moved at any time to have him called before the Bar of the Senate. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> indicated, whilst we object in principle to the calling of witnesses before the Bar of the Senate, we would not oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> &#39;s appearing if the Opposition moved that way. It is quite obvious that the Opposition now has grave reservations about any evidence that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> may give. I suggest to the Senate that the Press statement issued by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate is a mere smokescreen. </para>
        <para>Finally, I want to assure my colleagues of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party and, indeed, the members of the Labor movement throughout Australia that I, as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> as </para>
        <para class="block">Leader of the Government in the Senate, made no request for a deferral of any debate on the setting up of a committee to investigate the loans affair. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir MAGNUS</inline>CORMACK (Victoria) (5.48)- I would like to make some observations on this matter. Over the last 18 months the Senate has been locked in a very difficult problem. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, who has just resumed his seat, was acknowledged by the Opposition in a new designation for the Senate of Manager of Government Business in the Senate. The reason that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)-!</inline> assume he did so with the consent of the Opposition- put down a new appointment in the Senate was that for a substantial period the business of the Senate and its conduct had broken down as a result of a total inability on the part of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> to obtain a determination and an undertaking from the then Leader of the Government in the Senate. The Prime Minister then intervened and, through his Party and with the consent of the Opposition, designated a particular honourable senator to be the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. </para>
        <para>In other words, 2 elements were involved in this. The Prime Minister, with a constitutional understanding, realised that the parliamentary system has to work and, as it was impossible for the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate to work with the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, introduced a new intermediary into the procedures of the Senate, namely the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. The first acknowledgment of that was the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland. It is an old-established parliamentary principle that a parliamentary system cannot work unless there is an understanding between the Leader of the Opposition and someone on the other side of the table. I have a good deal of experience in this. I do not know the ins and outs of this, the 2-sided conversations that must have taken place between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, because they have not been disclosed- Only one side of the conversation has been disclosed, and that is the conversation that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland recollects. </para>
        <para>I consider that it is an improper process of the parliamentary procedure. One of the unwritten conventions about which we have been hearing so much recently is that dissensions and discussions between the leaders- the Manager of Government Business in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition- should not be disclosed in the Senate. That is an unwritten parliamentary convention. This convention has been breached by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I think it would fruitless, profitless and not in any way becoming to the dignity of the Senate to allow this debate to be continued any longer. I think, if I may offer this opinion to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> with the greatest deference, that at this stage you might conclude the business by ordering the Senate to adjourn. </para>

          <para>- I agree almost totally with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack has said, but if that convention or principle is to be maintained it ought not to suffer the misrepresentation for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has been responsible. I think this has led to what may have been a disclosure of confidential conversation across the table, and it needed to be disclosed to show how the true situation had been misrepresented. In considering this problem- I will deal with it only shortly because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland has covered the whole ground- it must be realised from the motion of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> gave notice- it was fairly obvious from the nature of the motion- that it was intended to proceed with the motion today forthwith, using the power that the Opposition has, the power of numbers. If we look at the motion of which notice has been given we see that paragraph (3) states: </para>

        <para class="block">That again indicates that the Opposition intended to proceed, irrespective of the fact that the Government would not have been able to appoint its members to the Committee. What was a matter of urgency yesterday surely was a matter of urgency today. It is fairly obvious that the Opposition parties have pulled away from their determination to set up such a committee and from their determination to call <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> before this chamber. </para>
        <para>I shall refer to another matter which shows just how the Leader of the Opposition has misrepresented what has occurred in this chamber. I think that the Leader of the Opposition ought to be called to account by the Senate. This situation may be the result of some work done by his public relations man.

        <para class="block">Other things follow from that, but I want to concentrate on that statement and that statement alone. There was a gross misrepresentation by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition, of what had occurred in the Senate at the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> was called before the Senate. Secondly, he inferred that the Chair was at fault on that occasion because he used the words &#39;unless the Senate was rigidly controlled from the Chair&#39;.

If that is the way in which the Opposition wishes to play the game in this place, then it can expect to have strong objection from this side. There have been 3 instances of misrepresentation having taken place over the last 2 days which led to a distortion in the Press, to misinformation and to the fraying of tempers even more than they have been frayed today.

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>I believe it is rather humorous that the Government can push the Opposition around so strongly in this way by making a simple request which would delay the important matter of the appearance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> and yet for 2 weeks now the Government has been asking the Opposition to pass the Budget and it has found a different response. That response, of course, is a convenient one, and I do not believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers&#39;</inline> statement. I was here and I listened to his substantive remarks as to why he proceeded as he did. I reiterate that I do not believe his Press statement is a true representation of those remarks. I believe it suits the Opposition to string this matter out because it does not intend to have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> come before a select committee. The fact is that on the strategy outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> the Opposition has put its program back one sitting day, if it intends to proceed with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> in such a way. If it introduces this measure on Tuesday it must on any reasonable request by the Government agree to an adjournment until Wednesday. So it has delayed its program by one sitting day in that fashion. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>My reason for rising was that I had prepared a series of amendments to the proposal that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> had suggested he would put before the Senate. Those amendments were designed to give the two of us here who are not aligned and who are not members of the major parties a representative on the select committee. Therefore I had a particular interest in the progress of that proposed motion. I spoke to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland)</inline> to find out what was happening. He informed me exactly as he has informed the Senate tonight. He expected the Opposition to proceed. He was doubtful, as we all were, whether the Opposition would agree to an adjournment of the debate. But the Minister expected the Opposition to proceed and to have the motion placed before the Senate. </para>
        <para>It was a complete surprise to me, as I am sure it was to the Minister, to find that the Opposition simply did not proceed to put the motion and reach the stage where the debate could be adjourned. Certainly I had prepared my amendments on the basis that the Opposition might very well have used its numbers to suspend Standing Orders and to proceed right through the motion. The very least I expected was the motion to be put before the Senate, to be seen there and to be considered over the weekend. It was certainly within the prerogative of the Opposition to choose net to do so. It could not be within the province of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> to claim that in some way he had been pressured by the Government not to proceed to have the matter made the subject of an adjourned debate. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline>has not earned any benefit of doubt about this matter. In my 18 months here I have heard him make scoundrels of people who want fair redistribution proposals for this nation. In recent times I have heard him make scoundrels of those people who have supported the contention that governments are made and broken only in the lower House, and I have heard the many other twists of the truth in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has been involved. On his track record I must disbelieve him. </para>

As a proponent of government management his track record in South Australia is lamentable. So I pass it by and content myself with two or three very simple observations. As one who can see through the smokescreen of the long tautological statement by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland),</inline> which turns entirely upon the difference between a request and a motion for the adjournment of the appointment of the committee, in sanctimonious and prescient words <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall said that he must agree that the Opposition would have been bound to grant an adjournment if it was moved by the Government. </para>

He is not here in the Senate chamber when we are considering a matter which used to be the subject of an understanding between the Leaders in the Senate. As everybody knows, to some extent, over the last 12 months we have had understandings respected by both sides. Of course, what we have today is a clear breach of an understanding made between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> about a matter for debate next week. They decided on the matter mutually, and I emphasise the word &#39;mutually&#39;. We know that discussion was conducted across the table. I heard some of it. In addition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall relates that he consulted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland about the arrangements. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>So, what is this talk we hear from the Opposition about courtesy when arrangements have been made today consistently with a practice which has worked fairly well? It is a sign of a new arrogance on the part of the Opposition. Not only does the Opposition make an arrangement, but its Leader goes out of the Senate and makes a Press statement- not about whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland has defaulted but about a debate which would proceed next week. He knew- I overhear the conversation at the tablethat such a debate would not be completed today. So it is a ruse. Of course, what the Opposition should have done, if it was intending to proceed with this matter constructively, was to carry out its promise or indication that it would call Khemlani before the Senate. The Opposition will not use the opportunity because it knows that there is no substance in proceeding in that fashion. But it wants to keep the scare going by setting up a select committee of the Senate. That is the whole stunt. It wants to have a select committee which will be sitting during a period of controversy in order to keep dragging things before the public with the assistance of the newspaper barons. The Opposition thinks that in that way it can divert the argument that we and the public now find has been exploited. </para>
        <para>Along with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, I want to resist what is contained in the public statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> He is becoming erratic. He must be, because he talks about the courtesy of the Opposition. He uses these words: </para>

I think it is a new indication of the sort of concern which the public is having that there is a new arrogance about the Opposition. It intends to use its numbers. It does not intend to debate these issues. It intends to use its numbers to keep the scare going in the hope that will influence the Australian electorate. I do not think it will. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Is it a fact that the funds to be made available to cooperative housing societies in Victoria in 1975-76 have been reduced from the amount of $69m sought by the Victorian Government to $29m? Does the Minister agree that the reduction of funds available will mean that many prospective home owners will have to wait an indefinite period before their applications can be considered? Does the reduction affect some 120 housing societies in Victoria which are providing loans for those people in the middle income group who are ineligible for housing commission homes and who are unable to service higher interest loans from other lending institutions? How does the Minister see the likely effect of this severe cut in funds on employment in the home building industry? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Minister for Housing and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The 1 973-1 974 Housing Agreement is the means by which the Australian Government makes advances to the States for housing authority purposes, and for allocation to the States&#39; Home Builders&#39; Accounts for lending through co-operative housing societies to prospective home owners on low to moderate incomes. </para>
            <para>Allocation of advances for the 1975-76 financial year was considered in the overall context of the Budget and it was necessary, in determining the amount for each State, for the Government to have regard to the exigencies of the current economic situation which called for a greater measure of restraint in Government spending than we would otherwise favour. </para>
            <para>Nevertheless, there has been no reduction in the total amount to be made available to Victoria under the Agreement in 1975-76. The allocation of $98.159m is the same as the total of advances actually made in 1974-75. This is over <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> times more than the amount of $39m that was allocated for welfare housing in Victoria in 1972-73, the last year of the previous Liberal-NCP Government. </para>
            <para>Under the terms of the Agreement normally between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of the total advances made to a State in respect of a fin ancial year is required to be allocated to its Home Builders&#39; Account. However, the Agreement provides for more than 30 per cent to be allocated to the Account in a financial year when special circumstances warrant it and accordingly, in 1974-75, 37 per cent of the total, i.e. $36.359m, was allocated to the Victorian Home Builders&#39; Account. </para>
            <para>The amount sought by Victoria for the Home Builders&#39; Account for 1975-76 was $53.67m, not $69m. The amount allocated is $29.448m and this was determined after consultation with the State Minister of Housing on the distribution of the total allocation between the Home Builders&#39; Account and the housing authority. The State Minister recommended that the Home Builders &#39; Account receive 30 per cent of the total and the Housing Commission the remaining 70 per cent. The 1975-76 allocation of $29.448m is almost <inline font-style="italic">2Vt</inline> times more than the $ 11.25 m allocated to the Victorian Home </para>
            <para class="block">Builders&#39; Account in 1972-73, the last year of the previous Government. </para>
            <para>In making comparisons with 1974-75 the special nature of the situation that prevailed in that year should be borne in mind. Because of the sharp downturn that had developed in private housing construction, it was appropriate for public housing to be stepped up above original allocations in order to use resources that otherwise may have remained idle. In this situation, the welfare housing advances initially allocated to Victoria for 1974-75 were increased throughout the year and the total represented an increase of 83 per cent on the previous financial year. </para>
            <para>In addition to the new moneys allocated each year to the Home Builders&#39; Account a significant amount becomes available for re-lending through co-operative housing societies from the revolving funds established under the Commonwealth-State housing arrangements that operated prior to the current Agreement. Victoria estimated that some $6m would be available from this source for 1975-76. </para>
            <para>The formation of co-operative housing societies and the allocation of Home Builders&#39; Account moneys to individual societies are matters for the State Government authorities. On the basis of the proposals for 1975-76 submitted by the State Minister in May last, when $53.67m was sought for the Home Builders&#39; Account, it was envisaged that 125 societies would share in the allocation of funds. As yet, I am not able to say how many societies will recieve an allocation, but I have asked the Victorian Minister to provide a revised program in the light of the total allocation of $29.448m for the Home Builders&#39; Account. </para>
            <para>In regard to the level of employment in the building industry, the private sector of the housing industry is now responding and signs of recovery are evident. The upturn in dwelling commencements which first became obvious in the March quarter, was sustained in the June quarter with increases being recorded in all States. Approvals have also increased, though admittedly still remaining below the level of a year ago. Even more encouraging has been the increase in the number of housing loans approved for new dwellings by the banks and especially the permanent building societies in recent months. The moves towards lower interest rates are further welcome signs of an improvement in the situation. I am hopeful therefore that the continued massive support for welfare housing made available by the present Government under the Housing Agreement will assist in the further recovery of the home building industry. </para>
