                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>I rise on a point of order. Standing order 87 provides that no reference shall be made in a petition to any debate in Parliament of the same session. The preceding petition which was lodged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> referred to the Appropriation Bills which are currently before the Senate. They are certainly the subject of debate in the Parliament in this session. The Loan Bill is certainly a Bill which was introduced into the Senate yesterday. I say only that the Standing Orders have a sound basis to them. If petitions of this character are to be permitted, I imagine that the day of the Senate could be taken up with petitions from 30, 40 or 400 people. </para>

              <para>- In response to that interjection, I must say that it is obvious that the Government does not want the truth to come out. That is typical of its tactics. My submission is that the Standing Orders prohibit in their language this type of petition being presented. If the ruling is that they are to be permitted, that is tantamount to inviting petitions of this character to take up the whole day of the Senate, which I am sure is not the intention of the Standing Orders. </para>

              <para>- I speak to the point of order. I think that the practice has been well established that such petitions are received. In fact,  a  number of Opposition senators, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> himself I imagine, have lodged petitions relating to the Australian Government Insurance Corporation Bill, which has been before the Parliament during this session and indeed during this sessional period. The petitions were presented while the Bill was in fact before one or other House of the Parliament. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> himself presented petitions on that very matter. It seems most extraordinary to me that now that the Opposition is in a state of embarrassment, knowing that public feeling is against it, it is attempting to prevent a practice which it followed week after week and day after day in this Senate. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood's</inline> reason for raising this matter is to have you make a decision. It is quite right, as has been stated, that the Senate has received petitions on a number of matters which relate to debates in the current session, but members of the Opposition have knowledge that the Government wishes today to use a great deal of the Senate's time in relation to the presentation of petitions to support its particular argument. It is quite clear in standing order 87 that no reference shall be made in a petition to any debate in Parliament of the same session. There is a great deal of wisdom behind that standing order. I think that that wisdom will be displayed today if and when we hear these petitions presented from the Government side. Government senators have attempted to force onto the Parliament a decision on whether the Senate's action in rejecting or deferring the Appropriation Bills is unconstitutional. That action is within the Senate's power. That many petitions on the subject should be received is obviously contrary to the Standing Orders in the context of the debate. I will be most interested in the decision that will be made by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> as I realise that we have received petitions relating to family law matters and other matters that have been the subjects of debate during sessions of the Parliament. This is a particularly important matter and your ruling will stand for all time. If petitions are allowed to be presented on this subject, they will be allowed to be presented on any other matter which is the subject of debate in the Parliament. </para>

          <para>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. I refer to a letter which was recently published in the newspapers and signed by 4 law professors who claimed that for the Senate to reject an Appropriation Bill would be a constitutional impropriety. Will the Minister confirm that the letter was prepared in the Department of the Attorney-General? Will he confirm that the letter was taken to numerous university professors and academics around Australia by one or more couriers? Will he also confirm that of the law professors and academics to whom that letter was submitted the overwhelming majority refused to sign it; in short, that for the four who did sign it there were many more who refused to sign? Will he make inquiries and state the name of the courier or the names of the couriers who took the letter around and ascertain whether the fares and salaries of those couriers were paid by the Government? Will he also state the full list of names of the persons to whom the letter was submitted so that the people of Australia can have a fair appreciation of what is the legal opinion in the country on this question? </para>

            <para>- It is perfectly true and obviously desirable that competitive forces should be free to influence market prices, subject to any maximum price that the Tribunal considers to be justified in the light of costs and other relevant factors. It would seem that the competitive forces in the food industry are in fact operating in this way. On the other hand, I suggest that it is quite a distortion to say that the PJT in some way obliges manufacturers to charge any higher prices that may be approved. I am advised that the Tribunal necessarily checks with companies to ensure that they are not charging more than the approved price and also to inform itself of the price actually being charged because that information is required by the Tribunal in considering consequential price rises throughout the retail chain. It is true that under the Prices Justification Act approval of a price increase is valid only for a period of 30 days and if it is not availed of by then the company is required under the Act to make a further application in order to charge the increased price. The Tribunal necessarily checks to make sure that this provision is observed, but it in no way seeks to influence companies to charge the higher prices if they do not desire to do so. </para>

            <para>-I will refer that part of the question concerning the Prime Minister's attitude to the Prime Minister. In answering questions asked of me yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> I referred to the Premiers being given advance notice of the Budget and Budget Papers. So that there is no misunderstanding I should say that the Premiers were given details of the matters of direct interest to them and affecting their own responsibilities which were about to be announced in the Budget Speech and Budget Papers. There are some areas, such as general revenue assistance, where details may be settled with the States at a Premiers Conference in advance of the Budget. The States will have knowledge of the funds that will be coming to them through the Budget in such cases. There are other areas where the Budget contains allocations of funds to the States for particular programs of which they may not be aware. It is a matter of courtesy to advise the States in advance of matters of that kind. It is a practice that the Prime Minister has followed. It is entirely proper that the Premiers be given advance notice on matters of that kind. </para>

            <para>-I do not think that any member of the Opposition, in undertaking to block the Budget, has considered the serious implications of that action on our aid commitments to Papua New Guinea. Nearly half of Papua New Guinea's budget comes from Australian aid funds under Appropriation Bill (No. 1), which the Opposition has seen fit to block. The Papua New Guinea Government is already experiencing a constrained financial situation. In the short term the effects of blocking aid to Papua New Guinea will be an inability to pay the salaries of Australian expatriates working in the Papua New Guinea Administration and problems with proceeding with large scale Australian funded projects. In the longer term any sustained delay in the provision of aid funds to Papua New Guinea could place its Government in a position of extreme difficulty in its administration. It is one thing to block the Budget to seek immediate political gain and to satisfy political ambitions. However, those who have rushed into this hasty decision should be reminded- and the people of Australia should be aware- of the many implications of this decision which obviously were not considered when it was made. Among those unthought of results will be the effects upon another country dependent upon Australian aid. </para>

            <para>-1 ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Environment. In the light of 2 disastrous floods in the Murray River within a year, the present flood being the worst on record, when can the report dealing with the control of the Murray River system be expected to be presented to Parliament?

            <para>- As honourable senators will know, the Government has been most concerned with the effects of natural disasters in this country. There has been a number of important initiatives, including the setting up of the Natural Disasters Organisation and the high level coordination of the defence forces in these areas. Concerning the honourable senator's question about the River Murray, I can inform him that a working party was set up some time ago to report on a whole range of problems- pollution, erosion, flooding and environmental aspects- of the River Murray. Its report was submitted this week to the Minister for Environment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Berinson,</inline> and will be considered in depth by a committee of Ministers tomorrow. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Police and Customs. I understand that under tariff quota restraints on imports of bags and sacks of man-made fibre an additional customs duty of 1 8c a bag or sack is being levied on importers who do not have an entitlement to tariff quota. Can the Minister advise the effect which this additional duty is having on the export price of Australian primary produce which is usually shipped in packages of this type? </para>

            <para>-The import duty would have no effect at all on the export of Australian primary produce. There is a tariff on imports of bags and sacks. Importers can get an exemption from payment of customs duty on imports of bags and sacks if they are to be exported at a later date. If the Department of Customs can be satisfied that at the time a sack was exported for the carrying of commodities a customs duty has been paid on it, provision is made for drawbacks by which that duty can be refunded. There are tariff quotas on sacks and bags, but the customs duty is not applied if they are to be exported either immediately or at some subsequent date. </para>

            <para>- I had announced on behalf of the Government before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mcintosh</inline> was appointed to inquire into medical practitioners' fees that the Government would abide by any recommendations which he made, and we intend to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mcintosh</inline> is a reasonable man and I have no reason to believe that the recommendation which he has made, the finding which he has brought down, is anything other than reasonable. In fact, his determination that there should be an increase of 15.6 per cent in doctors' fees over their existing charges, which would amount to a 20.5 per cent increase in toto over the past 12 months, is considerably less than the increase which was asked for by the Australian Medical Association, which was one of 39.9 per cent. In fact, it is only about half of what the doctors were asking for themselves. I do not think that it is fair or appropriate to compare the doctors' fees with wages and salaries. Doctors have to be looked at, I think, as being in the nature of small businessmen insofar as the income which they receive is a gross income and not a net income. The average general practitioner would spend something like 40 per cent to 50 per cent of his gross income on the maintenance of his office or surgery, the payment of the staff, the purchase of equipment and so on. In some instances the percentage could be greater than that. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>So I do not believe that one can regard this increase as a departure from the principles of wage indexation. The increase which has been recommended for the doctors by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mcintosh's</inline> determination, although it exceeds the increases in the consumer price index over the past 12 months, does not exceed them so greatly as to do anything much more, I should think, than compensate for other increases in expenditure in which doctors are involved and in which the ordinary wage or salary earner would not be involved. As I have already said, in fact the increase which he has granted is only approximately half of that which the Australian Medical Association was seeking. </para>

Did the Australian Council of Trade Unions, through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> make representations to the Government on 21 July? Will the Minister inform us whether those representations were related to duties on petrol? Did the parcel of crude oil purchased by ACTUSolo Enterprises Pty Ltd-420 000 barrels- by delivery from the well in July escape the duty on crude oil imposed in August? Did that mean the accrual of an advantage to ACTU-Solo of $840,000? </para>

            <para>-The position is that while the petrol tax was paid at the time of delivery by the oil companies, there has been a change in imposing the excise duty of $2 a barrel of oil. The new duty on oil was payable as from the date of the Budget coming into operation. Of course, we have had many complaints from oil companies because some had exceeded their quota and those which had not taken their full quota were making up their quota at a time when the additional tax on oil was payable. I think that it is unfortunate to make in questions suggestions which show some impropriety on the part of a particular organisation when there may not be any truth in those suggestions. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>No representations were made to me or to any member of the Government in relation to the ACTU oil quota. Therefore, if any concession was given to the ACTU, we as the collecting agent would have had to be notified and we would have had to give the concession. There was never any intention by me or my Department to give concessions to anyone during that period. Whilst I shall obtain the information which the honourable senator seeks, I suggest that it is very unfortunate to make accusations in the form of questions when in all probability there is no truth in the accusations at all. </para>

              <para>- Being an old railway socialist, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> would be pleased with it. As everybody knows, there was a good deal of controversy years ago when licences were given to private operators to install Red telephones. During the period when I was responsible for the Australian Post Office I recommended that we should take over the Red telephones. Some 20 000 units have now been taken over and they all have been converted to take 10c coinage. In addition, there has been a 5 per cent increase in the demand for Red telephones. As recently as in the last eight or nine months there have been 4000 applications from people who want to have Red telephones. </para>

          <para>I suppose that the essential advantage with Red telephones is that they are located in protected positions. The trouble with ordinary public telephones is that they are located in exposed positions and they are subject to much vandalism. The Red telephones have the advantage of being in areas where there are groups of people. It has been a very satisfactory operation. </para>

As I understand it, all the members of the group have returned to Australia except <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunn</inline> who intends to stay longer. As regards the question of aid, which is of particular interest to the members of the group, they are having talks with my staff today. I understand from my staff this morning that one of the preliminary observations that the members of this group have made is that, as the Red Cross has told us, there is a great problem in the distribution of food. In fact as I understand it from the brief talk that I had this morning I will certainly correct this if I am wrong- in some places there are packets of food which are surplus and in other places there is no food at all. The problem is concerned with shifting the food around. Of course, that will apply to any food that goes to Timor, should things worsen there. </para>

The members of this group have confirmed what I think we all know, that if things worsen in Portuguese Timor the distribution of humanitarian aid will become very difficult to handle. The hopeful thing at the moment is that according to my calculations the Portuguese and the Indonesians are due to start talks, if the dateline is correct, on Friday. We have requested both sides to treat those talks very seriously. We have drawn to their attention the seriousness of the situation and have asked them to try to make the talks full scale talks. Hopefully out of that will come further talks which will bring in all the people of the UDT, the Apodeti and the Fret i lin. Our consistent policy all the time has been to try to get Portugal to adopt a more serious attitude to this situation and to get talks going. As I said the other day in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen,</inline> however much we might doubt the efficacy of these talks, the alternative is war. So even with this faint hope that we have, I still think that Australian policy should be aimed at getting these people to talk. Any help that we can offer in that regard we will certainly offer. </para>

            <para>-The matter is presently under investigation. As honourable senators would know, at the present time STD charging equipment is limited to 2 charging scales; that is, day and night rates. However, equipment is being ordered which will enable Telecom Australia to offer up to 5 charging scales. These could be used for special rates, for calls on different days or for calls made during the busier periods of any one day. However, on present indications, that new equipment will not be available for about 2 years. In considering the options, Telecom Australia is concerned that the revenue from the additional calls attracted by reduced rates is not outweighed by the loss of revenue from the diversion of traffic from higher rate periods. The Commission is certainly going to follow up the matter and I will be able to advise later in connection with it. </para>

I remind the Minister that I have asked him a similar question on at least three or four occasions over the past 3 months and that he gave me a series of undertakings to get early answers. Does the Minister now have detailed answers to my questions? If not, what are the obstacles in the way of such answers? Will he state categorically that such persons, as refugees, will be regarded as refugees under Australia's commitment under the International Treaty on Refugees? Are persons from Laos and Cambodia also capable of claiming refugee status and, if so, why is the Minister's Department currently acting to terminate the residence in Australia of a number of people from Laos? </para>

I ask the Minister: Do not these reports confirm previous reports from newsmen, aid groups, Red Cross doctors and parliamentary visits that the Fret i lin movement represents the overwhelming view of the Timorese people and that Indonesia is actively involved in the fighting? I refer also to the question asked of the Minister a week ago about the 5 Australians lost a fortnight ago near the Indonesian border but in Portuguese Timor. Is it not now apparent that these men, in pursuit of the truth about the current war in Portuguese Timor, have lost their lives? What is the current position about inquiries into the cause of the deaths of these brave men and is there any truth in the consistent reports that the Australians were shot by either Indonesian troops or Indonesian backed troops and then their bodies burnt? Will the Minister demand the return of these bodies so that the cause of their untimely death can be determined properly? </para>

            <para>-Regarding the return of bodies, I would think that the next-of-kin would have the prime say on that. These people have gone through a terrible time and, as far as I am concerned, the question of the return of the bodies would be left to them. On the question of the missing newsmen, I had hoped by now to have definitive information on the fate of the 5 missing newsmen but I regret that this information is not yet to hand. I recognise that this is a tragic situation for the next-of-kin, who will not wish to give up hope until the fate of their sons and husbands is confirmed. But I have to say that I have no encouraging words in that regard. All the information we have been able to assemble indicates that the 5 missing journalists were among those killed in the fighting which took place in the town of Balibo on 15 and 16 October. Documents apparently found at the scene of the fighting and which we expect to receive shortly are said to have belonged to the missing newsmen. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government recognises that there has been a number of disturbing accounts of the circumstances in which the 5 newsmen may have met their deaths. A Fret i lin soldier interviewed by the media in Deli yesterday is reported to have described the entry of the anti Fret i lin forces into Balibo. He spoke in terms of a considerable amount of firing as the anti Fret i lin forces advanced on the town and he described the efforts of the 5 newsmen to signal their neutral status to the advancing forces. Other reports suggest that the 5 newsmen took shelter in a house which was subject to a direct hit by a mortar barrage. That a heavy bombardment of Balibo took place has been confirmed by Fret i lin spokesmen. There are also reports that the house in which the newsmen reportedly took shelter and of which photographs appeared in the Press a day or two ago was used to store fuel supplies. This may account for the suggestion that the interior of the house was quickly enveloped by fire. But in fact the Government cannot be certain about any of these reports. </para>
          <para>Efforts to have an on the spot investigation carried out have not proved successful. On the one hand, access to Balibo through Deli is not practicable at this time. On the other hand, the Indonesian-Portuguese Timor border has been closed, preventing access through Indonesian Timor. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Johnson,</inline> the consular officer we have sent to Indonesian Timor, is still in Huang but thus far has been unable to travel to the border areas. Nor have our efforts to contact the UDT, Apodeti and Kota forces yet yielded a definitive result. One problem is the hostility with which Australia appears to be held by some of the anti Fret i lin leaders. There appears to be an impression that Australia through its relief program has shown support for the Fret i lin forces. Reports given currency by Portuguese sources in Atari and Macao a week or two ago that Australians were assisting Fret i lin forces militarily have also had a damaging effect in this regard. As I indicated in my statement of 1 7 October the Government will continue, of course, its most strenuous efforts to obtain final and authoritative information on the missing newsmen. We are making further efforts to enlist the good offices of the Indonesian Government in allowing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Johnson</inline> to visit the border area in an effort to make direct contact with the anti Fret i lin leaders. We are trying to ascertain again whether it would be possible to make a direct visit to Balibo. I feel bound to note, however, that as long as the fighting in the border areas continues, and in the absence of direct word from the anti Fret i lin forces, the prospects for an early and final resolution of this matter are not good. </para>

But as yet the report has not been prepared. 1 am told that we can expect to see it at some time in the near future, although what precisely is meant by the near future I am not altogether clear. I know that a number of people are becoming concerned about this report. I was at the Returned Services League Congress a couple of days ago, where some concern was shown about this matter. But I am afraid there is nothing more that I can do about the matter other than to wait for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toose to present his report, which we have now been awaiting so long. </para>

            <para>-This subject has been raised more than once in this place. As the honourable senator knows quite well, the Government's advisers have pointed out that no such damage has occurred at all as a result of resignations. As I think everybody now knows, the real position is that those resignations took place because this Government acted upon the recommendations of the Jess report, which the Opposition would not do when it was in government. As a result benefits were afforded to officers to retire sooner than they might have done. Certainly no damage has been caused or problem created within the defence services. In fact, the reverse has happened. In the last week or so the Minister for Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Morrison,</inline> has been advised that retention rates within the Services generally might have to be looked at because of the $1,000 bonuses which our Government provided for servicemen. It is thought that promotions might be slowed down because of serving members wanting to stay in the services. If the honourable senator has any other questions on any other aspects which he wants answered I shall certainly attempt to obtain an answer from the Minister. </para>

          <para class="block">Whether or not the price of aviation fuel to international carriers will be increased is, of course, a question in the first instance for my colleague the Minister for Minerals and Energy, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, to consider. I would assume it would then be a matter for determination by Cabinet, and this would make it a matter of Government policy. But so far as the Prices Justification Tribunal is concerned, firstly, as an export price would be involved the jurisdiction of the Prices Justification Tribunal would not extend to any increases in the prices of aviation fuel that is supplied to international carriers. Secondly, should such prices be increased the revenue of the suppliers would be increased also. Whilst certainly the Government would not seek to influence the Prices Justification Tribunal in its handling of its business, it having the authority given it by law, nonetheless I believe it would be reasonable to expect the Tribunal to take into account the changed circumstances in considering any future proposals that are put to the Tribunal by companies in relation to the domestic price of their product. </para>

What is the total expenditure on the aforementioned houses by the Department? How many houses or properties were purchased? How many Aborigines have benefited as a direct result of these purchases? What responsible Aboriginal organisations will have the management and control of these properties? Why does the Federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs continue to accede to the demands of the radical element of the Aboriginal community when there are so many Aboriginal families in need of housing and direct assistance? Lastly, will the Minister consult his departmental head in Queensland to ensure that the responsible but unfortunate sections of the Aboriginal community which are in such grave need will be given as much consideration as are those who use radical and unorthodox means to achieve their needs? </para>

            <para>-It must be realised that I am representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I do not know the details of the number of houses that have been bought as a result of any action. Therefore I suggest that the honourable senator put his question on notice. The honourable senator suggests that there has been a cave-in to militant groups within the Aboriginal community. This is not so. Many times as a result of some militant action something is done about a matter because the actions of individuals have highlighted the problem sufficiently for the Department to appreciate that something should be done. When Aborigines have to go to such an extent as sitting-in to focus attention on their grievances, if their grievances are justified the Department will do everything possible to try to rectify them. It is unfair to suggest that only militant elements get assistance from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs because in the last 2 years in Queensland more houses have been provided for Aboriginal people- that is across the whole range of Aboriginals throughout Queensland- than ever before in history. </para>

            <para>- I dare say that one factor, as much as anything else, which has served to prevent the success of the wool floor price scheme has been the manner in which the Government's policy decision to support the market during the 1 975-76 season has been used as a political weapon, as I have said here many times, by those who seek a political advantage in Australia to the detriment of our overseas market position. It is true that a statement has been made about the possibility of devaluation. That is a matter for the Treasurer. The question of devaluation is a hypothetical one for it is not under consideration. Certainly overseas buyers who thought for one moment that there may be a devaluation of the Australian currency might seek to hold up their purchases in order to benefit from such a devaluation but that is not the position here because the Government does not propose any such move. As to the current position of the market, it has been down but there are signs of improved demand over the past week and I understand that this week the Australian Wool Corporation was required to buy in only 20 per cent of the clip. That, of course, is a distinct improvement on the 30 per cent which it has been buying in for some weeks. </para>

            <para>- I have read the report to which the honourable senator refers and the passage which he has quoted, and I would agree that the attitude of trade unionists to migrants leaves a lot to be desired. Of course, this is true of most institutions in the country. I would imagine that the Australian Medical Association, for example, would hardly be a paragon of virtue in its attitude towards doctors from other countries. This in no way condones or justifies the shortcomings of the unions. I point out in this regard that this Government has set up a trade union training centre, something which our opponents talked about for years but never got around to. We have set up this trade union training centre. Unfortunately, in the conditions of Budget stringency which apply this year, we have not been able to devote as much money as we would have liked to the scheme. But that would be one of the aspects to which this training system would advert. So, in answer to the honourable senator's question, I would say that the trade unions, like the rest of the community, do not accord to migrants the treatment which they deserve. I hope that this Government will be able to do something to improve that position. </para>

            <para>- My question is virtually supplementary to that asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> and, of course, is directed to the Minister for Labor and Immigration. By way of preface I refer to the proceedings of Estimates Committee Fat which I asked for further information on an innovation suggested to the Government via <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Robinson for the printing of many awards in foreign languages. My question is: Are we accelerating the practice of having, as far as possible, awards and safety regulations printed on at least a bi-lingual basis in areas such as the motor car industry in which there is a high ethnic content? </para>

            <para>- It has been a matter of my own observation that, so far as safety notices are concerned, it is the practice of most companies involved in areas in which there are any industrial dangers to have safety notices printed in several languages. The proposition as to awards is more difficult. I should think that the cost of publishing awards in languages other than English would be prohibitive. However, I will take up the matter with my Department to see whether it is possible to do something along the lines suggested by the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- In accordance with the announcement by my colleagues the Minister for Overseas Trade and the Minister for Manufacturing Industry, certain items of apparel from some Asian countries, including Hong Kong, were subject to voluntary restraint. That was for the purpose of protecting Australian industry. But it was found necessary to specify the particular goods under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations as some goods were being diverted through a third country for the purpose of overcoming the voluntary restraints that the other countries had imposed. The specific goods that are subject to this restraint can be passed through customs provided they are accompanied by a certificate from the relevant authority in the exporting country. So the reason was to counter the overcoming of the restraints by a third country coming into the position. </para>

            <para>-As I said before, all those who purchased petrol on or after the prescribed date for the operation of the new petrol tax had to pay the extra duty. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> or ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd took delivery of crude oil from the refinery after that date they paid the increased duty, just as anyone else did. I take it that the honourable senator's question is whether that company had sufficient knowledge of the imposition of the tax on oil to permit it to take delivery of its oil prior to the date of operation of the tax and so receive a windfall. I do not know. No representations were made to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> or by anyone from the Australian Council of Trade Unions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> asked whether representations were made to the Government. I think possibly the Treasurer would be the person to whom I should refer this question. I can give an assurance that no representations were made to me as the head of the agency which has to collect the tax. I cannot say whether representations were made to someone else. If there is any information that can be obtained in the first instance, I shall refer the question to the Treasurer to see whether he can affirm or give some response to what the honourable senator is suggesting or whether he will make some direct denial. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Special Minister of State. Over recent weeks the Minister has advised the Senate of the steps that have been taken to establish an interim advisory council for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. In answer to a recent question the Minister said he was hopeful that the council's first meeting would be held just after the middle of October. I ask the Minister whether the first meeting of the interim council has been held and, if so, whether it was productive and whether it was held with the co-operation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunies-Ross?</inline></para>

            <para>-The advice tendered to me on the matter is that because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunies-Ross</inline> was unwilling to sanction a meeting of the interim advisory council on Home Island- that is the one occupied by the Cocos-Malay community in the Cocos Island group- the meeting was held on West Island where the Australian administrative officers are located. All those people whom I invited to serve as members of the interim advisory council attended the first meeting. The Administrator reported to me that the meeting, in his opinion, was highly successful. He has advised that the atmosphere was good and that all members actively contributed to the discussion on a great number of subjects involving and related to the welfare of the Cocos-Malay community. </para>

          <para>- We are dealing with a message sent to the Senate from the House of Representatives concerning Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1975-76 and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1975-76. It makes assertions which, to say the least, need to be very highly qualified. It makes the assertion that the delaying of the passage of these Bills, of itself, is contrary to the established constitutional convention. This debate is becoming something of a movable feast. Before I deal with the material of this debate I, on behalf of the Opposition, move the following amendment to the message: </para>

I think we ought to have regard to that in this place where we are safeguarding democracy where we are exercising our proper rights and responsibilities and where we would be totally negligent were we not to do so. A lot of talking has been going on. I have referred to this before and no doubt it will be referred to again by many of my colleagues.

            <para>-Why does not the Minister go out and ask him? He might buy the Minister a cup of tea. It has been known to happen. He offered to buy me one. I believe that the Government is engaged in a conspiracy to remain in office. In its engagement in that conspiracy it is receiving some very solid assistance from media organisations under its own control. I suppose that one of the most alarming things to happen in the last couple of days has been the revealing of the disclosure to the  President  of the Australian Labor Party of the facts of the Budget some 6 hours before they were known to the Parliament. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue><para>We all know the situation. There is a lock-up arrangement under which the people of the Press who are concerned to know about this matter are locked in and cannot get out until the Treasurer has delivered his speech. Some reference has been made to the fact that the Premiers had access to the Budget documents. This is not a fact. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> very properly laid down the information that the Premiers receive a few hours before the presentation of the Budget. This is very restricted. But to have the  president  of a political party privy to Budget Speech detail some 6 hours before its presentation is, to say the least, one of the most disgraceful and reprehensible pieces of behaviour of any government in any democracy for quite a long time. 1 hope that all Government senators realise the dreadful position in which this places <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke.</inline> I am glad that I am not in his position. I would not have taken advantage of the opportunity under any circumstances if it were given to me. A person placed in this dreadful position could be accused of having an opportunity to profit against excise, to have made some gains in share transactions on stock exchanges in London, Perth and Tokyo because of the different hours of opening and of profiting from exchange revaluations on the overnight money markets. It was totally improper for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> to engage in this situation and equally, I think, unfortunate for his party to place him in it. Any government of probity and integrity would not behave in this fashion. If there were no other reason for the Government to put itself to the people- indeed to resign- it could be found in this circumstance. </para><para>Very slight irregularities in the United Kingdom resulted in 2 Treasurers resigning. This happened in almost minimal circumstances. I think that in the case of Dalton or Thomas the resignation came because of a chance observation to a journalist as the Treasurer went into the House of Commons to make his speech at the dispatch box. He was called upon to resign by the Prime Minister and very properly so. To me, this action by the Government is not only shabby but also is extremely sad. I have some regard for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and his ability. I think that he is a man who has tried to do his best in certain areas. I totally disagree with some of the things that he believes in and does.  His  judgment was odious in allowing himself to be placed in that position. The people who put him in that position should be, to say the least, ashamed of themselves. </para><para>Perhaps we are looking also at a small extension of the reasoning as to why these Bills ought to be deferred and as to why the Government ought to go to the people. We have been arguing this for quite a long time. With every day that goes by the facts of our economic arguments and our arguments in regard to the Government's incompetence and deceit are borne out more and more. For instance, we are looking at a situation in which the economic problems of the Government are coming to a head. We referred to the latest loan result this morning. Again <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> gave a completely accurate answer on this matter. The fact of life is that the loan has been filled by the Government printing its own money in a money supply expansion situation. There has been no real money move from traditional savings areas, which are in a state of massive expansion into the government area. This demonstrates above all other things that the people of Australia have no confidence in the ability of the Government to run the country properly and to safeguard their savings. Therefore they are keeping those savings in the safest place. That is a great demonstration of the actual position of the Government. </para><para>I referred yesterday to the state of the Government's overdraft. I said that at the end of September it was standing at around $2,250m. I dealt with the run down of the Government's cash balances. Its position is one in which at the end of October it raised a loan, in effect, by lending money to itself. This sort of action, without any doubt, will just add to the destruction of confidence in this Government and its ability to handle the affairs of the Australian people. </para><para>Added to this position we have the overseas loans matter. The information on this is not yet fully available for us to make total judgments but the position begins to take on increasingly alarming and dangerous trends. When one sets the comments by the Government in answer to questions raised on the Loan Bills- that no overseas loans were going to be raised and that there was no intention to raise them- against the recital of facts it is seen that we simply are faced with a massive conspiracy of deceit. The ACTU-Solo affair has yet to be fully cleared up and ventilated. Again, it has some very shabby overtones. </para><para>In fact, I believe that we are seeing in Australia the progressive building up of what I might call a Dreyfus case, and the Australian people are beginning to say: 'J 'accuse'. Why would they not? We are looking at expansions of the money supply by the Government which are getting to dangerous levels. By doing this the Government is going to add further to inflationary pressures which will add to unemployment. I believe that we really have a monstrous Government. It is incapable, yet it is determined to hang on to office at any possible cost. I do not think Australia will see any real recovery or any real remedy until this Government goes to the people and is removed. We have a supreme contest in the Government between the untruth area, the deception area and the dismissal area. But these things are known to all honourable senators. Nobody would question that the Labor Party has within its ranks some very fine and some very good people. They must be feeling very sad for the Government for which they had such high hopes when they elected it. I think there is a responsibility upon the Senate, clearly part of the Australian Parliament- very clearly that, and not to be dismissed or set aside by some Prime Minister who has delusions of grandeur- to persist in its endeavour to send this Government to the people. The Government has a like responsibility to go to the people. </para>

          <para>- The longer that this constitutional crisis persists the deeper and more permanent will be the wounds that it inflicts on the fragile system of parliamentary democracy. I repeat what I have said and what other speakers on this side of the Senate have said throughout this crisis: The issue is not the economy; the issue is the survival of parliamentary democracy. No matter how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> or the lawyers whom he quotes may try to twist the words of the Constitution there is no doubt that it was not contemplated that a government in a moment of unpopularity could be thrown out by an unrepresentative Senate. Let me repeat again that this Senate is an unrepresentative House compared with the House of Representatives. It is necessary to contemplate only one simple point, and that is that 10 senators come here from the State of Tasmania which has 400 000 inhabitants and 10 senators come here from the State of New South Wales which has 5 million inhabitants. So it is certainly stretching all of the known concepts of democracy to suggest that this is a House which is as representative of the will of the people as is the House of Representatives. </para>

They, of course, are always intent on grabbing for power because they have never been able to resign themselves to the fact that their snouts were pulled out of the pig trough.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline>today, unfortunately, I was disappointed, seemed to think that he could reduce this matter to which the whole of Australia is paying attention to a contest between lawyers. With less than admirable selectivity he chose a couple of lawyers who happened to support his side. It was odd to hear an orthodox Liberal praising <inline font-weight="bold">Mr St</inline> John. Nonetheless, he chose to do so this morning. He used extravagant language to suggest that what the Government is trying to do is to smash the power of the Senate. This reminds me of nothing more than a rapist accusing his victim of the crime. After all, we know where this matter was initiated. Why is it that money is not being supplied for essential services? Is it due to anything that this Government has done? I am afraid that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> and other honourable senators on the Opposition side have not got the message yet from the grass roots, they will soon get it. The public outside do not regard this as a matter of what one lawyer says about the constitutionality of the matter and what another lawyer says about the unconstitutionality of the matter. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> have a look at the gallup poll which is published in today's Bulletin. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition is in front. I suggest, though, that honourable senators opposite are going out backwards. They do not want to look just at the figures for today. They want to have a look at the movements of figures. That is the only significance which gallup polls have. If we accept this gallup poll- I take it that the Opposition accepts the validity of these gallup polls- it shows that from a high of 60 per cent in July the Opposition is now down to 50 per cent. In the same period the Government's popularity has risen from its low point of 33 per cent to 43 per cent. That is in a period of two or three months. What is the explanation for this? The economy has not improved in that time. Every day we hear from the Opposition that the economy is getting worse. Yet we get this significant movement. If we take the personal popularity of the 2 Leaders we note that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> 's popularity has risen to a figure of 37 per cent and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser's</inline> has declined from a figure of 52 per cent on the weekends of 6 and 1 3 September to 34 per cent. </para>

In a period when there has been no real uplift in the economy, when, according to the Opposition, the economy has declined, its standing and its Leader's standing in the community has deteriorated to that extent. This should be a clear warning to the Opposition that if this situation which it has engineered is allowed to persist it will be only a matter of a few weeks before we are ahead on the polls. The net result of the Opposition's gambit will have been to have turned around the political situation in this country most dramatically. If this is what the Opposition is seeking to do, so be it. I suggest that the Opposition has been taken completely by surprise by the feelings which have been expressed by the Australian people about its unprecedented and immoral conduct. </para>
        <para>If we are to have a contest of lawyers, I point out that another lawyer cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> was a certain <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gruzman.</inline> I can only assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> thinks that the man one would hire to defend one on a murder charge is the man who is best qualified to construe the Constitution. As any lawyer will tell the honourable senator, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gruzman</inline> is noted more as counsel for the financial desperado Alexander Barton than for any performance in the field of constitutional law. I have been similarly saddened at the progressive deterioration of another man for whom I have always had a great deal of respect, and that is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott. Mr Ellicott</inline> came into this Parliament with excellent credentials. He had been a leading barrister and a Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth and I had thought of him always as a man of temperate, moderate and sensible views. However, ever since this contest has blown up he has deteriorated not only as a parliamentarian but also as a lawyer. He took it upon himself to issue gratuitous advice to the Governor-General which was out of tune with anything I have read from any constitutional lawyer and which does not stand up to examination in the light of the sections of the Constitution which he was attempting to construe. </para>
        <para>He says in effect that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> refuses to hold a double dissolution, the Governor-General should dismiss <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> from office. This is turning the clock back to the times before we had representative and responsible government. This is an assertion of a power in the Crown which has long been ceded. If we are to turn this into a contest of lawyers, though I suggest that this is a most unreal way to approach it and if the Opposition persists in that approach it will lead to its ruin, then I suggest that we should look at the opinions of all lawyers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> embarked on a smear of the professors who had written expressing their views a little earlier. He attempted to depict this as something which had been engineered by the Government. It was a false statement and one for which I suggest he has no evidence at all. If we are to look at the opinions of lawyers, why not look at what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Eggleston had to say? Any lawyer in this House knows that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Eggleston is easily the most distinguished lawyer, and I include <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, who has bought into this argument. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Eggleston in a most closely reasoned statement which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> this week expressed the opinion that what has been done by this Senate in deferring the Opposition does not like the word 'reject'these Bills is unconstitutional. </para>

            <para>- I suggest that if we are to have the benefit of all the lawyers' lucubrations we should have a contribution from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> in his own right a little later rather than have him try to convert the Senate by interjection. So if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> will bear with me I will proceed with my argument and will look forward to hearing from him a little later. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> in his lust for power, in his desire to get off the back bench and get a guernsey as a Minister as soon as possible, has deteriorated even as a politician. We saw him in the ludicrous situation yesterday saying about the Khemlani papers in the middle of the day that they did not provide any ground for imputing that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> had been involved in any misleading of the Senate or had taken any part in any attempted loan raisings since 20 May and then coming back to Canberra, being dressed down by his leader, eating his own words and, presumably without having seen any other documents, giving a totally contrary view of the situation. If there is any victim of this crisis it surely is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott. His</inline> reputation is in ruins and, I regret, that is something that does make me sad. I suggest that the sooner <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> reverts to the previous high standards he set both as a lawyer and as a politician for which he won the respect of the people of this country the better it will be for his reputation, the better it will be for his Party and the better it will be for the country. </para>

        <para>Evidently, as far as I could gather from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> today, the ground has changed since the last deferral of these Bills. On that occasion we heard a great deal about the scandal of the loans matter. That was the real <inline font-style="italic">casus belli.</inline> That was the ground that the Opposition had for saying that this was a disreputable and reprehensible Government. Honourable senators will recall the orchestration of the previous arrival of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> Much was made at that time about the great disclosures that were to be expected from him. It was against that background that the Opposition took this extraordinary step. But today we did not hear much about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> I think his name was mentioned once. Instead it was suggested that the new reprehensible conduct was that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> in allowing a briefing of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> before the Budget was announced. </para>

            <para>-No, I do not. I think that that was a mistake. I think it was an honest mistake. If honourable senators study the comment in the newspapers around this country, which have not been notably kind to this Government during the period of this crisis, I think they will find that most of them have taken the same view. They upbraid <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> for what he has done and they disapprove of it, but they have the position in perspective. None of the newspapers- not even the most rabid newspaper- that I have read, including the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald's</inline> editorial this morning, has suggested that what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> did was reprehensible enough to ground the conduct which the Senate is indulging in at the present time. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>An attempt has also been made to get a new reprehensible circumstance in the facts of the ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd deal, but try as it may the Opposition has not been able to get any mileage out of this matter. It makes one wonder why, if the Opposition really wants to get to the bottom of the matter, it does not apply to the Royal Commission which is sitting at present and offer what evidence, as against the vituperation, it has to offer to clear up this matter. It is being used shamelessly as an attempt to smear this Government and I predict that after a while it will turn out to be a fizzer, as the Khemlani matter has turned out to be a fizzer. If one is going to be sad, if one is going to use the word sad ', it is too obvious to need stressing that there is a great sadness in the ranks of the Opposition today at having fallen on its face over the Khemlani matter. There was a great fanfare and beating of drums at the end of last week when it was known that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was to arrive with the goods. This was to be the clincher to prove that the Prime Minister has misled the Parliament, that he had been up to his ears in loan raisings since 20 May. In other words, the Opposition was going to pin him to the mast. </para>
        <para>Of course, so sure were we that nothing of the kind would eventuate that when I received a request from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> 's attorneys in New York on Friday night to give him a visa to come here I had no hesitation in telling them that he could have a visa. He chose to arrive without one but the Government did not take any steps to throw him out. We have given the Opposition abundant time to call him. The legal experts of the Opposition have been closeted with him for hours and have examined the contents of the suitcases that he brought. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> in his more open moment, was obliged to confess that he had come away empty-handed. What do we have left out of the great Khemlani scandal? The Leader of the Opposition in this place had been inviting </para>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline>to appear before the Senate and had repeatedly said last week: 'We will offer him the facilities of the Senate. He will have every opportunity to tell the Senate what he has got'. What did we see from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> today? We saw a most despicable backdown. We saw that he was not proposing to call <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> All he has put down is a face-saving formula about a select committee, which he hinted at the same time is to be nothing more than a face saving formula about which we will probably hear very little more. </para>
        <para>I suggest to the Opposition that it is not too late for it to turn back. I suggest that, among other things, it should read an excellent letter which appeared in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman</inline> Cowper, for whom I would suggest that any man in New South Wales could not have anything but the greatest respect. He is not a socialist. He is not a radical. He was the best known and most respected lawyer in New South Wales for many years as the head of one of our leading firms of solicitors. He was a most active man. I should not use the word 'was' because fortunately he is still with us. He is a man who has taken a keen interest in public affairs. He was the Director of the Australian Institute of Political Science. He has written a letter which appeared in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> which I commend to all honest members opposite. He is not a man whom one would expect to be putting an argument in favour of the Government. He discussed the possibilities facing the country at present. I am not suggesting that what I am about to quote is exhaustive. If anybody wants me to table a copy of the letter, I will. He said: </para>

        <para>Once again I commend to honourable senators opposite a careful reading of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman's</inline> suggestions. I suggest that this will snap them out of the corner into which they appear to have painted themselves and will convince them that it is not too late to pull back. It may be said that to change one's mind in politics and to confess to error is a humiliating experience, but I suggest that the public is not concerned so much with the face of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> the face of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> or the face of any of us as it is with a sensible solution to the problem. Obviously the public disapproves the Opposition's action. The figures, the attendances at meetings- no matter how an attempt is made to denigrate what happens at those meetings- and, I am sure, the word of mouth which Opposition senators must hear must convince them that they have made a grievous error which is disapproved by the public, and if they persist in that error they will be harming not only <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> and their parties but also will be inflicting irreparable damage on the country. I suggest that if they examine all those indices they can form no conclusion but that they are on the wrong path and that they are exacerbating the problems of the economy to which they are constantly pointing. I suggest that it is time for them to take stock of their position, to retreat and to do the sensible thing which the people of Australia expect of them. </para>

            <para>- If you disapprove I hope it will be possible for you to bring the facts to the Senate instead of repeating the constant proposition which is put to the Senate that it is the Opposition which must pursue and bring up the facts. That is one of the problems which has faced the Opposition over past years. These most scurrilous actions- actions which constitute an absolute breach of convention and could be described as constituting a breach of the Constitutionhave been taken illegally. It is notable, I think, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, who is a senior Minister, now joins <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> today and deplores the actions of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> in giving special treatment- probably because he is the leader of the Australian Labor </para>

        <para class="block">Party- to a company director, a company entrepreneur, a man involved in so many areas of business by advising him of the contents of the Budget in advance. </para>
        <para>I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland when he says that there has been some disturbance in the public mind in relation to whether the Opposition has acted correctly in deferring the Appropriation Bills. I must say that I have received a number of telegrams from unions and other groups which, from their names, I recognise as being opposed to anything that the Liberal Party does. Those telegrams have come across my desk, and I would expect that the organisations sending them would oppose the action the Opposition has taken. Along with other members of the Opposition I was impressed by the views expressed by some legal men who wrote to the newspapers and suggested that what the Opposition was doing was unconstitutional. 1 agree that the attitude taken by some sectors of the public, namely that what the Opposition was doing was unconstitutional, was in the first place inflamed by the immediate statement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> to the effect that the Senate was acting unconstitutionally. That statement was supported by Professor Howard and Gareth Evans, senior lecturer in law at Melbourne University. Only a few legal opinions which found their way into the newspapers said that the Senate was acting unconstitutionally. </para>
        <para>I doubt whether today any one of those individuals would echo those words, that the action of the Senate was unconstitutional. Indeed, one or two of those earlier named gentlemen have been diverting a little from that proposition and saying that whilst the Senate may have acted constitutionally there was an impropriety; but that was a political decision. The Prime Minister misled the people, and in the first flush of his statement there was a reaction by the public that the Senate may not have acted constitutionally. That is not a fact. The Senate acted absolutely within its rights. I do not think that anyone today would say that the Senate had acted unconstitutionally. One is able to gain from reading section 53 of the Constitution the understanding thai: quite clearly the Senate in actual fact has the right to defer or reject a money Bill. There is now massive and impeccable authority to support the Senate's veto power. For example, Quick and Garran in their work on the Constitution state that the Senate has co-ordinate power with the House of Representatives to pass all Bills or to reject all Bills. That is the basic fact of what the Constitution says, and nobody would say otherwise. But it was a political decision. </para>

          <para>In doing this the Opposition is pursuing a tradition which is well established, but in view of some doubt recently cast on it by this chamber, perhaps I should restate the position. The Senate is entitled and expected to exercise resolutely but with discretion its power to refuse its concurrence to any financial measure, including a tax Bill. There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its constitutional powers, except the limitations imposed by discretion and reason. The Australian Labor Party has acted consistently in accordance with the tradition that we will oppose in the Senate any tax or money Bill or other financial measure whenever necessary to carry out our principles and policies. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Why did a senior Minister say in this chamber today that the Opposition is acting unconstitutionally? It is the word 'unconstitutionally' that concerns me. It is interesting to note that at that time former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> listed 168 money Bills against which the Labor Party had voted and, as both the present Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> said, they hoped that the Government would resign. </para>
        <para>One of the problems facing the Opposition is that this Prime Minister just will not resign when the facts are presented to him that he should do so. That is not a constitutional crisis; it is a political crisis. In this matter I have considered the writing of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Eggleston, whom I regard as something of an authority in certain areas of law, although certainly not on constitutional matters. He has influenced a number of my friends on this matter and he is a man held in very high regard. In his comments <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> dealt with messages between the Senate and the House of Representatives, and he did not deal with the theory that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies had put forward when he said that the Senate had the absolute power to deny money Bills to the House of Representatives. If ever there was a situation presented to the Opposition that it should deny the Government Supply, surely it is this situation. I support fully the Opposition's action, and my concern, built up over 3 years of Labor office, is not related purely to the rejection of a money Bill but to the fact that this country is being sold out to a political ideology which I abhor in the context of the Australia that I knew. </para>
        <para>An article by Graham Hutton, which I would recommend the public to read, headed 'The English Disease- and is it Catching?', indicates well the problems into which Australia is running under a Labor Government. He states that behind Britain's alarming economic and social malaise are a variety of situations which can be likened to Australia.  His  article warns Australia that it is already infected with the English disease which, if not arrested, leads to an authoritarian state. He continues:   the disease is most marked by inflation, because the State or public sector expands its ' take ' year by year from the national output faster than its revenues grow (taxes, social security contributions, etc.); so it runs year-to-year deficits . . . </para>
        <para class="block">That is the basic problem that has arisen under these Appropriation Bills. Could any person with any derrick of business ability say that an officer in charge, whether it be an officer of a company or of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> 's ACTU-Solo business, could come before a board and say: 'Here is a program under which this year we will have a deficit of $5, $500 or $500'. What would happen if at the end of the year that officer in charge said: 'We did not achieve those figures. I am afraid that we are in deficit by 5 times that amount. We are in deficit by $2,500m'. What would happen if that same officer were to start the next year by saying: </para>
        <para class="block">Our capabilities are nil. Our company is now bankrupt. What we intend to do with this 1 975-76 Budget is to start a year with a proposed deficit of $2.600m'. Within a week of that statement being made by this Government we had the total Budget laid bare and false by the statements of a Minister in this House that unemployment will accelerate to 400 000 in this year with all the problems that go with it. There have been changes in the Budget, withdrawals of certain tax measures, and the application of other costs that have been added. It is the financial proposals of this Government, the crazy, hare-brained schemes of a Labor socialist government, that have put me of the view that this Government should go immediately to the people. </para>

It is stated on the financial pages of every newspaper in the country that business confidence is at a low, that unemployment is growing and that there will be no business recovery. I do not doubt that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh),</inline> who interrupted me a moment ago, would wish to see a statement shortly to the effect that because private enterprise cannot cope with unemployment and cannot see to the growth of its business, government enterprise is proposed.

        <para>During the hearing of the relevant Senate Estimates Committee we examined the attempted investments and investments of the Petroleum and Minerals Authority on behalf of this country in no liability mining companies. In my view, it has done so illegally. We saw the stupidity of the investment of our money in various companies by the Government to develop mineral proposals. This is the most stupid and idiotic thing that any group of men could do. But today we- the Australian people- are shareholders through our investment in companies such as Mareeba Mining No Liability. I would have thought that there is absolutely no convention or right for the Commonwealth to invest in such a proposal but we have seen that occur. Where else will the Government invest our money? Again, the Government said that it would invest in the development, of minerals and the search for oil by the purchase of the floating oil rig <inline font-style="italic">Ocean Endeavour.</inline> But we find that the Government's activities are such that it has removed that opportunity for investment. The owners of that oil rig are now seeking work for it overseas. The reason for the opposition to this measure goes back to the Gair affair, the attempted bribing of a senator, as he was at that time. </para>

As a matter of fact, I wish to make a comment on this matter. The standard of language in debate recently has got to the stage at which a very drastic check has to be taken. There has been intemperate, extravagant and exaggerated language used during the debates. I will clamp down on it in the future much more than I have in the past. I ask honourable senators to use their good judgment in the choice of language. When the records of the Parliament during this period are read, people will be absolutely surprised at some of the exaggerated language that has been used. I ask the honourable senator to observe the usual practice with regard to his description of other members of the Parliament. </para>

        <para class="block">There are very sound reasons for our taking our action. I referred in my earlier remarks to the economic considerations, the promises made by Labor relating to employment and the newspaper reports that endorse the comments of the Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, that we are likely to have 400 000 people unemployed the highest on record. Surely this is of concern to the Government. Surely it recognises that its policies over these years have not worked. Are we as a community to sit down and accept an unemployment situation such as that? It is not good enough for this country. Action is needed. Are we readily going to accept that there will be an inflation rate of 1 5, 20 or 25 per cent after the stability that we had in previous years? Let us not accept that this situation should exist. The policies of this Labor Government have brought it about. They have brought about lack of confidence in the business community and the lack of confidence in those who would attempt to build homes. A news report that I saw today indicates that the average person attempting to buy a home will find that over 50 per cent of his pay packet will be needed for repayments. We know there have been deliberate attempts to sap the confidence of all sectors of the community by massive government domination. </para>

There is the matter of the benefit given by a ministerial decision to ACTUSolo Enterprises Pty Ltd- a basic arm of this Government- to receive millions of dollars at the disadvantage of others in the community. Does allowing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> to have a preview of the Budget seem reasonable and fair? Apparently it is approved by the Government. Both those matters are approved by the Government. But I do not think that is good enough for this community. Then there is the third matter- the matter that has the headlines today- the loans arrangement, whereby that most improper, unconstitutional and illegal action was taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and three of his Ministers on 13 December last year when they signed a document which said that they intended to borrow $4,000m for temporary purposes. I believe that by some means they induced the Governor-General to sign that particular document. </para>

          <para>- These Bills have been returned to the Senate because the amendment carried by the Opposition is unacceptable to the House of Representativesthe people's House. And rightly so. I reckon it would be about the most irresponsible amendment that ever came out of this Senate. The House of Representatives- the people's House; the only House that can form a government to run this country- has been handed an amendment to the Appropriation Bill that would be the absolute pinnacle of obstruction. This House is getting the name of being a House of obstruction. Two or three of the honourable senators on the opposite side have bragged quite openly that 22 Bills have been rejected and that therefore the Government has the grounds to call for a double dissolution. There is nothing to be proud about in the rejection of those Bills. One Bill that comes to my mind is the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. This Bill, by the way, was to facilitate the amalgamation of trade unions. The trade union movement was in agreement with amalgamation; the Employers' Federation was in agreement with amalgamation; and indeed a number of the Opposition senators agreed to amalgamation in principle. The Opposition had the numbers and the power to take this Bill into Committee and amend it in any way it saw fit. But it decided to obstruct and not even take the Bill any further. It just disregarded the Bill. It even rejected a move by the Government to impose a levy to pay for Medibank. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The position today is that the Opposition has decided that, if it were to get to the Government benches, it would introduce a levy to pay for Medibank. The Opposition hides behind the letter of the law. It claims that its actions are lawful and proper. I am not qualified to go into the finer points of law and, indeed, I do not intend to do so. That is not the way the people of Australia will judge our actions. However, I do know that should anyone care to enforce a number of laws and Acts in Australia, particularly in the Australian Capital Territory, he would be held up to ridicule by the nation. For example, we have the Gambling Act of 1739, the Witchcraft Act of 1735 and the Murder Act of 175 1. This last Act provides the death penalty for anyone who saves a murderer. Anyone found with his face blackened or wearing felt or other slippers or otherwise disguised can be prosecuted in the Australian Capital Territory. </para>

            <para>- Yes. A lot of people go around in disguise. In the United Kingdom the death penalty is provided for stealing sheep. The United Kingdom has a law to prevent anyone leaving the district on a Sunday. Surely it would be the height of irresponsibility for one to enforce these laws. One of the reasons that nobody would be so stupid as to try to enforce the letter of such laws- quite apart from insulting the intelligence of the people- is that one would not be prepared to reap the wrath or the indignation of the people. I believe that the Opposition, by its actions of blocking Supply and hiding behind what it claims to be a lawful and proper exercise, is inviting the wrath of the people. It is the height of irresponsibility for the Senate to demand an election of the people's House just because it feels that the popularity poll is in the Opposition's favour. It is of no use the Opposition saying anything else. That is exactly what it feels. </para>

        <para>The Opposition props up a leader at the behest of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony.</inline> It is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> who goads the Opposition on. Whenever the Opposition thinks that its new leader has hit the top of the hit parade it tries for another election. The truth of the matter is that the Opposition thought it could see in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> another Petrov. It has fallen flat on its face. The trouble is that the Opposition does not have a Bob Menzies to pull the wool over the eyes of the people. The Opposition has ended up catching a tiger by the tail. I think that if I were a member of the Opposition 1 would hang my head in shame. Not only has the Opposition blotted its copy book but also it has written the blackest page in Australia's political history. To say that the Opposition's action is a proper and lawful exercise is bad argument. This has been demonstrated by people in all cities. Today 1 received a letter from the Methodist Church of Australasia. I think it is worth reading. I believe most honourable senators have received this letter. </para>

          <para>At the meeting of the South Australian Methodist Conference of Australasia held on 23 October the following resolution was passed: </para>
          <para>That the following message be sent to the Governor-General and all Federal parliamentarians. </para>
          <para>The South Australia Methodist Conference meeting in Adelaide and comprising men and women of differing political party sympathies, believes that there are times when matters of principle and national well-being must clearly be put above party loyalty. </para>
          <para>As a Conference we could not give, nor be expected to give unqualified endorsement to the performance of the Government. There is much which gives cause for disquiet. Some of us would sympathise with the Opposition 's claim regarding the incompetence of the Government, and given opportunity would doubtless be pleased to see a change in Government. </para>
          <para>We believe, that to seek electoral change at this time by using the power of the Senate to effectively block supply is to use that power in a way which threatens the future of stable government in this nation, and bring great hardship upon many people. </para>
          <para>We would therefore earnestly plead with all Senators, and especially those from South Australia not to block supply. A strong and responsible decision on your part not to pursue such a course would not only afford a solution to the impasse which threatens our nation, but could only enhance your standing within the Church, the Parliament, and the Community. </para>
          <para>We assure you, and all the Members of the Parliament, of our genuine concern and interest and of our continuing  goodwill and prayerful support at this time, and at all times, as you seek to fulfil the responsible duties which are yours. ' </para>

            <para>-Mal Fraser, the Leader of the minority Party in the House of Representatives, has, at the behest of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony,</inline> instructed the Liberal-Country Party Opposition to block Supply and to try to force the democratically elected Government to the polls. This is a sheer abuse of the power which the Opposition thinks it can use at a whim. If the Opposition were more attuned to the realities of life and less to its lust for power, it would realise that the use of that power is resented by the people of Australia. Doug Anthony has put Liberal leader after Liberal leader up for political sacrifice to gain his own. ends. I do not think members of the Liberal Party have woken up to that yet. But Anthony is an honourable man and Liberal senators are honourable senators. As long as the Opposition thinks it has the letter of the law to hide behind, the shrewd boy, the smart politician, the one who keeps putting the Liberal leaders' heads on the chopping block still rules supreme. He still survives. </para>

            <para>-I may have the Shakes per ian names mixed up but the characters are right. I sincerely hope that the actions of the Senate will not cause violence in the streets of our cities. I believe it is cold comfort to be able to say that our actions are lawful and proper. Of course, the Opposition senators are honourable senators. I have one word of gratitude for the Opposition. Its irresponsible actions over the last 2 or 3 weeks have welded the Australian Labor Party into one good fighting machine. As a matter of fact, the Opposition has taken from the benches of office an arrogance and resentment of the people who now occupy the Government benches in this chamber. Unfortunately, one or two of our members have been almost apologetic about occupying those benches. But now the Opposition has given them a dignity of office. For that I thank the Opposition. When the Senate uses its executive powers to dictate to a democratically elected government, then we can say that the principles embodied in a free constitution are irrevocably lost. I appeal to the Opposition to study the situation and to pass these Bills. I commend the Bills to the House. </para>

          <para>- A great deal of argument which surrounds the issues before the Senate today, as it has on earlier occasions, refers to matters of principle. I suppose that to those of us who are involved in any form of public life at all there will always be argument as to whether a principle exists. If it does exist there will be argument as to whether a principle is being upheld or "broken. The Opposition, in electing to defer these Bills, is responding to a situation which, in my view, clearly calls for a decision to be made which reflects a principle or principles. A great deal has been said about allowing a government to run its full term. By some this would be regarded as a principle. By others it would be regarded as something being generally understood. By others again, it would be regarded as a convention. An equal amount has been said about the Senate having certain powers, authorities, rights and principles by which it may abide. It has the power, the authority and the right, among other things, to defer an Appropriation Bill and that authority, that right and that power have been acknowledged and spelled out very clearly and for very clear purposes. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The people who wrote the Constitution around the turn of the century put these provisions in for very good reasons and for very clear purposes because they knew, and this needs to be restated all these years later, that the smaller States- that is, those smaller in population would not be in the Federation and would not have voted for Federation unless they had some protection given to them in the Senate. As a result of their representation they received and still have that protection. All members of the Senate are well aware of the words in the Constitution. It says: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Further on it says: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">These provisions within the Constitution plainly establish, and it needs to be repeated again and again that while the Senate of itself may not amend what we understand as money Bills it can pass them, reject them or defer them and it has this right because it is equal in powers with the House of Representatives in respect of such measures. So while the Senate may not amend certain measures it may reject them in the ordinary course of debate or may adjourn or even defer them. </para>
        <para>It needs to be said again also that the people who put the Constitution together in those early years did not confer these powers, these authorities and rights upon the Senate for nothing. They did not put them in with some sort of feeling that they might never be exercised, required or used. They put them in so that all people within Australia in their various representations would have the right to prevent the onward course of certain patterns of legislation or patterns of life which the nation regarded as being destructive and not in the best interests of the country. </para>
        <para>So if the Senate has that power, that right and that authority it follows that it always has to consider these things together with its duty in all matters, because when the Senate takes its duty into account it has to wrestle with some other matters which might be described as principles. It becomes a question of whether the Party in control of the Senate should exercise that control taking into account the effects which any of its actions can have. It is a question of whether the Party in control does nothing in a given situation or takes its rights, powers and duties into account and does something about that situation. It is something yet to be defined whether when a group, such as a government, does things of very great harm, it is to be allowed to continue and the people in the Senate should sit down, do nothing and let that harm continue. So the first thing to say in this great debate is that not to reject Supply would be to take the easy way out of this situation. </para>
        <para>We could very well say: 'Let the Government continue until its allotted term of office expires. Let it continue for its full term but also let inflation soar; let the level of unemployment rise to 400 000 or 500 000 people; let the shopkeepers go out of business; let the small businesses, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> admitted in this place the other day in reply to a question of mine, continue to go out of business; let the Parliament continue to be misled, and this has not been denied; let the list of unanswered questions continue; let the Ministers continue to be dismissed for misleading the Parliament. Let all these things continue'. Surely no responsible group within the Senate can possibly allow these and other circumstances to continue. The matter of letting these conditions continue becomes especially significant when we are in a position to stop it, to do something about it and to follow in the tradition of all British Parliaments and refer these matters to the ultimate authority in this country, the people of Australia. </para>
        <para>If there are any sections of the community which say that we ought to let the Budget pass, I wonder whether they may be offering this kind of encouragement for people to do what they believe to be the right thing for the wrong reason. So we are in a very serious position. We have a power, an authority and a right. We also have a duty and in considering that duty there are many things to be taken into account. There is, as everybody knows, the fine point of deferral as opposed to rejection and I repeat that if rejection were to be persisted with, what guarantee has the Parliament that an election would follow? The Government could very well withhold the holding of an election. It would have its Budget rejected and could leave it rejected until after an election. In short, the Prime Minister would then stand as someone ready and prepared to cause hardship and confusion to hurt people and to cause shortages until he gave an election assurance- and as I am speaking he has not given any assurance- that there would be an election. While we defer the measures, and I use the word 'defer' with some emphasis, the fact remains that it is within our power to resurrect those measures the moment the Government indicates that it is prepared in the true tradition of the British parliamentary system, in the conventions of the British parliamentary system and in the conventions of the Australian parliamentary system, to go to the people. </para>
        <para>Talking about the conventions of the Westminster system, the Prime Minister of the day is under a very serious charge because when the Government has gone through a process of Ministers resigning, a process of hurt and hardship to people, a process of charges of misleading the Parliament, it is surely the duty of the Prime Minister of the day to say: 'If you make these charges let the people who put us here decide. Let us go to the people, let us bring on an election and let the judges of the parliamentary system in this country make a determination'. Indeed, the honourable gentleman who holds the office of Prime Minister now is very much on record as subscribing to this point of view. On 25 August 1970, 5 years ago, his words and his intention were quite clear and I shall quote them, as others have quoted them and as others I have no doubt will quote them again. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Let us take this Budget and the Government which produced it to the people themselves. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">He was talking about the then Liberal-Country Party Government. He continued: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Parliament has already voted Supply to the end of November. By that time there can be an election for both Houses. An election therefore would cause no disruption. The only thing that will cause disruption is the continuance of this Government. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Let me remind the Senate again of the other remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> the then Leader of the Opposition and the man who now is proclaiming in the Parliament the necessity for continuing what he is pleased to call conventions, procedures and traditions.

        </quote>
        <para class="block">Why is he reacting so violently to a similar suggestion now? How can he escape the consequences of his own words when, on 1 October 1970, he said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>We all know that in British parliaments the tradition is that if a Money Bill is defeated ... the government goes to the people to seek their endorsement of its policies. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Is the Prime Minister prepared to go to the people again? Is the Prime Minister prepared to go out to Government House with the same speed as he went a little earlier? Not at all. The Prime Minister is well aware of the political mood of this country. He is not prepared to seek an election because he knows perfectly well what the result will be. These are the words of the present Prime Minister. These are the words of the Government. These are the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt.</inline> These are the words of the Senators McClelland- both James and Douglas. These are the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee, Senator Cavanagh</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline> Yes, they are their words. They have not repudiated them. They have not disowned them. They have not laid them to one side. They have not denied the sentiments of their Leader. By their silence they have agreed to them. Therefore we believe that we have reached the time to take the Government to the people so that the people can decide. </para>
        <para>The people should decide whether they want this Government to continue to govern. That is fair enough. Do the Australian people want continuing government interference in their lives? Do the Australian people want an Australian community that is becoming increasingly and totally dependent upon government services? Do the Australian people want an Australian community that is able to express itself or has its expressions made for it? Those are decisions that the people must make and the Government of the day- the Prime Minister in particular should be courageous and confident enough to take the issues to the people. The Prime Minister should go to the people and ask them whether they want to have a choice of vocation, whether they want to have a choice of education, whether they want to have a choice of health services, whether they want to have a choice of the type of house and place in which they live and whether they want to be able to own their own homes. </para>
        <para>Talking about the owning of homes, why is it that the latest edition of the National Bank of Australia's review has come out with the following heading on its cover: 'Home ownership- A dilemma or a discretion'? The article under that heading heavily underlines the fact that home construction has decreased sharply during the past year and says that Australians face the dilemma of prohibitive repayments in relation to their housing and their home ownership, if they can secure the finance, or alternatively of resigning themselves to foregoing home ownership. The Australian dream of owning a home has been shattered. We can talk a great deal about housing and homes. I have interposed that reference because home ownership, housing and accommodation are the very basis of the Australian style of life and the Australian quality of life. It is those people who should be given a chance of expressing their view in relation to the incompetence of the present Government. </para>
        <para>What about the opportunities available to the low income earner who has been rapidly forced into a state of poverty? What about the worker who has no assets? What about the young people who are anxious to get somewhere? Does the Government not think that they ought to have a chance to express their views on the manner in which they have been treated? All of those people and others have been hurt by the Government. That, coupled with the fact that the Government has continually misled and is continuing to mislead the people, is surely according to convention, principle or duty- call it what you like- a case for making the Prime Minister go to the people and let them decide. </para>
        <para>As if that were not enough we have the latest addition to all of this which has come about in connection with the admission by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)-</inline> indeed, it has been more than an admission- relating to the supplying of the Budget Papers to the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I have seen this matter reported. It has not been denied that there has been a sort of deliberate leak because the Treasurer has been afraid that he will be found out. Why has this preferential treatment been given in the releasing of the Budget Papers in this age of what the present Government has been pleased to describe as participatory democracy? Why has one particular person or section been allowed to receive the Budget Papers 6 hours before the rest of the community? Who is the leader of the ACTU in a society in which there is great emphasis on what I will call enforced equality that he is to receive preferment? How does the Government justify the releasing of these papers to the head of the ACTU, to the  President  of the Australian Labor Party, to an entrepreneur and businessman of some ability and distinction who has not only Australia-wide but also world-wide connections when it is not done under the security arrangements under which other people are placed? Why should he have total access to the Budget Papers some hours before they are released to the Parliament and to the general public? Why can the Employers Federation not have this kind of treatment? Why can the Chamber of Manufactures not have it? </para>
        <para>If the Government does not like that sort of reference, what is wrong with the Australian Council of Social Services having <inline font-style="italic">entre</inline> to it? After all the pensioner leagues and the social services organisations represent an enormous number of people within the Australian community. They have the greatest amount possible to gain or lose by any Budget. Indeed, their opinions are sought by the media almost instantaneously with the release of the Budget. Why, in a society which claims to have open government, are the Budget Papers not released to a wider section of the community so that others can have equality with the leader of the trade union movement and so that others can have equal opportunity, which is something that I seem to have heard repeated on many occasions on the Government side of the chamber. In my view the Treasurer has deliberately misled the Australian people and this constitutes an affront to the Parliament. That is just another reason why the Prime Minister should provide the people of Australia with the opportunity of going to an election. </para>
        <para>I wonder whether honourable senators have seen the reference in a Sydney newspaper the other day which concerned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> 's mandate to govern and which was written in the following words: </para>
        <quote>

I do not desire to embark upon repetition, but I would like to say that there is a question to which I have referred previously and to which I again refer which is the main component of this whole discussion. The one question before the House in relation to these Bills is whether Supply will be granted on the authenticity of the Bills themselves. In the whole discussion which took place on the 2 discussions previously and which has taken place so far today very little, if any, reference has been made to the Appropriation Bills and the need to grant Supply. We have had red herrings drawn across the trail in connection with the doings or misdoings of the Government, which is a state of affairs that one would expect to see in the party political arena. Unfortunately we are losing the substance for the shadow. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The question of whether the Senate grants Supply is a matter which should be considered entirely on the merits of the Budget. It is to the credit of members of the Senate, more particularly to those of the Opposition, that the Estimates were gone through with a fine-tooth comb. Questions were asked on them and those questions were answered. It was very evident to me, as a member of one of those Senate committees, that it was necessary to ask those questions. It was also evident to me that the replies received were most satisfactory. When all is said and done, the government of the day recommends policy, the Parliament of the day endorses or rejects that policy, the Minister issues instruction in accordance with the parliamentary decision, and departmental heads implement the scheme. They act irrespective of the government which is in power. So the only thing that matters in connection with policy is what the Parliament has accepted, because funds are required only for that legislation which is accepted by the Parliament. When we realise that the departmental heads have done great credit to themselves in answering all the questions which were asked and that this questioning was extended over a period which was 5, 6 or 7 times greater than in any period previously, it goes to show how very definite members of the Senate were that they should have the truth in connection with the Appropriation Bills. We have it. </para>
        <para>The main issue is clouded by things outside the actual Bills which are before the Parliament. My support for the granting of Supply is given because I maintain that the Appropriation Bills, as part of the Budget, are responsible and have borne out the requirements of a very close examination. If we are prepared to refuse the granting of Supply we are creating a breakdown in parliamentary democracy. We are creating a state of affairs which strikes at the very heart of the Constitution, about which we have heard so much, and which strikes at the very heart of the people who have elected folk to Parliament. I was somewhat intrigued when I examined closely the amendment which the Opposition presented previously. 1 have no doubt that, in accordance with the Constitution, the Senate can block Supply. Let me read out some of the phrases contained in the Opposition 's previous amendment. It stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>That the powers of the Senate were expressly conferred on the Senate as part of the Federal Compact which created the Commonwealth of Australia. </para>
          <para>That the legislative power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Parliament of the Commonwealth which consists of the Queen, the Senate and House of Representatives. </para>
          <para>That the Senate has the right and duty to exercise its legislative power and to concur or not to concur, as the Senate sees fit, bearing in mind the seriousness and responsibility of its actions, in all proposed laws passed by the House of Representatives. </para>
          <para>That there is no convention and never has been any convention that the Senate shall not exercise its constitutional powers. </para>
          <para>That the Senate affirms that it has the constitutional right to act as it did and now that there is a disagreement between the Houses of the Parliament and a position may arise where the normal operations of government cannot continue, a remedy is presently available to the Government under section 57 of the Constitution to resolve the deadlock. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Let me refer particularly to one of those paragraphs. I refer to the words 'bearing in mind the seriousness and responsibility of its actions, in all proposed laws passed by the House of Representatives'. I point out to the Senate that the numbers in the House of Representatives are only slightly in favour of the Government, and the numbers in the Senate are very, very slightly in favour of the Opposition. In view of the closeness of these numbers, and more particularly in view of the fact that a deceased senator's place is not now occupied- that deceased senator was on the side of the Government- I think it would be only right and reasonable to assume that in this situation the. Opposition would not have played the game as it is playing it. The numbers are so close. If there were big majorities either way I would take an entirely different view of that aspect. I do not base my argument on convention. It has no substance in law. Convention represents an implied arrangement at a specific time and is, and should be, subject to change. There is no doubt in the world about that. The changes in convention of which we have heard so much have been brought about by the new conditions which prevail today, however there cannot be any breakdown in basic fundamentals. </para>
        <para>What is the basic fundamental in connection with this issue? Surely the basic fundamental is that the Government must . be permitted to govern and must be supplied with necessary funds. Why should this be so? It is because the Constitution requires a government to be elected every 3 years and because the expressed will of the electors should be observed in a democratic society. The Constitution does not give the Senate the right to demand an election each year. It gives the Senate the right to reject Supply. It gives the Senate the right to reject Bills, but it does not give the Senate the right to force an election at its behest. It is only a matter of party politics that brings that state of affairs into being. As an independent senator I shall raise my voice very loudly in an endeavour to get people to judge these matters on their merits and in accordance with the democratic system. </para>
        <para>By refusing Supply the Opposition is abusing a privilege bequeathed by the Constitution. What does the Opposition say? It says, in reality: There is nothing wrong with these Appropriation Bills. We are prepared to pass them' but only in accordance with the amendment, namely, that the Bills be not further proceeded with until the Government agrees to submit itself to the judgment of the people '. About 1 7 months ago this Government submitted itself to the judgment of the people as a result of pressure such as that which is now being exerted. The result was that the people confirmed the Government's actions. It has been proved repeatedly that there is no substitute for the democratic system. That system had its birth in the Parliament of the land, and it must be preserved by the Parliament. </para>
        <para>During this debate we have heard many eminent jurists discussed and their opinions given. I take the privilege of introducing into this discussion a new jurist in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> E. McGarvie, Q.C., who wrote a letter which was published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> yesterday. I agree entirely with the letter. It is headed 'The great risk is totalitarianism'. I quote from the letter: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I fear that the Opposition's blocking of Supply in the Senate, if it succeeds in its objective, could bring about changes in political attitudes and assumptions quite capable of leading to totalitarian government within a decade. </para>
          <para>I believe parliamentary democracy to be the only acceptable form of government for Australia. Despite the rapid changes of our times it can effectively eliminate injustice and make the necessary reforms. But many who have been troubled by social injustices in the community have questioned the ability of democracy to remedy them. They believed that if a reforming Government actually took determined steps in the interests of the under-privileged, the conservative establishment would soon displace it by changing the ground rules. If the denial of Supply were allowed to lead to the displacement of the Government the number of doubters of democracy would increase alarmingly. </para>
          <para>To make the parliamentary system workable all parties, from Federation to 1974, acted so that the party with the House of Representatives majority continued in government for its term. Reliance on the constitutional power to reject Supply misses the point. The continuation of democracy requires political parties to do more than exact their constitutional pound of flesh. It requires restraint so as to comply with the basic assumptions and practices that make democracy workable. It is well to remember that most of what was done by Hitler was done within constitutional power. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That means simply that loyalty, understanding and a love of people is necessary, as opposed to tyranny and oppression under other systems of government. That is the difference between the 2 systems of democracy and totalitarianism. Australia has been very successful in working under the democratic form of government throughout the years, with the 2 political parties in the main respecting each other and accepting the will of the people at the ballot box. Indeed, that is the state of affairs which should apply for all time. It would appear that in the main everything that the Party in government does is condemned by the Opposition, irrespective of which Party is in opposition. I mentioned the other night that in excess of 100 Bills have been passed by the Parliament this year. Some of those Bills have contained some socialistic flavour. Those Bills were passed, and passed unanimously, by the Opposition. Now the Opposition is refusing Supply, and this means that the normal general functioning of Parliament cannot proceed, that things have to come to a standstill, and indeed that legislation which this Parliament passed not only the Government but this Parliamentcannot be carried into effect. I am one of the few members of the Senate who have opposed two or three motions- I have opposed them more or less on my own but with the assistance of one or two members of the Opposition- because I am opposed wholeheartedly to the setting up of commissions, authorities and so on which seek to bring new forms of parliamentary procedure into effect. Such legislation can be, and has been in the past, carried out by officers of the various departments. </para>
        <para>To me the position is very clear. If we are to have responsible government we need to have responsible people on both sides of the Parliament- people who are prepared to accept the will of the people. How often we hear people express their opinions. My mail box has been completely full every day for the last 3 weeks. I have received letters from a cross-section of the Australian community. Strange to relate, most of the letters have come from States other than New South Wales. There has been only the odd letter which has not complimented me on the stand that I have taken in connection with the Appropriation Bills. People of all sorts of political persuasions- ex-members of the Liberal Party, ex-members of the Country Party, and of course members of the Labor Party, but also many people of independent thought- have in the first instance complimented me on my independence in relation to this matter. They said that they were proud to be members of my Party because I was prepared to look at this matter in its true light. </para>
        <para>I take notice of these letters because it is the inherent right of the people to express themselves and it is the inherent right of people to expect government for the people by the people. For the Opposition to seek a change of government at this time by using the power of the Senate to block Supply is to use that power in a way which threatens the future of stable government and brings great hardship on many people. Let me again say that people expect government for the people by the people. They do not expect to be pushed around by the Party political machine. They desire fair play in parliamentary matters, the same as in other matters. So we find that there is a disquiet amongst the people. </para>
        <para>Much has been said about the ineptitude of the Government. All the blame for the depressions, inflation and unemployment has been thrust upon the Government. Through the years depressions have come and gone, inflation has come and gone, and the employment figures rise and fall. I do not give the Government all the credit or the blame for the pluses or for the minuses. Many factors bring about depressions, and many factors can cure them. Governments only have a part to play. I was rather interested to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> make reference to the changes in the opinions expressed by many people who have been privileged to speak in parliamentary debates. I admit that what he said is very true, but I go so far as to say that that is the legacy of Party politics. Unfortunately Party politicians speak according to the whim and feeling of the Party at the particular moment. They ask: 'What is going to suit my Party best?' Neither of the major political parties is immune from that statement. Indeed, if we could look at things from an independent point of view or from a general point of view, in accordance with our democratic system of government, we would find a much better state of affairs developing. </para>
        <para>I do not desire to detain the Senate any longer. Suffice to say that there is nothing abnormal about the Appropriation Bills which are before the Parliament. There is nothing abnormal about the priorities which have been extended in those Appropriation Bills. There is nothing abnormal in finding funds to finance the philosophies which have been advanced. We are living in a world of change. We are living at a time when there is plenty for all, and we should have a government to see that that plenty for all is made available to all. I have been accused of being a socialist. Let me tell those who have made that accusation that I am a super-democrat. I am one of those who values greatly indeed the blessings which have been bestowed upon me, upon other honourable gentlemen and upon the Australian community by the system of" democracy. That system of democracy is now at stake. It is unwise to allow that situation to continue. The Opposition has drawn a red herring across the trail by looking for all types of advantages from refusing Supply, instead of looking at the Appropriation Bills according to their merit. The refusal of Supply is entirely unjustified, and this country will be done an immense amount of harm if the Opposition succeeds in its mission. </para>

One thing that I wish to make quite clear at the outset is that I have received some letters of criticism for my stand in this affair. The criticism has been that I am subservient to my Party. I wish to nail that for what it is- a falsehood. I am an Australian, and proudly so; I am an Aborigine, and fiercely proudly so; but I am a thinking Australian and a thinking Aborigine, and I am appalled at what has happened to my nation under this present Government. There are many things for which I believe this Government has to answer to the electors. It must face the people of this country and receive the support of the majority of the people. </para>

Allow me to raise my voice alongside that of my Leader, Malcolm Fraser, when I state categorically that there is no constitutional crisis. It is quite clear and quite plain in the Constitution that the Senate has the right- it is given to it under that Constitution- to reject any Supply Bill, any money Bill or any Bill whatsoever. So let us have done with that humbug and hypocrisy that we are having a constitutional crisis at the moment; we are not. The crisis that we are having is the crisis concerned with the ineptitude and incompetence of a government that has been sitting on the Government benches for the last 3 years. </para>

        <para class="block">The ACTING  DEPUTY PRESIDENT-  The practice seems to have grown up on both sides of the chamber, to my knowledge, to engage in a good deal of repetition. Points are made for one side and points are made for the other side.

I will continue my speech on this particular subject. I still say that honourable senators on the other side of the chamber should hang their heads in shame when they come up with all this humbug and hypocrisy about voting against the Supply Bills. There are still fifteen of them sitting on the Government benches who were here in 1972 and who voted with the former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> now a Justice of the High Court, when he moved that motion and when he said those words. They were here and they voted with him. So let us have no more of this humbug and mischief that is going on at the moment about a constitutional crisis. There is no constitutional crisis. The only crisis is that, as I said earlier, the Government is not prepared to face the people of this country and let them pass their judgment on the Government's record. Let us look at the record of this Government. We have the worst depression of the last 30 years, with 400 000 people unemployed. This concerns me greatly because I come from the working ranks. I have been a labourer and a working man all my life. Thank God I have never been a member of the Labor Party, but I have been a labourer and worked with my hands all my life. I have a great concern for the 400 000 people who are unemployed because of the mismanagement of this Government. Look at the inflation rate, which is the highest in 40 years. </para>

        <para class="block">McLaren knows that that is true and we all know that it is true.

No one can tell me that the Prime Minister of a country would not have some knowledge of the things that two of his senior ministers were doing. He had knowledge of it, and on that score alone, because of his gross incompetence, he should resign and submit himself to the will of the people. The Government would have us believe that its policies are for the good of this nation. If that is the case, let it go to the people and let the people speak. Let the people decide whether the Government's policies are the best or not. The Government should not continue on its present course until the economy of this country is completely plundered and there is a depression the like of which we have never seen. </para>
        <para>I am quite sure that there are honourable senators here today who, like me, recall those black days of the 1930s. I lived through them. God forbid that any of my children or grandchildren should have to experience a repetition of those times- times of suffering, human misery and deprivation. Goodness me, with the way this Government is carrying on we are heading fast for that situation. They were times when once proud working men were reduced to shambling wrecks through no fault of their own, unable adequately to support their families, stripped of their pride and robbed of their dignity. Is that what we want to see? I think not. I want to see this Government face the people and let the people make the judgment, as we on this side of the chamber are prepared to let them do. We can look at a long list of scandals involving this Government: The Murphy-ASIO raids; the unethical attempt to manipulate Parliament by the Gair affair; the shocking impropriety of the sacking of the <inline font-weight="bold">Speaker, Mr Cope;</inline> the Phillip Cairns affair; the Moroni affair; the Hayden Budget leak; the loans affair and so many other matters. </para>

            <para>-That is right; that is a good idea. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> I do not have a great deal more to say because I think the record speaks for itself without my going any further. Much has been said on this side of the chamber. Arguments have been put very strongly, very firmly and very wisely by other members of the Opposition. All I say in conclusion is that there is no constitutional crisis. I cannot stress that enough, and I want the people of Australia to know that we are not facing a constitutional crisis. The only crisis that we are likely to face will be caused because this Government is not prepared to go to the people. The Appropriation Bills will lie on the table and not be passed by this chamber until the Government is prepared to go to the people. If there is any suffering amongst the people of Australia, then the Government is responsible for that. It is the Government's responsibility because it is the Government. If it is prepared to submit itself to the people then we will certainly give very speedy passage to the Appropriation Bills. There will be no trouble at all. People will be paid and the money will flow. But it is up to the Government. Let the Government have the courage of its convictions and go with us to its masters, the people of Australia. </para>

          <para>- In order that this country can be administered efficiently and properly and in accordance with convention and standard practice, the Government is attempting today to have restored to the Senate notice paper Appropriation Bills that the Opposition continues, in defiance of the welfare of the Australian people, to have deferred. Despite what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> has said, there is a crisis in Australia. Whether it be a constitutional crisis or a political crisis is little to the point. The fact is that there is a crisis and the crisis was not brought about by rejection of the Budget, as the Opposition has attempted to imply. The crisis is brought about by the attitude of the Opposition in continuing to defer consideration of the Budget. It has not rejected the Budget. Indeed, it would get some respect from the Australian people if it had the courage of its convictions and moved for the rejection of the Budget. But the Opposition has not done that. That is the gravamen of the issue. What it has done is to move an amendment to seek deferral of the Budget. It has failed to move for any outright rejection. If it moves for outright rejection, that is its right. It is the Opposition's entitlement to do that, but it has not done so, nor will it do so, I suggest, while there are so many in its ranks who are opposed to the principle of rejection by the Senate of money Bills. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Having said those things, I must say that I am amazed at the attitude of members of the Opposition. They are irresponsible and obviously they are indifferent to the welfare of the people. They are arrogant in their display of the power of numbers in the Senate in what is I suggest, and as my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland the Minister for Labor and Immigration suggested this morning, an unrepresentative House whilst they conveniently ignore the weight of numbers given to the Government in the House of Representatives by the people of Australia through the ballot box only 18 months ago. Members of the Opposition have had 2 elections in 3 years. Now they want 3 elections in 3 years. Merely to satisfy their wants, their lust for power, they adopt this callous, ill-conceived and terribly tragic attitude of deferral. It is an attitude which is tragic for Australia and Australians. We know that in December 1972- not 3 years ago- they lost the power of government which they had possessed previously for 23 years. Like someone addicted to drugs, members of the Opposition find it difficult to kick the habit of power. They must have it back. They demanded an election in May 1974 because they were addicted to power. They had the election. They lost the election and shortly after that in their hallucinatory state or period of remorse they sacked their then leader. They have now acquired a new leader, the honourable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> Now again, in their craving for power, in their addiction to a Cassius Clay philosophy of greater than thou, they have turned aside the long, well established, well understood, accepted and acclaimed standards of democracy and convention. </para>
        <para>Let us look at the Senate numbers as a result of the 1 974- last year's- Federal election. Last year there was a double dissolution of the Parliament. Last year the Labor Government was re-elected to office, lt was given a mandate by the people in the House of Representatives. At the same time as the House of Representatives election there was also a Senate election. At that Senate election 29 Government senators, 29 Liberal Party senators, one Liberal Movement senator and one independent senator were elected. The Opposition was not given a majority in this House by the people. It was given the same numbers as the Government was given by the people in this Senate. At that dme, at that election the Opposition was not given a mandate to govern in the House of Representatives. So too it was not given a mandate by the people to frustrate or defer in the Senate. The simple fact of the matter is whether we like it or not- quite frankly, I do not like saying it- if the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> were alive today, and he passed away a mere 3 months ago, the Opposition would not be able to conduct itself as it is conducting itself today in challenging the convention of elective parliamentary democracy by moving its amendment for deferral of the Budget. As members of the Opposition polarised and divided this great nation and the Australian people in respect of Vietnam when they were in office, so too are they now polarising the people and the Australian nation by their tearing up of the long established principles of democracy and the conventions which bring about stability and confidence within a nation. Those conventions which we all understand and know about in the Senate deliberately set out to provide for periods of stability of government on a democratically elected basis. </para>
        <para>In making provision for that basis of democracy, those conventions also provide for the protection of the rights of the Opposition and for the protection of the rights of minority sections in the community. If there is an election, the mass of the people speaks. That mass of the people speaks through the ballot box and elects a government. At the same time, the minority of the people is provided with a voice. As the people elect a government, so too at the same time they elect an Opposition. That is what happened a mere 1 7 months ago. The people elected a government and they elected an Opposition. By the Constitution the Opposition in the House of Representatives and in this place are provided with rights. The Opposition in the Senate is entitled to take certain courses of action in regard to financial decisions of the Government. Firstly, if it likes, it can accept a Budget. The Opposition has not done that, at least so far this year. Secondly, if it likes, it can seek an amendment of a money Bill presented by the House of Representatives. It can carry a request for an amendment to be referred to the House of Representatives for consideration. The Opposition has refused and still refuses to pursue that course. </para>
        <para>Thirdly, if it so chooses, it has the right, I suggest, to reject a money Bill. But as I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, the Opposition has not taken that course because it knows that on that issue its ranks would crack open like dried timber. What members of the Opposition have done and what they are doing now is to say to the Parliament and to the Australian people that they refuse to consider the Budget unless it is on a condition imposed upon the Government by them. Indeed, they say in their thinking and statements that if that condition is agreed they will pass the Appropriation Bills. Therefore, one must assume that to them there cannot be much wrong with the Budget. In plain words, as I have said, only the death of one of our colleagues on this side of the Senate has put the Opposition in the position in which it can now accept legislation conditionally. It is like holding a gun at a man's head. No government can tolerate such a situation. I am certain that Australians as great people will not allow it to happen. </para>
        <para>As was mentioned here this morning, it has been claimed in the publication the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletincertainly</inline> not a publication which gives support to the Government- that there has been a groundswell against the Opposition in the last week in the public ranks. Whilst the Opposition continues to adopt the attitude it has adopted it will continue to lose the support of the Australian people. It is Opposition members who have ripped up the conventions in the last 12 months. It is they who are depriving the people of democracy in this country. It is they who are depriving the people of the financial sinews that are necessary to keep the Australian economy going. It is they who are showing a callous indifference to the welfare of the Australian people. I urge them- I implore them- to rethink their megalomaniac attitude. </para>

          <para>- This is the third time that this message has been debated in this Senate. It has amazed me on every occasion when we hear our opposition the Government- standing up and talking about such things as principles and conventions when all the time they are basically talking on double standards. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, who has just finished speaking, has been highly critical of the actions of the Opposition. Yet I can recall an occasion in this place in 1 970-1 have a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> before me- when in a division on the third reading of an Appropriation Bill the Labor Party voted against us as the Government, and included in the names of those who voted against us was none other than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland. He on that occasion saw fit to vote against Supply but on this occasion, in government, he sees fit to turn around and condemn us in opposition for adopting exactly the same role. So when we start talking about credibility and double standards we should look also at the record of this Government in the last few months. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The reason the Opposition has adopted its present stance is the culmination of many factors factors that have been dealt with by so many people; factors that made it necessary for us, after a lot of deep and serious consideration to adopt finally the stance we did. If we had not done so we would have been dodging our responsibilities and obligations. It is easy for this Government to stand up today and adopt scare tactics. That is exactly what it is doing. In fact, it has gone so far with its scare tactics, as I said the other day, that it probably has some people convinced that even the River Murray will dry up before this issue is finished. But there is no need to have a crisis in this country. It is not a constitutional crisis; it is a crisis that has been brought about because this Government will not face up to its responsibilities. </para>
        <para>I recall that in 1974, when on a similar occasion we in opposition told the Government clearly that we would defer the Appropriation Bills until such time as the Government was prepared to go to the people, this Government saw fit to go to the people. I question now: Why the sudden change? Why this stance that has been adopted by the Government? Why these scare tactics that are being used by the Government? It is easy to see the reasons why. In 1974 the Government was reasonably confident that with the economic crisis that was going to develop it was better for it in many ways to have an election at that stage than for it to have to sit through the economic crisis and uncertainty of the future months. So it went to the people on that occasion, but it is not prepared to do so now. It comes down to cold hard politics on the Government's part. It is not prepared to go to the people because it realises that it would be beaten if it did so. </para>

            <para>-I quote the results of the latest gallup poll, which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> of 1 November. It showed that the results of the poll of 18 October were that the LiberalNational Country Parties were holding some 50 per cent and the Government Party was holding some 43 per cent. They are the cold hard facts at the present time. I repeat, this Government is using double standards; it is breaking conventions and everything else. No government, no party, has adopted more double standards than this Government in its present actions. We have heard many quotations of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and also ex-Senator Murphy, now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy. I shall mention those again in a minute because I think they should be spelt out as much as we possibly can to let the people of this country see the double standards of this Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Let us look to the other areas of this Government's activities. Consider the loans affair. What is the Government's record of credibility? I say that the credibility of this Government is absolutely bankrupt. In the loans affair we can go back to the Executive Council meeting of 13 December which clearly showed that this Government was prepared to break all conventions and to bypass completely the Constitution. It did this by coming up with the devious and unconstitutional act of saying that it was going to borrow short-term loans from overseas. They were to be short-term loans of some $4000m- I repeat, $4000m- for what the Government described as temporary purposes. They were to be loans that were to be extended over a 20-year period. This has been spelt out by the ex-Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> and it is on record. It has been spelt out also by the Prime Minister and by the Executive Council minutes. </para>
        <para>I ask the Government: If it considers that that is a temporary purpose, what if one of them were suddenly picked up and put away in solitary confinement for 20 years? Would he regard that as being temporary? I doubt very much that he would. The same applies with this whole gory scandal of the loans affair. It has seen the enforced resignation of not only a Treasurer but also a  Deputy  Prime Minister. Lately an Acting Prime Minister, the Minister for Minerals and Energy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> also was forced to resign. Both of these senior men, men who in their periods of time have led Australia in the absence of the Prime Minister, have been forced to resign because they misled the Prime Minister, they misled the Cabinet, they misled the Parliament and they misled this country. Those are not my words, they are the words of the Prime Minister. </para>
        <para>We do not stop there. We go on and come to an issue that was debated in this place yesterday. I refer to the ACTU-Solo exercise- an issue that is not to be allowed to be pushed under the rug; an issue that, is full of grave problems; an issue that leaves much to be answered. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> spelt this out very clearly in the Senate yesterday. There are question marks around this issue. Then of course we find that this week the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> has given information, prior to the Budget being presented to the Parliament, to the  President  of the Australian Labor Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke.</inline> I admit that some of the honourable senators opposite in the Labor Party have admitted that it was wrong for this to be done. Nevertheless, it happened, and I would go so far as to say that if this had happened 3 years ago no doubt we would have seen the resignation of the Treasurer. But it is becoming customary these days to see so many of these things happening in the Government that people tend to take them as a matter of course. </para>
        <para>We know that in England for lesser reasons 2 Treasurers- Chancellors of the Exchequer- were forced to resign for giving information about the Budget. One; in fact, passed some comment to a pressman, as I understand it, on his way into the Parliament to present the Budget. He was forced to resign. This is not happening now, and it comes back to the credibility of this Government when things like this can happen and the Minister still stays. When we compare this with some of the other things that have happened during the term of this Government we see that this is only one of so many similar occurrences. Conventions have been spoken about considerably in this debate, not only today but on other occasions. We talk also about double standards. Let us look at the contradictions between statements made by the Prime Minister when he was Leader of the Opposition and the statements he is making today and also the actions he is taking today. I refer to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 25 August 1970, where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> is reported as saying: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Let us take this Budget, and the Government which produced it, to the people themselves. The Parliament has already voted Supply to the end of November. By that time, there can be an election for both Houses. An election therefore would cause no disruption. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I repeat: 'An election therefore would cause no disruption '. This statement clearly shows that the then Leader of the Opposition expected the Government to pick up its responsibilities if it were defeated and go to the people. That is entirely different from the attitude of the Prime Minister today. I continue the quotation: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The only thing that will cause disruption is the continuance of the Government. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In the same speech on the same day the Prime Minister went on to say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Let me make it clear at the outset that our opposition to this Budget is not mere formality. We intend to press our opposition by all available means on all related measures in both Houses. If the motion is defeated, we will vote against the Bills here and in the Senate. Our purpose is to destroy the Government which has sponsored it. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Those words were spoken by the present Prime Minister when he was Leader of the Opposition. Yet he stands up today and accuses the Opposition of double standards and of breaking conventions. I. ask: Who has the double standards? It is all very well to adopt a role in Opposition. It is all very well to adopt a role when one is Prime Minister of this country which is what the Prime Minister did in 1 974. But he is adopting another role today and using scare tactics in the process. I cite another quotation which was given in October 1970. He stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>We all know that in British Parliaments the tradition is that if a Money Bill is defeated ... the Government goes to the people to seek their endorsement of its policies. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Those statements are on record. They were made by the Prime Minister when he was Leader of the Opposition. </para>
        <para>Today we have heard Ministers in this place stand up and say that we do not have the powers under the Constitution to take the stance which we are taking. But let us look at what the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lionel</inline> Murphy, had to say.  His  credibility is not questioned by this Government because it saw fit to elevate the then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> to the High Court where he is now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy. Let us have none of this poppycock about our actions being unconstitutional. The Labor Party leader of that time, its appointee to the High Court, gave a ruling on the Constitution and the Senate 's powers. He said that the Senate had these powers. As I understand it this was in 1970. He stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>In doing this the Opposition is pursuing a tradition which is well established. But in view of some doubt recently cast on it in this chamber perhaps I should restate the position. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I am quoting the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lionel</inline> Murphy, now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy. He stated: </para>

        <para class="block">I repeat: 'To any financial measure'-  including a tax Bill. There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its constitutional powers, except the limitations imposed by discretion and reason. The Australian Labor Party has acted consistently in accordance with the tradition that we will oppose in the Senate any tax or money Bill or other financial measure whenever necessary to carry out our principles and policies. The Opposition - has done this over the years and in order to illustrate the tradition which has been established, with the concurrence of honourable senators I shall incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> at the end of my speech a list of the measures of an economic or financial nature, including taxation and appropriation Bills, which have been opposed by the Opposition in whole or in part by a vote in the Senate since 1 950. </para>
        <para class="block">That quotation is taken from a speech by former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> the Leader of the Australian Labor Party when in Opposition.

Let us have no more of these double standards. </para>

            <para>- We have explained the reason for deferment. There is a difference. We have control of the Bills while they are in this place. The moment the Labor Party is prepared to go to the people, in an instant we can have Supply running. If these Bills go back to the other place the Government gets control, and with the spiteful ness of the Prime Minister at the present time, anything could happen. We will not abrogate our responsibility. We will keep control of the Bills in this place so that we can make sure that when the Government accepts its responsibility Supply will start immediately. The Government knows this only too well. I have dealt with the Government's record with regard to double standards. Other honourable senators have spoken about the economy generally and the rundown which has taken place. It is a tragic and unnecessary situation. Today this country faces an economic crisis or a depression. Many have said that it is the worst for some 30 years. Unemployment is heading to a figure in excess of 400 000. That is not my estimation. People in the Labor Party have said that. Others have put the figure higher. So one does not have to go into these other areas to point out the lack of credibility of this Government when it comes to economic management or its lack of economic management. </para>

        <para>This Government has spent so much time and so much of its energy and resources in trying to push its ideologies rather than getting on with the economic management of this country that we are facing one of the results today in the unfortunate economic situation which we have in Australia. It is a situation which is singularly peculiar to Australia at the present time. Other countries did have inflation. Other countries had worse inflation than we had. Other countries were more affected by the energy crisis than Australia. But those countries which had been adversely affected by inflation are today recovering rapidly. We have had a slight upturn but if we believe the economic forecasts which have been given to us by many people there is a minimal short term downturn at the present time in the rate of inflation but the forecasts are that we will see an increase in the rate of inflation again. </para>

            <para>- I am . disappointed that there has been. Nobody more than I wants to have a country running properly. It has been a tragedy to see what has happened in this country. Talking about tragedies, let me come back to my own State. Before, I mentioned that this Government was hell bent on pushing its ideologies and its policies rather than engaging in economic management. I refer to a proposed petrochemical industry in South Australia which would have been established at Redcliffs. The industry would have meant a lot of employment. It would have brought other industries. It would have been a very stable industry. In all probability that industry is lost to South Australia today for only one reason and that is the interference of the past Minister for Minerals and Energy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor.</inline> He set out to make sure that his policies would be forced upon our Government Labor Government, incidentally- and the Redcliffs project was deferred. It was deferred again. Today, with the escalation of prices through inflation, we have a situation where there is a big question mark as to whether we will ever have a Redcliffs. Without a Redcliffs or some such industry we are also facing problems with our gas fields in the north of South Australia. This tragic effect has been caused through the stupidity, the arrogance and the interference of the Minister and of this Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I also wish to make some comments about the media. We have seen what the Government has done regarding its mistakes in the economy. We have also seen what it has done when it comes to selling its own policies and developing its great propaganda machine. Some months ago I did an assessment of the cost to the taxpayer of Government propaganda in this country. When the figure came from the Government it showed that up to 3 1 May the Government was spending on Government publicity in excess of $lm a month. That is over $250,000 a week. It was primarily being spent on Government propaganda to sell Government policies and to cover up its mistakes. That was the cost to the taxpayer. One can go on in other areas. Let us look at the television and radio world at the present time. I questioned the Special Minister of State <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland)</inline> who in this chamber represents the Minister for the Media <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Cass)</inline> on 3 September regarding the issue of licences on a temporary basis under the Wireless Telegraphy Act. Here we are at the end of October and still I am awaiting a reply. We know that there is a big doubt about the legality of issuing licences in this way and I question why the Government is still not prepared to state what is the Attorney-General's opinion on this question. I fully support the concept of public broadcasting and ethnic radio but I question the legality of what the Minister is doing. I am still awaiting an answer from him even though my opinion and outside opinion from other lawyers is that what the Government has done is very questionable. </para>
        <para>We then look to other areas to see what is happening. This Government has established a propaganda machine. In the area of public broadcasting, the number of licences being issued at present is of great concern to this country because the media is one area that must be kept free of Government interference. Licences are being issued willy-nilly and on an ad hoc basis at a time of great advances in technology and when there is every need, as the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and others say, for us to have long term planning in the electronics media in Australia because if we do not we will have much trouble. The Government is taking this action to assist its propaganda machine and I take great exception to it. Here again is a waste of taxpayers' funds. It is another example of the double standards of this Government which says one thing and does another. It is another of the black parts which will go into the record books when this Government finally goes to the people. </para>

We leave it to others to answer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> can give the Government all the support it needs. Earlier today an appropriate remark was made about what has happened to this Government with its black record. We have seen what it has done in so many areas. I refer to an earlier statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson.</inline> Looking at the record of this Government we see the Murphy ASIO affair, the Gair affair, the Galston affair, the Moroni affair, the loans affair, the dole cheats, <inline font-style="italic">Blue Poles,</inline> overseas junkets, jobs for the boys, the arts, inflation, unemployment, grants, taxes, prices, strikes, business failures and finally we had the 'Csickness' of the Government- Cope, Cameron, </para>

        <para class="block">Cairns, Connor, Crean. There was also <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard</inline> who was wise enough to get out before this Government went over the cliff. Despite all these things the Prime Minister still says that he has a mandate and that the Opposition has no right to do what it is doing. He has a short memory.

        <para>I conclude by quoting from the editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> of 15 October this year headed Face up to it, Gough'. It states: </para>

        <para class="block">Many other such statements have appeared in the newspapers of Australia. This Government has dug its heels in. It has employed scare tactics in the community. It has done everything but face up to its responsibilities and obligations, and by taking the stance it has it is adopting a double standard. We in the Opposition are not seeking power. We are seeking to give the people of this country the democratic right to pass judgment on the Government or the Opposition.

          <para>- There is only one main issue in this debate and controversy and that is whether the Budget ought to be used as commodity of ransom to force the public to accept an election and the Government to agree to it. Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> is unable to see the simplicity of the argument he has been a far greater help than he knows. He has adopted the standards of the Australian Labor Party for his own and consistently throughout this debate, this continuing saga week by week, the Opposition has justified its action by looking at the Labor Party and saying: 'You did this or recommended that at a certain time'. To begin with we can assume that the Liberal Party is acting on Labor Party standards by its own choice and that, I believe, does not elevate the Liberal Party in this chamber. Nevertheless, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> made some interesting comments. He said that he recalled 1974. I wonder whether he does recall 1974 because time after time Opposition speakers then said: 'We want to test the Government. We want the people to choose'. Surely he can remember that an election was held in that environment. Now 18 months later the same request is made again: 'Let the people choose'. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I wonder whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> or anyone else in his Party would give an undertaking that if the Opposition were to have this election and lost, it would not yet again in 18 months' time call for the same action. Would the Opposition give an undertaking if it got its desire this time that it would not in 18 months time say: 'Let the people choose again'. This is becoming repetitive. The Opposition is not prepared to accept the umpire's decision then, a decision which they called for and got in clear terms. The country cannot afford this stay of proceedings week by week while the Opposition takes time off to sift through every scandal in which it can become involved. The country cannot afford that luxury. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> was quick to point out that the cost of the Government's propaganda machine was $lm a month. I believe that is far too much. But what does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> think his action and his vote in this chamber will have cost the Australian community by Christmas. Will it be as little as $ 1 m a month? By Christmas he conceivably will be costing the Australian community $ 100m a month. That is the charge which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> will put on this community to obtain what he wants. </para>

            <para>- I do not know who sent them. I suspect that they are not members of the Liberal Movement. The words that are being used consistently by leading spokesmen for the Opposition are 'we want'. That means the Liberal Party of Australia wants and not the people of Australia. The Liberal Party wants an election not for the greater good of this country but so that it can get into office and its leading spokesmen can be Ministers.

        <para>As I have said, those are the smaller issues that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> went into at great length. But they are not the issues now. The issue now is simply whether a lower House is the place where a government is formed in Australia from here on in. That is the real issue. I am, as I have said previously, extremely disturbed that our side of politics, which was showing a complete supremacy over its Labor adversaries, has suddenly surrendered the torch of principle to those adversaries and has given them the principle to uphold whilst our side tries to drag it down. That is what I regret so much about the political dogfight. The issue at stake is whether a government is formed in the lower House. I should have thought that the issue was settled long ago. </para>
        <para>There is perhaps one issue which does stand out among the detail in this argument and that is the loans affair. There is no doubt that the Opposition has made it the central issue, the central factor, of its charge against the Government. It has lived for some months now in times of great controversy whilst this matter has been sifted through and 2 Ministers have lost their jobs. I believe it reflects great discredit on the Government that it should have been involved with the backyard financiers of that unknown and guaranteed or, should I say, untouched for world in London and other capital cities. The Government , of course, has incurred its own penalty for getting involved with those people. The victims of that are the Australian people in the form of the challenge which has now been put up on this matter by the Opposition. </para>
        <para>What is the Government's position now in this issue? As I have said, 2 Ministers have gone. The Opposition has adopted those very people that first took the Government in these negotiations. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> is now the possession of the Opposition- of the Liberal Party. I suppose that he is today closeted somewhere eating potato crisps and having his 8 bulging briefcases examined by senior assistants to Liberal Party shadow Ministers. He is the possession of the Liberal Party. I cannot for the life of me see why the LiberalParty has not proceeded to support his presence in the Senate, as I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said last week he would do. It seems to me to be very much a matter of very shallow politics indeed that his presence here to settle this issue depends on whether his bulging briefcases favour the Liberal Party. That appears to be the extent of the Liberal Party's interest in this issue. </para>
        <para>Today <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has given notice that he intends to move for the setting up of a select committee of 3 members from each political side. I notice that he has very prominently ignored the two of us who do not belong to either of the two major political sides in this House. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has suggested that it may be time to have this question examined before a restricted but proper number of the House of Representatives. In some circumstances I could agree with that examination, but it is a position which has been totally confused now with, as I have said, the Opposition being in possession of the chief negotiator who was previously dealing with the Government. The issue is now resting on innuendo and on documents whose validity is unknown and untouched for. We have had the leading protagonists in the argument using the word 'purported'. I notice that in the House of Representatives on 22 October, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> said: </para>

There are 7 purported telex messages on the International Message Form of the 'Australian Diplomatic Network' and one on a normal tear-off sheet, They all contain mysterious and, I suppose, interesting references. When I received them I enlisted the assistance of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> and asked him to check whether they were valid telex copies.

          <para>It is true that with one exception the Department's form has been used. However, the person employing the form is revealed to have no knowledge whatsoever about how to use the various boxes at the top of the form. The way in which they have been used amounts, in fact, to gibberish. Furthermore, all Departments and all Ministers' offices have supplies of the Department 's form '. </para>

            <para>-Incredible. I have a copy of a letter on what purports to be the letterhead of the Union Bank of Switzerland. Later I will table it, with the Senate's permission. I do not believe it is a genuine letter. I say that. Certainly the people who are mentioned in it can make their own assessment of whether it is a genuine letter. It should not take long to find that out. Are people either counterfeiting or stealing the business letterheads of prominent firms, making up bogus letters and sending them around the highways and byways of our capital cities or back around London? Is this what is in the bulging briefcases? Is this the standard? Is this the standard on which the Opposition is basing its argument? I will read out this letter. </para>

        <para class="block">The signature is torn off, if there was one. One would tend to throw away these things if the package had not contained a telex that had been reproduced in a newspaper. I have another letter which intrigues me even further, but I do not think I will bother to read it. Later I will ask for leave to table it so that senators can study it for themselves. It is an unsigned letter, as the torn off portion shows. It is addressed to George, not Dear George. It has 'Tuesday' on it. It is undated. It is on., of all things, paper headed ' Minister for State Development and Decentralisation' for the Victorian Government. </para>
        <para>This argument is becoming a comic opera. A man leaves a trail of potato crisps all the way from London, through the Middle East to Sydney. He has eight bulging briefcases. He is closeted for hours with chief advisers of the Opposition, one of whom then makes a statement which embarrasses his Leader and exonerates the Prime Minister. Last week the Opposition said that it would facilitate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani's</inline> appearance before the Senate. Now apparently the Opposition does not want to facilitate his appearance. Today it moved a motion for the setting up a select committee which may or may not proceed, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said. This matter has become a comic opera, but the people of Australia are held to ransom because of it. They are held to ransom because the Opposition has adopted the theme 'We want'. </para>

        <para>Having reached this stage, it is obvious that we must do what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> said. We must set up some sort of inquiry into this matter and let the Budget pass. This should be the strategy of the Opposition today. There is no way we can ascertain the facts of this matter in the next week, the next fort night or the next month. No sensible senator who knows how committees work and how long investigations take and who looks back and sees how long this investigation of the loans affair has taken so far could legitimately and properly say that one could obtain the facts of this case in time to use them as a matter of ransom on this Budget. There is no way it could be done. The only proper course for the Opposition to take in this matter is to set up a committee of inquiry which will finally elicit all the facts on how both sides of politics have behaved about the loans affair so we can know the facts without there being the pressure of this community being held to ransom on the economic front. In the meantime there is only one thing the Opposition can do, and that is to pass the Budget and get on with the economic reconstruction of Australia. I ask for leave to table the documents from which I have read and an additional one which I have not read and which is on the letterhead of the Minister for State Development and Decentralisation. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir MAGNUS</inline>CORMACK (Victoria) (4.19)- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I apologise for not rising immediately. I was interested in the claim for these papers to be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> You would readily understand that one of the matters which was going through my mind was the complication which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> seemed to indicate could arise in the incorporation truthfully of these documents. I assume that it is possible. I was cogitating on this matter when you called me. I am sorry I was slow in getting to my feet. </para>
        <para>The second matter that interested me was that when I came into the chamber to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> make his speech I noticed that, for the first time since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> was appearing before the Bar of the Senate, the Senate Press gallery was full with Pressmen. I was interested to discover what it was that attracted the Press into the gallery so quickly. However, understandably, they very quickly left the Press gallery and are not there to listen to me. Perhaps the sooner they leave the better I can get on with my speech. </para>
        <para>I was interested in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall's</inline> speech because I recollect quite clearly- the information I asked for was provided to me- that on 16 July this year the honourable senator who has just resumed his seat said, as reported in the second column of page 2756 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard:</inline></para>
        <quote>
          <para>If the Government is able to frustrate this move - </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is, the calling of witnesses before the Bar of the Senate-  something else will happen. If I were in the Opposition's position I would adjourn the Senate until 1 January next year and let the people decide in the meantime. </para>
        <para class="block">Like the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> the honourable senator is entitled to change his mind. When the Prime Minister was challenged in the House of Representatives on the attitude he would take towards the Senate in the context of the Appropriation Bills, he put down that tremendous constitutional and legal advice that it was the duty of the Government to resign, but when questioned again on the same matter the other week in the other place it was found that he had changed his mind. I assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> is entitled to change his mind. </para>
        <para>I want to make this clear: There has descended quite deliberately on the Australian electorate at the present moment a vast fog of words emanating from the office of the Prime Minister of Australia and many of his Ministers in their attempt to confuse the issue that is now before the Senate. There are 2 matters involved in this issue, I suggest. The first is that the Prime Minister is promoting a concept which is novel, at least in parliamentary terms, over the past 300 years. In essence, stripped of all the verbiage, all the antics, all the hamming, all the acting, all the strutting, it is a belief in the divine right of Prime Ministers. Our parliamentary system evolved from the concept of the divine right of kings, but that was broken 300 years ago with the great struggle between the Parliament and the Crown. For the first time since those days there has now intervened in Australia the concept of the divine right of Prime Ministers to rule. That divine right, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> my friend, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, mentioned, is in essence the concept that the only person entitled to proffer advice to  His Excellency  the Governor-General, despite all the matters that are embedded in the Constitution, is the Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> solemnly advanced the argument that the only person who is entitled to advise the Governor-General on any matter is the Prime Minister. In essence, what the Prime Minister is advancing is that the single decision making element in the Constitution is the Prime Minister of the day. It is not the Prime Minister of the day. This decision-making element in the Constitution, outside the prerogative power, is the Parliament. The Parliament is exerting here in this chamber a struggle against what I have referred to as the divine right of Prime Ministers. </para>
        <para>There are events which occurred last year. I suppose it is not outside common knowledge that I was not very happy with the circumstances which occurred last year, but in the end I voted for the proposition, even though I sat in the seat which you now occupy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> My recollection- I am sure it is the recollection of every honourable senator here- was that the then Leader of the Opposition asked on a Wednesday that the Prime Minister should consider taking the Senate and the House of Representatives to an election. On a Thursday the Prime Minister- this was well publicised- went to Government House and obtained a dissolution of both Houses of the Parliament. It can be argued one way or the other whether the decision which was made in the Senate was the right one or the wrong one. There was a double dissolution and, in the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland this afternoon, the Prime Minister was returned with a majority of 3 seats out of 127 seats in the House of Representatives and in the Senate there was a balance which was not in favour of the Government. In other words, the people made a decision inside the terms of the Constitution and awarded to the Senate a supervisory power from the time of that election to the present day. </para>
        <para>But that argument is irrelevant because there arose in February of this year, as honourable senators will recollect, the first rumours of a massive attempt to raise money for temporary purposes. That was the result of the infamous so-called Executive Council meeting that took place on that night in December. I am sure no honourable senator sitting on the Government side is any more happy than I am that an attempt was made to obtain from the Executive Council, when the Vice-President of the Executive Council was not present, a minute to authorise one Minister to raise a loan of $4,000m. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies made mention in a statement which he issued last week of the kerbside opinion put down by the Attorney-General of the day, who will be well remembered by honourable senators, that the money could be ascribed as being for temporary purposes. Then the Senate proceeded to go to work to try to discover the real facts that lay behind that Executive Council minute and the mandate that was extended to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor.</inline></para>
        <para>Eventually that culminated in an attempt by the Senate to bring before the Bar of the Senate some public servants in order to throw some light, through them, upon this murky constitutional process that had taken place. Ever since that day this chamber has been frustrated by the Prime Minister. This chamber was frustrated on that day, and it was frustrated because the Prime Minister directed the public servants to refuse to answer questions addressed to them by the Senate of Australia. I have put down some submissions to the Senate Standing Committee on Privileges on this matter. I came clearly to the opinion, which has not been contravened by anyone as far as I can discover, that the Prime Minister in that instance behaved illegally. He had no right to make threats or to issue instructions to public servants appearing before the Bar of the Senate to refuse to answer questions, and the reason that he had no right to do that is that there was no Crown privilege involved. Crown privilege derives from what is known as the prerogative power. It is an undefined power, except in relation to certain areas where the definition is clear and concise. It is this: The prerogative power does not extend to any area that is barred by the Constitution or is barred by statute. It is clear and demonstrable that the issue of such a minute from the Executive Council directly contravenes section 105a of the Constitution. </para>
        <para>We were able to extract some further information that the money was for temporary purposes, which was manifestly a lie. So we had the curious situation of the Prime Minister directing public servants appearing before this chamber to refuse to answer questions on the basis that to do so would be a breach of Crown privilege, whereas in fact the Prime Minister himself was in breach of the Constitution as he was claiming privilege for an area in which there existed no privilege because an illegal act had occurred. The Senate has been pursuing that matter in the interests of the people whom it is elected to represent. There are some subsequent chapters in this story. Question after question was asked. As the Parliament probed in another place and in this place more and more started to filter out, although we all recall that the Prime Minister had stated that the last of the information had been disclosed and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, who is not present in the chamber at the moment, made that famous or infamous statement on television, that the Australian electorate or the people of Australia had learned all that they are entitled to know- a quality of arrogance that has not been seen for a long time. In my time, anyway, I have never seen it. </para>
        <para>What happened after that? We then got into another curious situation, the one to which reference already has been made this week. I refer to the ACTU-Solo operation where 400 000-odd barrels of oil disappeared into the embrace of a company that was created shortly after a court case was held in Victoria. We have been trying to probe that. I wonder what was in the minds of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland yesterday when they spoke in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> It is very interesting to go over the report of the proceedings in the Senate yesterday. At page 1477 of yesterday's Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> is reported as saying: </para>

        <para>We are not in a great constitutional crisis in the sense that has been advocated and argued by Government senators or by Government supporters in another place, but we are in a crisis where the authority of the Parliament is being directly challenged by the Prime Minister who refuses to disclose to the Australian people the elements of corruption which involve him or some of his Ministers, whom he has acknowledged were involved in it in the last 12 months- since December 1973. Parliament is entitled to this information. Parliament is entitled to know whether it can place its trust in the Government. Parliament is entitled to know whether it should provide money for a government which has been demonstrably found out to be unworthy of holding the seals of office which have been accorded to it. An obscure fog has been thrown over things by the Government propaganda machine. Various groups throughout the community have been encouraged to hold meetings and to send letters and telegrams saying that the convention has been breached. No convention has been breached. What has been activated and motivated at the present time is the Senate which, for the first time in 75 years, has had to reach for the constitutional power that is given to it to deal with matters of the high and scandalous nature with which we are involved. I have no hesitation in supporting the amendment that has been moved. I hope that now and forever the scribblers around this place will go and report, which they will not, that there is no one in the Opposition in the Senate at the moment - </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline>by his recent actions has lost even respect. In the <inline font-style="italic">National Times</inline> on 21 February 1972 there appeared an article written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr D.</inline> J. Killen. Honourable senators will remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Killen</inline> was a very strong supporter of the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Gorton.

          <para>One of the worst infringements of the conventions of cabinet government which has ever occurred took place in Australia. </para>
          <para>In March 1971 Malcolm Fraser resigned from the Gorton Government. The ostensible reason he gave to Parliament for his resignation was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> did not repudiate a report involving <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser.</inline></para>
          <para>Views on that issue remain unsettled. But the really remarkable part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser's</inline> speech lay in his criticism of an incident that took place eight months before his resignation. </para>
          <para>In his speech to Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> claimed that a plan was prepared in July 1970, for a call-out of the Pacific Islands Regiment to deal with possible confrontation with the Mataungan Association in the Gazelle Peninsula. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline>further claimed that he knew nothing of the plan until July 14, and that the plan had not been approved of by the Cabinet. </para>
          <para> <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> himself admitted that the Cabinet did meet on July 19, and he, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> signed the call-out order. </para>

              <para>. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> had felt aggrieved by any action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> regarding the call-out order, then he should have promptly resigned. He chose not to. He let eight months go by before voicing his complaint.  . . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> chose to ignore a fundamental convention of government.

          <para class="block">Dear Jim, </para>
          <para>Cannot you get it across to Gough that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kemlani,</inline> is a con man and on his own admission a deserter to the Japanese, like thousands of his countrymen in the last war, therefore a deserter from the British Forces. </para>
          <para>On his own admission in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline> he interrogated Australian Prisoners of War on behalf of the Japanese and therefore a War Criminal, because you know full well what they meant by interrogation on the Burma Railway. </para>
          <para>Why on earth was a War Criminal given a visa to this Country, and no wonder he never left his Hotel, he just may have run into someone who remembered the men of our Army who were kicked to death by Indian and Pakistani deserters, or is their memory too short. The  Asia  is also strangely silent on the Subject, but kick up a great fuss about the attempts of the Labor Council in Brisbane about the realignment of Anzac Square with the cry 'Lest we Forget'. Well the people have forgotten pretty smartly. </para>
          <para>Kemlani is also a Undischarged Bankrupt in Wales to the tune of £8 1 5,000, wi.th a few odd thousand thrown in. </para>
          <para>Have him grabbed as soon as he returns and see the results. They hanged a Japanese General who never personally hurt anyone, yet this fellow is given the V.I.P. treatment by the opposition. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That statement was made by a man who is a prominent businessman and who travels around the world a fair bit. I think perhaps the Khemlani incident is summed up in the cartoon which appeared this morning in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> It shows the unpacking of all the ports producing one pair of dirty underpants, with the statement: Is this all you've got?' </para>
        <para>All those statements prove the pertinent point that not only is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> in a situation where he can lead his Party into wrecking the economy of this country and wrecking the lives of thousands of people, but also that he was a totally deceitful Minister in the days when he held a portfolio. They prove that today he is a dishonest leader because he is setting two standards, two sets of principles. He is a totally devious man and he is no longer respected by the Australian people. It is going to be only a matter of time before he is toppled from the leadership by his own Party. I suspect that within the next 8 or 10 weeks the Liberal Party will elect a new leader. The man standing in the wings, of course, has the same failings and excesses as his current leader. Nevertheless, he is much more suitable to the multinationals and others who are guiding the policies of the Liberal Party today. </para>
        <para>We have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> and others, and it is significant- <inline font-style="italic">{Quorum formed)</inline> I think there is a matter of great significance here. There is tremendous turmoil in the Liberal Party at the moment. Every possible moment has to be spent in party meetings. It is noticeable that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bessell</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> were the only 2 members of the Liberal Party who happened to be in the House. The other 27 were missing completely. They are either away having Party meetings or some of them are down in the bar working out their miseries. There has been much play over a considerable period of time by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> and a couple of others on that side of the chamber who have been crying about the Press. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack got up in this chamber this afternoon and abused the members of the Press Gallery and was most dissatisfied when they walked out. I want to quote from a statement that was made last Saturday, 26 October, on radio station 2JJ, the station that is much maligned by honourable senators on the other side of the chamber. This is a statement made by a journalist: </para>

          <para>The Australian is being run at the moment by a very strange man who gets orders every day from Rupert Murdoch in New York. This man is not the editor. In a few short months he has wrecked the Australian 's reputation as a responsible, intelligent paper. </para>
          <para>In the past few weeks the following things have happened: Every headline on a political story is vetted by 2 top men, and made as anti- Whitlam as possible. The letters columns have been censored to give a false impression of the anger and strength of Labor's support in the crisis. </para>
          <para>Yesterday the Australian had some excellent pictures of Whitlam 's rally . . . pictures which, under any normal application of news values, would have been used prominently on page 1. These pictures were not allowed to be published. </para>
          <para>The Australian also had a story on the Whitlam rally. This was 'spiked' too, because again it illustrated how many people supported Whitlam 's stand. A top executive badgered reporters, telling them the story would not be used unless they could find someone who would estimate the crowd at less than half the official estimates . . . 7000 instead of the 16000 . . . </para>

          <para>From the birth of the Commonwealth until 1974 no Senate had rejected, or deferred indefinitely, a money Bill. Since 1911 it has been generally accepted that the upper House in every British-style parliament has no power to do so. That this is an unwritten part of our Constitution only makes it the more important. </para>
          <para>By its action the Senate has set an example which places social order and democratic government itself in jeopardy. The Governor of Queensland has already been encouraged to improve on the Senate's lesson by committing a gross breach of that political impartiality which it is the first duty of the Queen's representative to uphold, lt will be astonishing if such exalted examples of wrongdoing do not provoke emulation in other quarters. If the Senate succeeds in imposing its will on the House of Representatives then future governments, whatever their political principles, could be forced to an election every six months. No government on earth could perform its work responsibly and efficiently under such circumstances; yet this is the situation which the Senate majority, by its present actions, is inevitably bringing into existence. </para>

        <para>I was disappointed today when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> made his contribution to the debate. I know for a fact that every Aborigine in Australia has suffered as a result of the holding up of these money Bills in the Senate by the Liberal and National Country parties. I know that every Aborigine in Australia who has enough money for the cost of a telegram, a letter or a telephone call has been contacting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> begging him to relieve the distress which Aborigines are suffering at this time. My final comment will be upon the contribution made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack. He talked in a rhetorical way about the scandals of the Government. He must have a very short memory. I wonder whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack remembers the scandal of the VIP flights when he in the Senate and a Minister and a Prime Minister in another place suppressed information for week after week. It was only because one man in the Liberal Party who has since been expelled from the Party was able to bring forward information that the matter was cleaned up. </para>
        <para>I wonder if the honourable senator remembers the story of a Prime Minister- the last Liberal Prime Minister or Tory Prime Minister that this country is going to see for a long time- who, associated with friends, was able to do a very shady deal on the sale of aeroplanes owned by a so-called Jet-Air company. I wonder if the honourable senator remembers the money brokers in New York who have done a lot to bring about this crisis because they feared that there might have been other areas from which this Government might raise its overseas loan. For years certain people have been getting a pay-off at the hands of the Liberal Party. It has gone on year after year in the foreign money raising field. I wonder if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> remembers the 500 kids that he and the members of his Party killed in Vietnam.  His  Party entered into a war for which it could find no justification by way of correspondence. It was when we became the Government that the present Opposition admitted that in fact there had been no real invitation from South Vietnam. I wonder if honourable senators opposite remember how in 1963 millions of dollars of Australian taxpayers' money was committed to buy the FI 1 1 as a political gimmick. The plane has now been delivered. It was a deal which the Labor Party was committed to go ahead with. Nevertheless, the plane is not as satisfactory as it ought to be and it is much more expensive than this country can afford with the amount of defence that it is able to maintain. I submit again that the moral duty, the legal duty, the conventional duty, and the duty in accordance with political customs, of members of the Opposition is to let these 2 Bills through at the end of this debate and to cease the misery that the Opposition is causing everybody in this country. </para>

            <para>-That was today. This is the gallup poll that was quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland earlier. If those figures had been reversed I would not think there would be very much risk that the Government would not do what the amendment asks of it. It is purely a question of numbers- that is what politics is all about. I think the gallup poll results are indicative of the reasons for the Government on this occasion resisting going to the people and asking them again for their judgment on the Government's record over the last 14 to 16 months. On the previous occasion the gallup polls seem to be fairly accurate and the Government went rather willingly to the people. On this occasion, when it has been asked to submit itself again to the judgment of the people, with the gallup polls not showing the support for the Government that they were showing on the previous occasion, we see the Government refusing to accept the challenge and go to the people. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunton</inline> said earlier, the democratic place is the people's place and it is the people who make the decision.

            <para>-Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> I thought I was starting to give one of the reasons why this Government should stand condemned for lack of action in this field. It has been very obvious that right throughout the term of its office the Government has disregarded the welfare of one section of the community, the section of the community engaged in primary industry. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">A lot of things have happened in primary industry, many of them of course beyond the control of government. They are related to international market fluctuations, prices and matters over which the Australian Government has no control or very little control. But the Government has an important responsibility of rather large magnitude. We have seen the wool industry go through a period of problems which have been somewhat overcome. We have seen the beef industry facing a major problem. Again there has been no action taken notwithstanding the report of the Industries Assistance Commission which has suggested certain measures that the Government may take to assist or alleviate the situation in some part at least. Unfortunately, all too recently exactly the same situation developed in the dairying industry. Because of the enormous buildup and stockpile of powdered milk the dairying industry, in some instances, is receiving up to 10c a lb less for butterfat in milk than it was receiving at this time last year. </para>
        <para>I come back to the topic I was discussing before I was interrupted and that is the situation we have in the potato industry. This industry has been of extreme importance to the people in the area particularly where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> and I live. It is important not only to the people in that part of Tasmania but also to people in many other parts of the Commonwealth. It is an industry which has been up and down. It has fluctuated wildly due to seasonal conditions, disease and market price. One of the big problems this industry faces at the present moment arises from the importation of enormous amounts of frozen french fries and the Government has taken no action of any sort to exercise any degree of restraint. These imports have been coming into the country at prices which are very competitive for the home grown product. </para>
        <para>Naturally the home grown product is the best product. But it suffers the disadvantage of being grown in an area where costs are increasing rapidly. Freight charges are going up. The cost of fertiliser has gone up because of the withdrawal of the bounty. The cost of wages, machinery and fuel has gone up. Of necessity these increases must be reflected in what can be accepted as the cost of the product. Over and above that is the profit margin, if any is left to the growers. But what has happened in the last 12 months? An enormous amount of produce of this kind has been allowed into the country, and notwithstanding questions that have been asked from both sides of the chamber of the Minister for Police and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh)</inline> and of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> when he was Minister for </para>
        <para class="block">Agriculture, no effective Government action has yet been taken to limit or to control in any way the volume of the imports. This has had a tremendously important effect on the industry. </para>
        <para>In large parts of Tasmania- and I guess the same applies to some other parts of Australia- an evolution is taking place in the potato growing industry in that the State is starting to process rather large quantities of potatoes. In one instance a factory had purchased the machinery to undertake this processing. It left the machinery in storage and subsequently made alternative arrangements. This denied to the people who lived in that area an opportunity for further employment. This happened in a situation where we see something like 300 000 people out of work in Australia. Because the Government has not taken any action we look with some doubt at the record of the Government in accepting or acting upon any of the IAC reports with regard to rural industry. We note that a few months ago- in fact, I think it was in July of this year- the Special Minister of State on 1 1 July 1975 sent a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission on the question of long term assistance to this industry in terms of supplying both the fresh market and the local processing market.  His  response to a question I asked him this morning- I did not know at that time that I would have an opportunity to discuss this matter- made it fairly evident that no quick answer would come from the IAC. It may well be that the Commission's report, when it comes, will be valuable as so many other reports have been. But if the Government refuses to accept or just ignores the reports, it is fairly obvious that referring matters to the Commission is a waste of time and a waste <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the expertise which the IAC has built up in recent years. </para>
        <para>We have seen a number of these reports. I mentioned some of them briefly a few moments ago. They are all excellent reports. The then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> who is now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy, also sent a reference to the IAC when it was his responsibility with regard to the situation in the tomato industry'. I shall quote a brief section from the recommendations to indicate the sort of action which I feel could be of tremendous value to the potato industry. I do not know whether any action has yet been taken on this recommendation. </para>
        <para>The recommendation states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The landed cost of imports- </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Of course this refers to tomatoes and not potatoes-  under by-law are equated with an established local price. This could be achieved by the duty free admission of that portion of each shipment (the balance being subject to the full substantive duty) as is necessary to arrive at a composite landed into store cost over the whole importation equal to the established local price; and conditions to prevent stockpiling of the goods are imposed. </para>
        <para class="block">Further in the report it states quite clearly and categorically that the recommendation of the Commission is that, should any produce come in under lowered tariff, that must be cleared from the market before the next season begins so as not to interfere in any way at all with the cost in the subsequent year. </para>
        <para>This has not happened in the potato industry. This matter is of very grave import to the people in my State. When we look at the figures supplied by the Department of Manufacturing Industry we realise that the figures given as importations last year represent in total 65 per cent of the average production of Tasmania over the last few years. Fairly obviously, importations of that size will have a marked effect. That has had the effect of virtually destroying both the fresh market and the processed market in Tasmania. We know that it costs $40 a tonne to send potatoes on the direct sea route to the Sydney market, which is the main market for the fresh produce. I am not sure of the figure for imports from America to Australia. I imagine it is somewhat lower than the figure I have given. This gives the imported product a marked advantage. We do know that on occasions this year processed potatoes from Canada and the United States of America were being sold at a retail price that was about 10c lower than the local product. Of course this does not take into consideration the cost incurred in the processing in either country. The effect this year in Tasmania I guess the same applies to many of the other States- has been that plantings are down markedly on what they have been as an average over the past several years. </para>
        <para>I know that importations of this size were a result of a low yield in the market during the 1974 harvest season.'But if the industry had been covered by and controlled by a tariff and an import restriction we would not have seen this situation continue into the harvest season for the Australian product. I shall cite some of the more pertinent figures supplied by the Department of Manufacturing Industry. I shall seek leave to have the table incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> We note that in October of last year 2 441 270 kilos of potatoes came into Australia. In the following month, November, the amount was 3 599 283 kilos. In December the amount was 2.8 million in round figures and there was a jump to 3.7 million in January. </para>
        <para>The total quantity of frozen potatoes imported was 15 941 113 kilograms. This is an enormous quantity. What is more important is the value of these imports which was money denied to the Australian growers, many of whom this year have ploughed their potatoes into the ground or have ploughed them up for stock feed. The value of those imports was $5,71 9,639. There are other small imports with relative values, such as flour, meal and flake. The total for those imports was 1 274 579 kilograms valued at $973,813. This gives a total importation of 17 215 682 kilograms worth $6,693,442. Fairly obviously those figures should indicate to the Senate the damage which these imports can do to an industry and the damage which has been done to it. This threat is staring the potato growers in the face in the forthcoming year. What is even more disturbing is a telegram dated 25 July 1975 which was sent to one of the people in the trade regarding potato stocks and prices in the United States of America. </para>

        <para class="block">Fairly obviously unless the Government acts quickly we will be faced with the possibility of these stocks being unloaded onto the Australian market and it may well be- I do not wish to preempt in any way the recommendations on the report of the Industries Assistance Commissionthat the Commission will bring down a recommendation somewhat similar to the one I referred to with regard to tomatoes. If the Government does not take on board what I have said and does not do something about it we will see during this current year- most areas are already planting; that is, the few that are planting- a complete breakdown in this industry which has provided a valuable cash crop for many people in many parts of Tasmania and other States. It is an opportunity for the dairy farmer, who is receiving up to 10c a pound butterfat less than he was at this time last year, to earn something from his property during the winter months when his cows are not in production. </para>
        <para>I have discussed this problem briefly with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> and he is not unsympathetic to the view that some control and a careful watch must be kept on this industry. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> was the Minister for Agriculture he set up a national potato advisory panel to keep himself and the Department of Agriculture informed of the growers' wants, needs and problems in the coming years. I ask the Government to look after this primary industry and not let it get ground down and subjugated by massive imports of potatoes so that this industry which at one time was an extremely valuable industry to Australia is not destroyed. </para>

            <para>-That is right. The country did grow on it, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> said. He and I well know the magnificent areas in which we both live that are capable of and suitable for this type of production. It is an extremely important industry to the north-west coast. It is one that has potential for an enormous expansion into the frozen foods area. Nowadays people seem to prefer to buy french fries rather than peel potatoes. If we are to keep down the cost to the consumer obviously we have to go into volume production. The only way by which we can do that is by maintaining an industry which is viable and in which the volume of production is such that the unit costs can be brought back to a level which is not going to make it unreasonable. I ask the Government to have a careful look at this matter and to watch that the imports in the coming few months do not escalate like they did at this time last year. </para>

        <para>If a situation like the one that occurred last season is not avoided people are going to go out of the industry completely in one or two seasons. The side effects of that are fairly obvious. It would affect the people who are manufacturing machinery. It would affect the people who are manufacturing containers. I heard the Minister for Police and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh)</inline> answering a question this morning with regard to the importation of jute packing. This is used quite extensively in the potato industry, particularly the fresh side of the industry. There are very many people who would be affected by the destruction of the industry. An industry that is destroyed by the lack of competent government action is an industry that is not going to have very much faith in anybody who is watching over it. The Government has a responsibility to every aspect of industry, whether it be primary or secondary. If it is going to abrogate that responsibility it may well be, as this amendment says, that it is time it went to the people for their verdict. </para>

            <para>-After I had spoken this afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack read a passage which inferred that I had said that the Budget should be defeated and that I had since changed my mind. By way of interjection <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said: 'He has seen the gallup poll'. The general inference of that was that I had changed my mind in the 24 hours since the publication of a gallup poll which showed an upsurge in Labor support. The facts of the matter in relation to any public stance on this are that what was said in the heat of the debate here on the loans affair was completely superseded by a public statement in which I was joined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunton</inline> in this chamber on 1 1 September- many weeks before the Budget was presented- when it was made quite clear by the two of us that we would not support the defeat or deferral of the Budget. It was subsequently confirmed in a letter of warning I wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser on, I think, the first of this month or early in this month. Therefore the situation is quite clear. There has been no recent change of view. There was a clear public statement weeks before the Budget was presented. This matter is not subject to the wilful misconstructions that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> usually puts on these matters if he can get away with it. </para>

          <para>-The Senate is debating a motion for the restoration of the Appropriation Bills to the notice paper so that the Senate might again grapple with the question of whether the Opposition wishes to continue delaying the passage of the Budget. It is now 2 weeks since the Opposition first announced its intention to delay the Budget in the Senate. Since that announcement was made many speeches have been made in the Senate about the course of conduct on which the Opposition has embarked. At this stage the debate might normally be very tedious. It would be but for the very grave consequences of the course which the Opposition has adopted and but for the line of argument which the Opposition has followed in its tortuous search for reprehensible circumstances to try to justify that criterion which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> laid down when he was elected Leader of the Opposition and from which he has since departed. In the course of that tortuous and tedious search for reprehensible circumstances we have had references in this chamber and elsewhere to the loans crisis; to the ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd matter; to the Khemlani crisis, the new crisis which has been inflicted on the Liberal Party; to an alleged decline in ministerial standards, the charges being made by persons who have the most reprehensible record in this regard; and today to the <inline font-style="italic">post facto</inline> suggestion of reprehensible circumstances which arises from the charge of a Budget leak by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> revealed long after the decision to delay the Budget had been made. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>So we have this long list of Opposition endeavours to try to justify the unprecedented action which it has taken; an action which has been taken for the first time in 75 years of Australian federation. It is all very well for people to quote Government spokesmen when they were in Opposition saying that the proper course might be to defer a budget or a Supply Bill or to vote against a Supply Bill or the proper course might be for a government to resign. It is all very well to cite all these things and to try to avoid the reality of the situation, which is this: Although those threats have been made in the past in the course of party political bluff, although comments of that sort have been made, this is the first time that this action has happened. I mention what we are debating because people might be pardoned for deciding that we are talking about something altogether different. For the first time, to that long list of attempted reprehensible circumstances to which I have referred, we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bessell</inline> from Tasmania introducing an entirely new reprehensible circumstance- the condition of the potato industry. Not content with that as a try-on as a possible reprehensible circumstance, he then referred to the situation of the tomato industry as a possible alternative reprehensible circumstance, as a possible reason for delaying the Budget. These are new and unique suggestions from the Opposition which we will no doubt have to devote a few more days to debate. After dealing at length with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> after dealing at length in the Senate with the ACTU-Solo matter and the residue of the so-called loans crisis, we are now confronted with a new situation- that of the potato industry. </para>
        <para>The Budget is being delayed on the basis of these alleged circumstances. It is being delayed, and it is the effect of that delay on the whole of Australia, on the people of Australia and on the economy which is of gravest concern both to the Government and to the people, I believe. The Budget, which contains the economic program of the Government, had a number of important aspects about it. It proposed, first of all, significant cuts in the level of government expenditure. It proposed a deficit of the order of a deficit suggested by all the commentators on economic matters and as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> himself as an appropriate parameter in which the deficit might be. </para>
        <para>The Budget was designed to encourage investment. Furthermore, it was designed to encourage spending and to put more money into the pockets of the people in the community by the proposed taxation cuts. The system of concessions was to be abolished and replaced by a rebate system which was much fairer and much more equitable and which would mean that every Australian would from 1 January 1976 be subject to a different tax system for the first time in 30 years. It would mean that half a million Australians would pay no tax at all. It would mean, furthermore, that many taxpayers in the middle income range would pay significantly less tax than they have paid previously. It would mean particularly that the family man would benefit considerably from the tax concessions proposed. Those are one or two positive aspects of the Budget which I feel it worth mentioning, because in all the furore about the price of potatoes and these various matters which have been raised in the debate today it is important to remember what is happening: The Budget is being delayed. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Senator Chaney</inline>is to be congratulated. That is one of the best interjections I have heard in the whole course of the Budget debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney,</inline> summoning up all of his courage, suggests that the Government has had its chips. By the way that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> has looked in the last couple of weeks I would have thought that it was somebody else who might have had his chips. I will be coming to him in a minute, and I intend to deal with him at some length. I think the popular consensus is that perhaps that other gentleman has had his chips. But I am relating my remarks to the Budget. </para>

        <para>The point I want to make about the Budget which is being delayed with its positive aspects is that every independent economic commentator in this country has given some credit at least to the Budget and given a lot of credit in many circumstances. Since the Budget was brought down the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> has referred consistently to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser's</inline> problem. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser's</inline> problem, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review,</inline> is to bring up an alternative Budget proposal which is a viable one. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser's</inline> problem is to explain how he will cut government expenditure in a satisfactory manner- in a manner which will produce the results which he hopes for and which will not produce a greatly exaggerated degree of unemployment in Australia. That is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser's</inline> problem- or, indeed, it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser's</inline> problem until he embarked upon this absurd and totally unprincipled course of delaying the Budget. Now he has a new problem. </para>
        <para>I mention the Budget because that is what this debate is all about. I would say that the Budget has been acclaimed by independent experts as a positive and sensible one in the fight back to restore the economic situation in this country. The delay in blocking the Budget does nothing more than contribute to the economic malaise about which the Opposition senators have been talking for months. It can do nothing more than that. It has a drastic effect in contributing to business uncertainty and in contributing to all sorts of factors which upset the possibility of the proper working of the Budget and the restoration of a reasonable economic situation in this country. One must ask these questions: How sincere is the Opposition about inflation? How sincere is the Opposition about unemployment? How sincere is the Opposition about economic management? </para>
        <para>These issues about which the Opposition used to criticise and carp have not even been referred to very much in the course of this debate. Rather it has been concerned about all sorts of matters such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd and the potato industry. Some years ago this technique used to be called Sukarnoism and what it amounted to was simply an attempt to divert attention from gross ineptitude and mismanagement by raising all sorts of other issues which were totally irrelevant to the real concerns of the people. So we have had, as I say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> trotted back to Australia twice as though that had some relevance to the real concerns of the people and the issues with which the Budget is concerned. This attempt by the Opposition to withdraw attention from its own inadequacies, from the inadequacies of its own economic proposals and from the inadequacies of the programs on various matters which have rather abortively been put forward in the last few weeks is a classic case of Sukarnoism </para>
        <para>This leads me to consider for a moment the tragic decline in performance and standards of this once great Party- the Liberal Party of Australia. I think we all understand that there are 2 great traditions in the Liberal Party. There is the tradition., the mythology of the Liberal Party as the upholder of convention in Australia and the upholder of enlightened conservatism, of alternative policies and of addiction to principle and to fair play in order that the parliamentary system might survive as the basic institution of democracy as we know it. That is the myth of the Liberal Party Opposition- that it is the upholder of convention. 1 do not wish to go into the rather turgid details with which we have dealt previously in the Senate concerning the Liberal Party's failure to comply with the great conventions of parliamentary democracy. I do not have much material to go on to discuss the Liberal Party's alternative policies because we do not really know what they are. All we know are the various matters which I have mentioned, which the Liberal Party has tried to raise to. the level of reprehensible circumstances. The reality of the Liberal Party as distinct from the myths which I have mentioned is that in 1974, 18 months after this Government came to office, it embarked upon the course, which had never been embarked upon before in Australia, of saying: Stand and deliver. Give us a double dissolution election or we will refuse Supply'. Subsequently, on 2 occasions, the Liberal Party broke Senate convention regarding the replacement of senators. </para>
        <para>In 1975 we get now the second version of the stand and deliver argument. The Liberal Party says: 'Stand and deliver us an election because the gallup polls seem to suggest that we might win it. Stand and deliver us an election or the Budget will be refused '. These are the realities of the Liberal Party as distinct from its principles which are so often espoused as being the philosophy of the Party. The key to all this is that still the Liberal Party, the much vaunted Liberal Party, is really the handmaiden of the National Country Party. The Liberal Party began its campaign in support of its rejection or delay of the Budget with a big rally at the Myer music bowl in Melbourne. There was a list of prominent Liberal Party speakers to address that rally. At the bottom of that list there appeared these words: Guest <inline font-weight="bold">speaker, Mr Doug</inline> Anthony'. Guest  speaker,  if you please- the man who devised it all in 1974, who supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> with his breaking of the convention regarding the replacement of a senator. </para>

            <para>-The ghost at Banquo's feast, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland so eloquently puts it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> is the man who again in 1975 provoked this course upon which the Liberal Party has allowed itself to embark. He is the man who is desperately concerned about one particular issue, that is, that the electorates in the House of Representatives might be redistributed in accordance with the will of the Joint Sitting of this Parliament and with the recommendations of the electoral commissioners. That is his basic concern. He is concerned about that for one very simple reason, which is that electorates which have been described by every independent commentator as fair should be the basis for the elections of this Parliament. He is concerned about the decline which the National Country Party would suffer if the votes of citizens in the cities of Australia were worth the same as the votes of citizens in certain country electorates. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> has yielded to those pressures, and this is the reality of the Liberal Party at the moment. In May 1973 these words appeared in an article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age:</inline></para>

        <para class="block">Those are the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser. How true the words are. But is it the same man talking? Will the real <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> please stand up? Is the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> who said that, the man who sought desperately for reprehensible circumstances and then decided to allow himself to be pushed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> and his colleagues into this delay of the Budget? Is that the real <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser?</inline> That is what the people of Australia want to know. Which is the real one? Is it the one who replaced <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> because he was a man of principle and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> was not? Is it the man who said that the House or Representatives was the place where the party with a majority should be allowed to continue in government? Or is it the man who in the last few weeks has sought every expedient to justify the actions which he has taken as distinct from those high sounding principles? What does he mean when he says: 'We want a style and manner of government that wins respect. '? Is the Senate winning respect by its present conduct? Is the Senate winning respect by debating the situation of the potato industry when the Australian Budget is being delayed? Is the Senate winning respect by the sort of comments that have been made here today by various speakers on the Opposition side as to how many lawyers everybody has endorsing their particular position? Is that a winning of respect? Is that the sort of thing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> was talking about. </para>
        <para>He went on to say: 'We cannot rely on our opponents making errors. We must demonstrate by better arguments and by better behaviour that we have earned the right to govern. If we do not do those things we will be unlikely to achieve it. ' I could not agree more with him, and there are many people in the Liberal Party who are beginning to think that they could not agree more with what he said in 1973. But this is the tragic situation with which the Senate is now confronted because of this action which has been taken. It is no longer a question of the sort of issues which were properly debated in this chamber a few months ago relating to economic management and so on. Those issues have gone. They have gone because the Opposition has laid down new issues; not better policies, not better arguments and not better behaviour, but a different set of issues which it hopes will do something to justify its action which, as I said before, is quite unprecedented. </para>

Hope springs eternal that the Governor-General has, in addition to his other virtues, the virtue of charity and will provide a face-saving solution for the good of the country.

        <para>I want to contrast the proposition which the <inline font-style="italic">National Times</inline> puts and the course which the Liberal Party has pursued with the words of the Leader of the Opposition himself. The <inline font-style="italic">National Times</inline> puts the alternative of digging up more dirt on the Government over the loans affairs and/or the ACTU-Solo deal and suggests that attempts are being made very vigorously to do so. We all know that it is taking place. The alternative put forward by the Leader of the Liberal Party is to try to cultivate a style of government that receives the respect of the Australian people, commands their attention and gives the Liberal Party the right to govern. As I have said before, many Liberals share that view put by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser.</inline> But the contrast is between the mouthings of principle and the actual behaviour of the Opposition. The behaviour of the Opposition is zeroed in, if I can use that expression, exclusively on the suggestion made to it by the <inline font-style="italic">National Times</inline> to dig up more dirt on the Government on the loans affair and/or the ACTU-Solo deal. Then this bonus came out of the blue sky yesterday when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> announced that he had disclosed details of the Budget to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke.</inline></para>

Of course, all the speeches from Opposition senators that we have heard in this debate amount to one thing. They do not like the Government. None of the Opposition speakers likes the Government. Surprise, surprise! I did not come here 18 months ago really thinking that they would. They have carried on for a fortnight now saying that the Budget has to be delayed because they do not like the Government. I subscribe very realistically to the view that that will probably continue to be the case. What I am trying to say in the course of my remarks tonight is that they will have to get used to that position because it will continue to be the case for a very long time. </para>

        <para>Let us examine the conduct of members of the Liberal Party. It was referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> the other day as the party which was impressed by money, staff, nice offices and things of that kind and as being led into this course of conduct by this sort of thing. The Liberal Party machine has reared its head and displayed its true quality. </para>
        <para class="block">It has displayed its political acumen, if I can put it that way, by those brilliant advertisements we saw in the newspapers day after day. I think that the advertisements stated, 'We had to do it' or We must do it'. We heard that cry of desperation from a man of principle who suddenly had to descend into the cave of the troglodytes, walk across hot coals or whatever might be necessary in order to try to win electoral power. So the Opposition members continue day after day to beat their breasts, saying that they do not like us. That is not a reprehensible circumstance in itself. That condition came about on 2 December 1 972 when the new criterion of reprehensible circumstances had not been invented in Australian constitutional law. </para>

            <para>-Of course, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland points out, the very fact of the Labor Party's winning office was itself a reprehensible circumstances from which the Opposition has never recovered. I say this to Opposition members: The real task that they have is not to persuade themselves in their righteous indignation and dislike of this Government that a whole set of reprehensible circumstances exists. The real task is to persuade the Australian people of that as a political exercise, quite apart from the constitutional problems which you have, quite apart from questions of political morality and quite apart from departure from the fine sounding statements which their new Leader of principle has espoused over the last few months and from which he has so consistently departed in practice. These are the real problems which the Opposition has in a political sense. What we are concerned about is to get the Budget back before the Senate and to get it passed in order that the things that the Opposition expressed concern about in months gone by- inflation, unemployment, lack of business confidence, education- could be proceeded with as a matter of the normal processes of Australian government. If that course had been followed the whole situation politically might be a little different, both for the Liberal Party and for Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I seek leave to continue my remarks. </para>
