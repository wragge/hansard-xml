          <para>- I wish to make a personal explanation relating to misrepresentation by the media. Last night the media reported that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> had forwarded to me some correspondence involving a proposed appearance before the Senate by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> and the report went on to say that I was considering the matter. I wish to advise the Senate that I received no correspondence from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> last night. At 9 a.m. today my secretary discovered on the table a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> enclosing a letter from a Sydney solicitor with reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and his proposed appearance before the Senate. My secretary immediately handed the letter to me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> &#39;s letter indicated that he had also sent copies of the solicitor&#39;s letter to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, the Leader of the National Country Party in the Senate, the Leader of the Liberal Movement and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunton.</inline> I do not know who made the statement that I had received the correspondence last night and was considering it, but I regard it as a serious matter. I strongly object to media publicity involving the  President  in this way, and I hope that I can expect from those concerned a withdrawal and an apology. </para>

Is it true that the evidence upon which he was convicted related wholly to alleged activities in Australia? Is it also true that there is absolutely no evidence available to authorities in Australia, including the Department of Foreign Affairs, of any association by this man with any Croatian nationalist group of any description whatever? Is not the action of the Yugoslav Government an apparent denial of human rights and a ruthless intimidation of a Yugoslav national minority by a calculated injustice to an Australian citizen?

            <para>-Perhaps if I were to give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> the facts he could then judge whether his allegations are correct. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline> was charged under Article 1 1 7, paragraph (2) of the Criminal Code with being a member of an illegal organisation, the HRB- that is, the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood- swearing an oath of membership, taking an illegal name and membership number as directed by the HRB, remaining a member after the amnesty law of 23 November 1973, being a current financial member, and being trained for terrorist activities. Razor pleaded guilty as charged and was found guilty as charged. The  President  rejected the defence citation of paragraph (4) of Article 1 1 7 on grounds that Razor remained a member of the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood after 23 November 1973 and continued to work for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline> was sentenced to 3 years&#39; strict imprisonment at Split on 24 October after conviction under Article 1 17 (2) of the Yugoslav Criminal Code which prescribes the penalty for membership of organisations directed against the Yugoslav State. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor,</inline> as I said, pleaded guilty to this charge. At the request of the prosecution and defence lawyers, and at the behest of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor&#39;s</inline> own family, the trial was closed to the Press and public. Nevertheless, the Yugoslav authorities gave permission for the Consul of our embassy in Belgrade to attend the trial throughout, and he also had the opportunity to speak to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor.I</inline> believe we should welcome this step by the Yugoslav authorities. It is all the more to be welcomed when seen against the fact that although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline> had an Australian passport he chose to enter Yugoslavia as a Yugoslav national on presentation of a passport issued by that country. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nazor</inline> has informed us that he intends to appeal. </para>

            <para>- The  Chairman  of the Prices Justification Tribunal,  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Williams, has drawn the attention of my Department to that report, and I am given to understand by him that in view of recent movements in bread prices the Tribunal considered that the application made to it by the 2 major Victoria based companies should be looked at in some depth. In the circumstances the time taken for that review does not seem to be in any way unreasonable and certainly was well within the statutory limits applying in the circumstances. There are two other factors, of course, that also should be borne in mind. One is that I am given to understand that the Joint Committee on Prices should soon finish its report following its inquiry on bread. The report will be presented to the Parliament and doubtless will be the subject of debate by the Parliament. The other factor is that I am given to understand that wheat prices are expected to increase again as from 1 December, and this too could have an effect on bread prices. </para>

Was the Prime Minister aware of the Treasurer&#39;s action and did he approve? If the Prime Minister was not aware, has he reprimanded the Treasurer since the disclosure was made?

We have authorised the Ambassador to evacuate our people when he thinks fit, should this be necessary. Because of the unstable situation in the central city area, and especially in the area where our chancery is located, the Australian Embassy moved on 23 October to the Carlton Hotel which is on the far western edge of the city somewhat away from the main fighting. Ambassador <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peter</inline> Curtis is now resident at the hotel. Under present conditions the Embassy&#39;s capacity to deal with inquiries is still limited. The Ambassador&#39;s advice to Australian nationals is still that they should not go to Beirut unless their business is essential. For the time being we are confident that the Embassy can continue to carry out its functions under as secure a combination of living and working conditions as it is now possible to achieve. It remains the Australian Government&#39;s hope that some arrangements may soon be reached between the conflicting parties which will restore peace in Lebanon. </para>

            <para>-As the Minister responsible to the Government and to the Parliament for the Bureau of Statistics, I can say quite emphatically that statements made by members of the Opposition along the lines mentioned by the honourable senator are not correct. There is no truth at all in the suggestions which have been put forward by a number of spokesmen on behalf of the Opposition, that the Government in any way has tampered or interfered with the Statistician in the compilation of the consumer price index. The fact is that the Statistician completes the compilation and publication of statistical series without any reference to the Government and without any direct or indirect attempts by the Government to influence him in the course of his work. As is usual in such matters, the decision on the treatment of Medibank for the purposes of the consumer price index for the September quarter was entirely the responsibility of the Statistician and the Government had no knowledge of that treatment until the day the figures were released. I suggest that for the Leader of the Opposition to say that the consumer price index is a political fraud, for the Leader of the National Country Party to say that it is dishonest for the Government to exclude the costs of medical cover from the index and for the Opposition spokesman on Labor to say that the Government is cheating over the consumer price index figures is to do a great disservice and is an unwarranted and unjustified attack on a very competent Australian public servant. </para>

            <para>- The Australian Meat Board, which controls the flow of meat onto the American market, has indicated that the rate of shipment has got slightly ahead of schedule, but only slightly. Our market in the United States this year is about 290 000 tonnes, and until the first week in October the amount shipped was about 266 000 tonnes. Australia received a shortfall from the United States of 10 000 tonnes, that is, meat which the United States was unable to get from its other sources of supply, and that has enabled us to export the additional amount of 10 000 tonnes. That means that at the present time about 23 000 to 25 000 tonnes remain of our allocation to the United States market, and I understand that that will be completed by about the third or fourth week in November, which would place us approximately a fortnight ahead of the shipping program. It is not a serious matter, but the Americans prefer to receive the meat on the regular basis for which the schedules provide. I am quite sure that there will be no noticeable detrimental effect on our export trade to the United States as a result of this. </para>

Further, did the station advertise on 23 October details of rallies to be held by the Australian Labor Party in Sydney on that weekend and also give incorrect information about a Liberal Party rally to be held the following day? Did the commentators make a series of very specific, personally offensive remarks about the Leader of the Opposition? Were all callers required to notify the switchboard operator of who they were and of what comments they wished to make? Is the Minister aware that several Liberal supporters complained that when they told the switchboard operator they wished to comment in favour of the Liberal position they were not put through to air and were excluded from making any broadcasting comment? Is the Minister also aware that on at least one occasion when a person did manage to make some comment unfavourable to the Government that person was cut off the air in mid-sentence?

Therefore, because of my engagements, I was not listening to radio station 2 JJ and I am unaware of what transpired on that day or, indeed, on Thursday 23 October, when this Parliament was sitting and I was also otherwise engaged. Of course, the honourable senator will be aware that this Government, while it has been in office, religiously has adopted a practice of asserting the programming and political independence of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Radio station 2JJ is a part of the Australian Broadcasting Commission broadcasting network. I suggest to the honourable senator that if he has any complaints about radio station 2JJ he should raise them with the  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Professor Downing, or with the General Manager of the ABC, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duckmanton,</inline> or he might like to discuss the matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Marius</inline> Webb who just recently has been appointed a commissioner of the ABC, after being elected by the staff of the Commission and who I understand is an operator of radio station 2JJ. </para>

I think the information was not very well based and it would seem that he was relying upon the Australian Mutual Provident Society which is not the most unbiased commentator on these affairs. If he were to have read the annual report of the New Zealand Accident Compensation Commission for the year ended 3 1 March last I think he would have formed quite a different picture and would have realised that what the Australian Mutual Provident Society had to say was not based on fact. </para>

          <para>There are some differences between the accident compensation scheme in New Zealand and that which has been proposed for Australia. The New Zealand scheme is paid for by a 1 per cent levy on employers. It is in fact a funded scheme which brings with it a number of the problems which the insurance companies who are engaging in workers compensation and third party insurance are at present facing in Australia in having to provide for future payments which may be at greatly inflated rates on premiums which are paid today. Nonetheless the annual report of the Accident Compensation Commission states that the Commission sees no grounds for any immediate change in the rate of levies charged. Nonetheless despite the difficulties which there are in inflation- there is inflation in New Zealand- the financing which has been received from the 1 per cent levy on employers has proved adequate for the quite substantial scheme of accident compensation in New Zealand. Contrary to something else which was said by the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph,</inline> namely, that the estimates in New Zealand had proved to be awry and that they had underestimated the - </para>

              <para>-Just a sense of restraint which is not shown in the honourable senator&#39;s questions. I am sorry that the Opposition does not want to hear about this matter because the New Zealand accident compensation scheme is relevant. Prior estimates for the first 12 months of the accident compensation scheme in New Zealand were put at between $25m and $30m. In fact, what was paid out by the New Zealand Accident Compensation Commission was $32.8m. This is less than the maximum estimate which was made by the New Zealand Accident Compensation Commission and by the New Zealand Government. The Australian Government constantly watches the operations of the Accident Compensation Commission in New Zealand. In fact, the success of the New Zealand accident compensation scheme was one of the things that encouraged us in pursuing our objectives for a national compensation scheme in Australia, despite the misleading statements made by the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline> on information provided by the Australian Mutual Provident Society. </para>

            <para>- It is very easy for people to make slanderous statements about public servants. Apparently they identify public servants with this Government and believe that by slandering them they can in some way slander the Government. I am surprised that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chipp</inline> is aware of such incidents as these involving public servants to whom he has referred as crude, rude people in the Department of Social Security, as shadow spokesman on social security matters he did not take the matter up with me and draw my attention to these instances. I am still waiting to hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chipp</inline> about any specific instance. I have not heard of any instance from him at all. In fact, it is obvious to anyone who has any knowledge of the operations of the Department of Social Security and of the very difficult field of the payment of unemployment benefits, sickness benefits and age pensions, that the public servants are working under great difficulties. They are carrying out their duties admirably. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is every indication that public servants in the Department will continue to work, even without pay, if the Opposition denies them their salaries as a result of the actions which it is taking in the Senate. I think it is worth while noting a report by W. D. Scott and Company Pty Ltd, which is certainly not a Labor front organisation, in its review of the Department of Social Security benefits administration in New South Wales and Victoria. The report stated: </para>

            <para>Generally speaking we were very impressed by both the quality and job motivations of the staff. They were serious minded career public servants very much aware of their responsibilities to the public and prepared to work very hard. They were not inclined to look for overt recognition or thanks and they were articulate in analysing their functions and responsibilities. </para>

On Friday night I received a telephone call from my Department and was informed that attorneys in New York had made an inquiry as to whether a visa would be available for a person named Khemlani to visit Australia. I, with the concurrence of the Prime Minister, said that a visa would be available and it was made clear to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> that a visa would be required. On previous occasions <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> has come here without a visa and he has been told on the last two or three occasions that in future he would be required to produce a visa. He was told this the last time he visited here and of course it was made clear also to his attorneys in New York. </para>

              <para>-My knowledge does not go back that far, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. After</inline> all, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani&#39;s</inline> position has changed rapidly, has it not? He has become a darling of those who once said that he was a sleazy character and this has become clear, as witnessed by the events of yesterday because it was not a car of ours which met him at the airport. Despite this warning, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> arrived at Sydney airport yesterday without a visa. The Government did not want to stand in the way of any plans which the Opposition may have had for him. We did not want to whisk him out of the country. We wanted every opportunity to be given to the Opposition to see whether he carried anything in his bags which would help to get the Opposition off the hook, so I gave directions that he was to be given the usual transit facilities, that is, he could stay here for another 72 hours. He is obviously taking the fullest advantage of this courtesy which was extended to him by the Australian Government and is using his time to the best advantage. It remains to be seen whether there is any advantage to the Opposition in his stay. </para>

            <para>- I welcome any questions directed to the role of the Government with relation to union demands and suggest that our record in this respect will stand up to anything that we could expect from a Minister for Labor from the other side of the House. We are not, of course, in any position to forbid the unions from suggesting that a 2.9 per cent increase or any other figure should be taken into account as the correct indexation figure in the hearing commencing before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission today, any more than we can forbid an employers federation from claiming that nothing should be passed on. The submission that will be put on behalf of the Australian Government at the present hearing is that the figure of 0.8 per cent, which was the figure for the CPI increase that was released recently by the Statistician, should be added by way of indexation. </para>

Can the Minister confirm last Friday&#39;s newspaper report that public servants have been required to work overtime recently in order to draw up, as a matter of urgency, a list of Government achievements, apparently in anticipation of a federal election? Would the Minister confirm that, if the information was required merely for the Prime Minister&#39;s end of year statement to the Parliament, overtime would not be necessary for that job at this time of the year? Can the Minister confirm that some departments have been required to draw up the information on a federal electorate basis rather than a regional or national basis, thus providing the details at high public expense for an Australian Labor Party campaign in each electorate? How does the Government justify the authorising of overtime on this nonessential task at the same time as it is threatening to withdraw other clearly necessary public services on the basis of a lack of money? </para>

            <para>-The report, which appeared in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Mail</inline> over the weekend and which I have been told appeared in one other newspaper, was apparently taken from the annual report of the Weapons Research Establishment. For many years remotely piloted vehicles have been used for a variety of purposes, including weapons and gunnery trials. For example, the Jindivik and the Purana target aircraft are well known examples of work in Australia in the field and have been, of course, an accomplishment of the WRE. Until recently those vehicles have been of a moderate size in order to carry the necessary guidance instrumentation and control systems and, as a result, have been fairly expensive. With the development of miniature components the equipment has been developed to the stage where it can be carried for longer periods in small vehicles. The one that was mentioned in the newspaper report was a model aircraft. Australia has always had a very active program in research developments of this sort. Researches and studies are presently being carried out by the Navy and by a defence group. As a result there will be an evaluation of the use to which Australia might put this vehicle for its own purposes. </para>

I think it is important for Aboriginal culture that these relics be saved. The article suggested that they were sacred relics which should be shown only to initiated males of the tribe. Therefore, the fact that someone has them would seem to indicate a breach of the cultural requirements of the Aboriginal community. I shall take up the matter with the Minister to see whether the nature of the articles is such that he should take appropriate action. </para>

            <para>- For the last month tests have been conducted on a new maritime telex service which will enable ships at sea to place direct telex calls to subscribers anywhere in Australia or, through the Overseas Telecommunication Commission&#39;s international communication network, to almost anywhere in the world. Some hundreds of ships around the world are equipped to use the system. It will start on 1 November. Australian and overseas telex users will also be able to place calls to suitably equipped ships in contact with OTC&#39;s Sydney radio station. The tests have been successful. We think the service will be welcomed. I am told that in the present circumstances a large container consortium already proposes to use the system and that the early response proves that the advance is necessary in the world-wide application of new techniques. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Police and Customs. I read recently that a meeting of the Australian and State Ministers for Police had agreed to develop services for common use by police forces. Is there any connection between this report and previous reports of plans to set up a police computer network throughout Australia? </para>

            <para>-Before the commencement of the present session of the Parliament the State Ministers of Police met me in Canberra. Among the matters discussed was the making available of central facilities to police services throughout Australia. The Australian Government offered to establish computer terminals in each State in the Department of Police and Customs so that the police headquarters of each State could be connected to the central facility and be able to use the data available at that facility. As a result of the meeting of the police Ministers a working party was set up for the purpose of analysing the range of police data that could be stored in a central place and made available for the use of police throughout Australia. The computer service will have to take into consideration the report of the Law Reform Commission to ensure that the data which is stored does not contravene our laws on human rights or civil liberties. The establishment of such a central service will not only result in a great financial saving but also we believe it will make available greater areas of advanced police science and technology to forces which at present do not have those facilities. </para>

            <para>-Has the Special Minister of State been able to ascertain from the Australian Statistician whether, in calculating the consumer price index for the September quarter, he changed either the weighting of medical and hospital services in the index or the method of pricing those services? In view of the general public interest in the September quarter consumer price index figures, particularly as regards the treatment of Medibank and the apparent misrepresentation of the index in a number of quarters, will the Minister consider asking the Statistician to prepare a supplementary paper to assist the users of these figures? </para>

            <para>- In response to a question that was directed to me I mentioned earlier that the responsibility for the compilation of the consumer price index is that of the Statistician. When I discussed the matter with the Statistician he advised me that the weights of hospital and medical items in the index are unchanged from those used in the June quarter. As stated in the September quarter 1975 consumer price index bulletin, the method of pricing of these services remains unchanged. The Statistician advises me that these items have always been priced in the index net of Commonwealth reimbursements. Last quarter the price of these items was net of Commonwealth benefits; this quarter they are net of Medibank benefits. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As regards the second aspect of the honourable senator&#39;s question, I am aware that there has been much comment in the Press and elsewhere on the consumer price index as presented by the Statistician. Although I believe that the Statistician &#39;s bulletin was entirely clear and quite to the point, I nonetheless concede that a useful purpose might be served if the Statistician circulated supplementary information on the matter. I discussed this matter with the Statistician yesterday and I am given to understand by him that the Australian Bureau of Statistics itself had already considered the preparation of such a paper. The Bureau is now in the course of preparing a supplementary paper for circulation to interested users. I can advise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown,</inline> who has shown quite some interest in this matter, that I understand that the Statistician hopes to have this supplementary paper available today. </para>

I refer to the comment that he has made in the Senate this day that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> of the Australian Council of Trade Unions was advised of Budget details prior to their announcement in the Parliament. I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Were any other members of his Party or of the public generally advised of the details of the Budget prior to its announcement in the Parliament? Does it appear to the Leader of the Government in the Senate that it is a breaking of a very real convention when a director of a retailing establishment- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> is a director of the ACTU store in Melbourne and a director of ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd- is advised in advance of the details of the Budget? Does it appear that it may be an embarrassment to both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and the Government for this type of convention to be established? In line with the Government&#39;s pronouncement of a desire for open Government and in view of the fact that the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of 21 October stated, according to a former member of the Australian Labor Party, that he had the Hayden Budget leak some weeks before the Budget was presented, will the Leader of the Government in the Senate lay before the Senate, in pursuit of open Government, the details of who was alerted to the Budget and on what dates or at what hour they were alerted? </para>

            <para>- I was not aware that these approaches had been made. I accept that they have been; I would not be surprised if they had been made. It would be in the normal course of the Department&#39;s business. The Department is involved very substantially in the field of workers compensation, and whatever may be the fate of any proposed national compensation scheme, there is already a very substantial system of compensation in the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act, which is administered by the Department of Repatriation and Compensation, and in the Seamen&#39;s Compensation Act. I assume that if the officers of the Department were seeking any advice it was so that they could obtain information which might help them to administer better the workers compensation activities in which they are involved. No insurance companies are under any obligation to provide this information, and if the information is felt by the companies to be confidential then they are under no obligation to provide it to the Department. There is a quite free exchange of information between my Department and insurance companies on a number of matters. With regard to compensation for the Darwin cyclone, for example, there was quite a lot of exchange from one to the other about how that matter was progressing, and I assume that the same procedure is being adopted here. There is nothing sinister in it, and if the insurance companies do not wish to provide the information they do not have to. </para>

              <para>- I rise on a point of order. Last week I raised the point of order that the Senate ought not to proceed with the urgency motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> on the basis that a royal commission was still inquiring into matters concerned with the oil industry, matters with which this urgency motion is associated. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> you will recall that that point of order was raised by me and as yet I have not had an answer to it. Admittedly, we are now in a new situation and I am raising the point of order again. I believe that the point of order is even more pertinent now because the Royal Commission on Petroleum is meeting today. I cannot see how we can enter into a debate of this sort at this moment, while the Royal Commission is hearing evidence, especially when I suspect, based on statements which have been made by members of the Opposition in the past, that the Commission will come under adverse comment. Therefore, I again raise the point of order that it is not advisable for the Senate to debate a matter which at this very moment is being heard before the Royal Commission in Melbourne. For that reason I am raising with added emphasis the point of order that I raised last week. </para>

As I understand the position, the subject matter of the motion which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> desires to move is not the same as the subject matter before the Royal Commission on Petroleum this day. The general inquiry is made before the Royal Commission. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> letter to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> deals with the matter in some particularity. On the general question, I submit that whether there is any substance in the point of order will be decided ultimately by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> asking yourself the question: Is parliamentary debate likely to give rise to any real or substantial danger of prejudice to the proceedings before the Royal Commission? If not- I submit that you should rule that it is not- parliamentary debate should not be restrained. </para>

          <para>I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> raised this point last week. He has raised it again this week. Whilst not in any way attempting to take away or to deny the right of an individual senator to raise any matter in the Senate chamber- I say this with the utmost respect for my friend, if not, colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges-</inline> I would have imagined that this would have been a point which either the Minister of Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> or the Special Minister of State <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland),</inline> who has within his jurisdiction the oversight of royal commissions, would have raised. I do not know that oversight&#39; is the right word to use in regard to royal commissions, but they come within his Department. I submit on behalf of the Opposition that this matter does not fall within the normal rules. There are no criminal or civil proceedings pending concerning this matter, so far as anybody in the Senate is aware. In any event, a royal commission is not a court. It is purely an inquiry. It is a commission issued by the Crown to a person, not always necessarily a judge or even a lawyer, to inquire into certain matters. It is well known that a royal commission only brings in findings and recommendations. It has no basic power within itself, apart from the normal powers on controlling its own proceedings. For those reasons, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I submit that you should rule that this matter can proceed. </para>

I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges&#39;</inline> silence is an indication that no such thing has occurred. It is a matter in which, if proceedings of a criminal nature had been raised and if a royal commission went ahead, perhaps it would be prejudiced. That is the opposite situation. But here there are no suggestions that proceedings have been issued or are contemplated and in fact the position remains that if the point of order were upheld then the right of the Senate to inquire into matters that are under constant public discussion and which follow from a report which has long since been issued would be prejudiced. Such a rule would prejudice the right of the Senate to discuss matters of importance in the community. I do urge you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> to refuse to uphold the point of order. </para>

          <para class="block">The need for a further inquiry into the matters which have come to light since the report of the royal commission of inquiry into the ACTU-Solo matter is imperative. This motion of urgency provides the vehicle by which some of these matters can be aired and the <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case for the further inquiry can be established. Allegations have been made in this chamber during the lifetime of this Government concerning the way in which it uses government power to favour its friends and supporters. I do not elaborate but we have seen promises not to enforce the law and otherwise to give benefits in return for substantial electoral donations. We have seen the rewarding of friends and supporters and, one might say, the curious tax benefits which come to donors to the Australian Labor Party&#39;s huge building complex in Canberra. It is a Government in which patronage and corruption have been rife and the allegations have been documented. But these earlier activities pale into insignificance in the light of what the report of the Royal Commission on Petroleum reveals concerning the ACTU-Solo affair. Persons who deal with the Government and who deal with others in the market on the basis of government policy have been required to adhere to that policy. Many people have seen gains and benefits but they have been denied those gains and benefits because government policy prevented them from being realised. But the Australian Council of Trade Unions joined with a group of commercial interests known as the &#39;Solo interests&#39; and have been able to secure what other companies have been denied. Why? What were the benefits? What were the advantages which have come to ACTU-Solo? Why has the Government given these advantages? How was it that the company of which the  President  of the ACTU is a director- he is also the  President  of the Australian Labor Party- was able to make a deal with the Minister who has since been discredited and who has resigned? These are facts upon which the public is entitled to more information than has been given. The report indicates, by its terms, a pattern of deceit and misrepresentation for which it holds the directors of ACTU-Solo responsible. When taken with the Minister&#39;s statements in the Parliament there is the strongest suspicion of a secret deal by the Government to help the ACTU and the  President  of the Australian Labor Party, who is also the  President  of the ACTU, in the commercial deals in which he is involving himself and the ACTU. This is being done by fraud, concealment and lies. </para>
          <para>There is strong evidence of a massive cover-up by the Government, by the directors of ACTUSolo and by others, the full proportions of which have not yet been revealed. Serious questions about these matters have been raised inside and outside the Parliament but they have not been answered. It has been requested that documents be produced in this chamber and tabled. They have not been produced. No response has been given as to why they have not been produced and tabled. One of the significant figures in the whole story, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> has had the finger of involvement clearly laid upon him. He has declined to give evidence to the commission or to answer questions in public about the matter. He has intimidated prospective questioners and commentators, who have asked about his role, by outspoken threats of defamation action. On this issue he has woven around himself an unusual texture of silence of such a character that it is only the free speech which this Parliament affords which will expose to the public the facts which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> seems to want to conceal and, equally and fairly, the exposure of these facts will provide material upon which, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> chooses, he can give his explanations. </para>
          <para>Very briefly I recall the findings of this commission. It found that there was a purchase of crude oil by ACTU-Solo from Allied Petrochemicals Pty Ltd at $5 per barrel. The commission found that the price of $5 per barrel was well in excess of the approved price of $2. 10 per barrel. The commission found that ACTUSolo split this purchase price or split the consideration into 2 agreements. The first agreement provided that the purchase price was $2.10 per barrel and the second, undisclosed, hidden agreement contained the consideration for the balance of the purchase price. The commission found that only the first agreement was presented to the Minister. The second agreement was regarded as a matter not for government  and it was not disclosed to the Government. It is relevant to read what the commission said on this aspect. The commission asked: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Why were 2 documents prepared when the transaction could quite simply have been set forth in one document; </para>
            <para>Why does the second document freely refer to the first document while the first document, the one produced to the Minister, never refers to the second; </para>
            <para>Why was the purchase price apportioned in this extraordinary way; </para>
            <para>For what conceivable purpose were the documents procured in this form if it was not to procure a document which appeared to stand alone as a completed contract to purchase for $2. 10 per barrel? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The answers to those questions were not given to the commission. The answers to those questions have not been given to the Parliament. The answers to those questions have not been given to the public. The answers ought to be given and further inquiries should reveal them. The ultimate result, as the commission found, was that there were misrepresentations made which deceived the Minister as to the price being paid. As the Commission found, and I use its own language, &#39;all the directors of ACTU-Solo bear responsibility for&#39;- I underline these next words- &#39;the deliberate deception of a Minister of the Australian Government&#39;. There were other incidental findings. APC, an American company and normally the scourge of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> the ACTU and the Australian Labor Party, secured a windfall profit of about <inline font-style="italic">$VAm.</inline> ACTU-Solo secured its refined motor spirit as a result of this deal at some 5c a gallon cheaper and, as a result of a $2 a barrel levy which the Budget imposed, it received it approximately 11c to 12c cheaper and, as the Commission found, it would be inequitable and unjust to companies which have abided by Government policy for ACTU-Solo as a result of its misrepresentation and deceit to acquire any right to further allocation. </para>
          <para>In all this the substantial finding which is incapable of contradiction was that there was an arrangement which contravened the Government&#39;s policy. No one can dispute that. It is as plain as can be. When ACTU-Solo agreed to purchase at $5 a barrel this was a price in excess of the Government&#39;s approved price. As I have stated, governments had previously refused to approve any purchase price which was in excess of its approved price. Other prospective buyers had been prepared to pay the same or more than ACTU-Solo paid but their agreements were blocked. The only one which got through was the ACTU-Solo agreement in circumstances which the Commission said were arrived at by deliberate deception. The Government ought to have been concerned and still ought to be concerned with the report as devastating in its condemnation as this report, but so far it has treated the report as too hot to handle and too dangerous to debate. It has not presented the material for debate in this Parliament. It has declined to answer substantive questions. There has been no prosecution for a breach of provisions of the Crimes Act and apparently there is to be no prosecution. The Minister for Manufacturing Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lionel</inline> Bowen, has said that no further allocation will be granted to ACTU-Solo. Subsequently, of course, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> has indicated that provided ACTUSolo acts within the law, any proposition it puts up will be considered. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> is publicly stating that he is hopeful, that he is anticipating, that he expects that notwithstanding the Commission&#39;s findings he will still get his allocation of crude oil. </para>
          <para>There are implications of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter&#39;s</inline> statement which have not been explained or justified. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> has said to the Commission and subsequently that the Minister was not deceived and that he, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter,</inline> as Secretary of the ACTU and a director of ACTU-Solo had gained the impression from discussions he held with the Minister earlier in May that the second agreement was something which the Government did not want to see and that he, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter,</inline> was the scapegoat and that the Commission&#39;s report was incorrect and unfair. We have not had any explanation from the Government or the Minister in response to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> said. The Commission found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter&#39;s</inline> statements were false and, following that, 2 questions arise: First, were they false by arrangement with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor;</inline> second, were they false with the knowledge of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke?</inline> The Opposition, on the material available to it, does not dispute the Commission&#39;s findings. We take them as basic and build on them and use the additional material which was not available to the Commission and which the Commission did not have on which to make its findings. </para>
          <para>One of those matters is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor&#39;s</inline> credibility. He was at all times the relevant Minister for Minerals and Energy. The Commission presumed him to be honest and to have been deceived. He is now shown to be a man who has either lied to the Parliament or engaged in a pattern of misrepresentation and concealment which may be said to have amounted to the same thing. He is now no longer the Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> had knowledge of many matters which ought to have put him on his guard. I shall not reiterate matters which I have already related to the Senate and which will be followed up by succeeding speakers. </para>
          <para>Secondly, we have had subsequently the statement of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse,</inline> who has been a witness before this Commission, who has appeared to argue the case before the Commission, who has cross-examined witnesses and who was responsible because of what he told the Commission for the facts of this ACTU-Solo dealing coming before the Commission. He has written to the Commission, setting out material upon which he urges that there be a further inquiry and, in response to that request, he has received an acknowledgment. He has had no indication that the Commission intends to proceed of its own initiative any further. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> also made a statement last week to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> The article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> was headed: &#39;I had Hayden Budget leak- Former ALP man &#39;.

              <para>-The Woodhouse disclosures indicate that a $2 a barrel levy was known to him before the Budget, that the plan was conceived and material steps were taken in May 1975, that the option was taken in consequence of the knowledge that approval would be received for the transaction, that an arrangement was made to mislead the Commission and that directors of ACTU-Solo had a personal interest in the deal. </para>

          <para>I have indicated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> has been actively concerned in this Commission. He is not a millionaire, as the Federal Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> wrongly has alleged. The Treasurer&#39;s assertions were calculated, I believe, to discredit <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> for fear of what he would say. I have been assured by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> that he is not a wealthy, self interested person- he is a service station proprietor, living in a humble weatherboard house in Melbourne- and that the allegations of the Treasurer are completely unfounded. He has made these allegations in a statutory declaration. He wants to amplify the allegations in evidence. I cannot say that what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> has alleged must be true or is true, but he is entitled in the light of the allegations he has made, to have them put before a proper inquiry, to be able to make his statements on oath and to have anyone who challenges them or wants to contradict them to put his case also and to test <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> as to his credibility. That is only right and proper when allegations of this serious character are made. </para>
          <para>I have asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> for, and he has told me, the broad outline of what he would say. He claims he was told there was to be a $2 a barrel levy on the production of crude oil, which was a Budget proposal that generally came as a surprise and which doubled the price. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> knew nothing of it. But on what basis did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> on 5 August 1975- 14 days before the Budget- ask a question in the Commission which presumed that the crude was to double its price, which in fact it did as a result of the $2 a barrel levy imposed by the Budget. </para>

            <para>-If the source of the information upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> bases his story is claimed to be what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> told his fellow director, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wieland,</inline> how did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> know of a decision which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> has said in the Parliament was made, and known to only a few people on 30 July? I make no judgment. The seriousness of the accusation is beyond question. It ought to be tested. Those who would rebut it ought to have their opportunity to put their account. If on 7 May 1975, that early date, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> was able to ask questions before the Commission, as he was, pointing to a link between the ACTU and the Solo interests which would put the ACTU in an advantageous position, the question must arise as to where he got his information at that stage. If on 28 August he was able to state that the directors of ACTU-Solo would come before- the Commission and claim that there was a profit-sharing agreement between Pc and ACTU-Solo, as ultimately proved to be the case, is not this some evidence that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> had the information which he claimed to have at an early stage? These are matters warranting inquiry. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The position of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> no less warrants inquiry. In paragraph 15.4 of the report of the Commission these words appear: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission finds that the directors of ACTU-Solo, other than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> initiated and carried through a course of conduct designed to mislead and deceive the Minister for Minerals and Energy. As to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> the Commission makes no finding. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">One needs to look at paragraph 1 5.2 of the report to find out why the Commission made that exception. That paragraph states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Senior Counsel Assisting . . . proposed to submit that ACTU-Solo through its directors initiated and carried out successfully to its conclusion a course of conduct designed to deceive the Australian Government. Senior Counsel Assisting then made it plain that since these submissions carried serious implications for the persons concerned, the Commission expressly invited anybody who might be encompassed by such findings to appear before the Commission and either dissociate himself from the activities under review or offer any explanation he might have as to those activities. If such persons chose to remain silent they could only expect the ordinary and natural consequences. Neither of the other directors of ACTU-Solo, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> J. L. Hawke or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> C. White ford,  gave evidence before the Commission. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whiteford</inline>has since resigned as a director, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> continues as a director. It is transparent that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> was personally involved in this whole deal. He did not leave Australia until early June 1975. He was party to the decisions taken before he left. A substantial degree of complicity in the design to circumvent the Government&#39;s oil policy is demonstrable. No amount of bluster and threat of defamation actions can conceal the obvious. </para>
          <para>Consider in the first place his position: He is President of the Australian Labor Party; President of the ACTU; a highly placed and favourably placed individual; a trade union official committed to involving the ACTU in business enterprises- in retail selling, travel, insurance and other activities; a person who in the past has used industrial muscle or trade union power to advantage the profitability of those ventures and as I have said in this place previously, a true twentieth century robber baron in the style of the commercial and industrial musclemen of nineteenth century United States of America. Morever, he is a man in a position to assert and insist that the ALP government should assist the union movement, just as he has indicated recently that he is prepared to use the union movement to assist an ALP government. </para>
          <para>But consider the facts, in addition to his position. He knew the facts of the option arrangement under which the $5 per barrel purchase price was arranged, and that is demonstrable. The commission has demonstrated that there was an option to purchase the crude oil, which was given to Solo Discount Petroleum Pty Ltd. In the negotiations with Pc which followed, at all times that company acted as agent for the company which is now known as ACTU-Solo Enterprises. The option agreement was dated 16 May 1975, and by it Pc granted to Solo Discount Petroleum Pty Ltd an option for a fee of $100 to purchase the parcel of crude at $5 per barrel. Pc twice extended the option, first by letter on 20 May and then by letter dated 21 May. It was on 22 May, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter,</inline> that the option was exercised on behalf of ACTU-Solo. The crucial dates when the option was extended and when the option was exercised were the dates of the ACTU Executive meeting held in Perth and presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke.</inline> It is inconceivable that the ACTU Executive did not give the go-ahead to exercise the option. It is equally inconceivable that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> did not know the terms of that option. It is completely inconceivable that the ACTU Executive, which has subsequently unanimously backed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter,</inline> did not know what it was going into. The words used by the commission in its findings are relevant: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The terms of the option are plain. When it exercised the option the grantee agreed to purchase the crude at $5 per barrel. This price is well above the Government approved price of $2. 10. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In other words, the ACTU, when it agreed to purchase the crude, knew it was buying at well above the Government approved price. Consider <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> &#39;s conduct. As early as 6 May, a fortnight before this particular transaction was consummated, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> was talking to the Press. As the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> said, he revealed ACTU plans to market cut price petrol. The Advertiser went on to say: </para>

            <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">President (Mr Hawke)</inline> said last night he would recommend forming the company to the ACTU Executive meeting in Perth next week. The company, to be called ACTU-Solo Enterprises, would be a joint venture with leading independent cut-price service station owners, lt is expected to be operating within three months . . . </para>

          <para class="block">According to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the same date <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> said that he, Bob Hawke, would be putting a positive recommendation to the Executive and that the new company would use industrial muscle to ensure petrol supplies are maintained. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">So he was making some statements about what was happening. The significant thing is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> did not say. He failed to say that an option had been exercised under which at that time, as he must have known, ACTU-Solo was buying from Pc at $5 a barrel- in excess of the Government price. Why did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> not make mention of that fact? I suggest that the clear conclusion anyone would draw is that if he did make mention of it it might lead to some awkward questions being asked. Indeed, the knowledge of the sale of crude oil seems to have been kept secret or to have been disclosed to few people until the remarkable revelation came before the Royal Commission on 29 August. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Leonard</inline> of Ampol knew of it, because he made some reference to the possibility, if one can read the Press statements, on 29 May. A journalist who reported what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Leonard</inline> said did not take up the matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Murray,</inline> who writes in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> constantly on this ACTU venture, apparently did not know of it. But what has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> done? He has said that he was not involved. He is reported as saying in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 4 September the following: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I understand it has already been made clear in the Royal Commission and in Federal Parliament that I was not involved in any way in the negotiations. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is a most ambivalent statement. It was not made clear either in the Parliament or in the Commission, as he alleged, nor is it clear in fact. His own Press statements reveal his knowledge. His position would necessarily involve him. His silence on crucial facts suggests knowledge of the public deception. His failure to give evidence before the Royal Commission stands out. There is a clear need for a further investigation. </para>
          <para>The Senate has before it reasoned argument as to the probable involvement of the former Minister for Minerals and Energy in the original arrangement. The former Minister has remained silent. The Senate has before it, as the Commission did, unexplained events concerning a consideration of $5 a barrel being split into 2 agreements. The Senate has before it the Commission&#39;s placing of blame on all directors of ACTU-Solo, and the strong statement, moreover, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> was not the architect of the scheme. We are not told who was. The Senate has the unerring pointers to the involvement of the crucial stages of the  President  of the Australian Labor Party and the ACTU, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> yet he has reiterated denials of involvement. Nevertheless, there is his failure to give evidence. </para>
          <para>There ought to be an inquiry. What could an inquiry ascertain? The directors of Pc and its officers who were connected with the transaction could give their story; they have not done so. The solicitors who drew up the agreements and who could explain the provision that it was the purchaser, ACTU-Solo, which requested the splitting of the consideration, could give evidence. The ACTU research team and, in particular, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kelty,</inline> could give evidence. The officials of the Commonwealth Bank, who must have been given full information to advance ACTU-Solo the purchase price of almost $2m, could give evidence. Finally, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor, Mr Hayden</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> could give evidence. The need for this inquiry is self evident. It would be a disgrace to this country if the Senate did not pursue this matter. </para>

But he is determined, of course that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> &#39;s name be denigrated in some way.

          <para>The point I want to emphasise is that the Commission brought down a report based on the evidence that was put before it. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> correctly pointed out, an invitation was issued by the Commission- in fact a warning was issued by the Commission- at paragraph 1 5.2 on page 20 of the report, about the need for persons who felt that they may have been involved as a result of this inquiry to present themselves to the Commission so that their views could be considered. I want to repeat that paragraph, which states: </para>

            <para>Senior Counsel Assisting then made it plain that since these submissions carried serious implications for the persons concerned, the Commission expressly invited anybody who might be encompassed by such findings to appear before the Commission and either disassociated himself from the activities under review or offer any explanation he might have as to those activities. If such persons chose to remain silent they could only expect the ordinary and natural consequences. Neither of the other directors of ACTU-Solo, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> J. L. Hawke or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> C. White ford, gave evidence before the Commission. </para>

          <para class="block">I should have thought that if there were grounds for believing that there was some error in the Commission&#39;s findings, then other persons also would have undertaken to present a case to the Commission and to appear before it. I am not in a position to judge whether they should or should not have done so, and I do not think it is possible for this Senate to make any judgment outside what the Commission itself has brought down. I should say that it is not impossible that some aspects of the Commission&#39;s report are not as complete as they might be. Perhaps more evidence might have been given or should have been given. I do not know, but it would be wrong for the Senate to interpret the Commission&#39;s findings purely for the purpose of denigrating another individual. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> apparently had the opportunity to give evidence, but I emphasise that he was not called. </para>
          <para>During his contribution to the debate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> read the statutory declaration that I believe was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> to the Commission this morning, but that was no more than a series of assertions. I listened to it being read, and it seemed to me that it contained no fresh evidence which would justify a re-opening of the case on the ground of that statutory declaration. That is a matter for the Commission, but it is not a document, I suggest, which would strengthen in any way the case that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> put. There are one or two aspects of the matter which, I suppose, are interesting and which should be given some consideration in this debate. I refer in particular to one of the documents which were placed before the Royal Commission on Petroleum by my Department, the Department of Minerals and Energy. It was a letter from the then Minister for Minerals and Energy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> to the Australian Gas Light Co. This document was tabled for the Royal Commission&#39;s purposes. </para>

          <para class="block">That is a significant paragraph. We can see from that that assertions that all culpability lay with the Australian Council of Trade Unions or certain individuals in the ACTU could not be reasonably sustained. The only other matter to which I wish to draw the attention of the Senate is assertions that in some way <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> was given access to information concerning the Government&#39;s decision in respect of the Budget proposal to levy the oil industry. I want to make it quite clear that I believe there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that any leaks of this nature were given. Certainly, nothing consciously would ever have been done. </para>
          <para>It is all very well to quote newspaper articles on what happened and to quote what was reported in the Press of 6 May. But I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> as a lawyer would use newspaper articles as evidence in a court to substantiate the argument of his claim. I think he would exercise more care and ensure that material used to substantiate his case would be on safer ground than a newspaper report. But the fact remains that the purpose of the debate is not lost on the Government. Of course it is intended to denigrate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and also to cloud the issues that confront the Australian people at the present time. It aims to draw away, if possible, in the media the real issue of whether or not the Opposition is going to pass the Appropriation Bills. This of course is a mechanism whereby public attention can be diverted by some elements of doubt and assertions being made by the Opposition in order to capture the headlines in tomorrow &#39;s Press and in the media generally. But I do not think the Australian people will fall for that sort of argument. </para>
          <para>As I have mentioned, the Commission&#39;s report makes it quite clear that fresh evidence may be brought before the Commission at any time. It would then be a matter of judgment for the Commission as to whether that fresh evidence should be heard. That, I suggest, is the essential point of this debate. If in fact fresh evidence is available then anyone is at liberty to place that evidence before the Commission. The Commissioner has made that quite clear. I think that my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, when he speaks as the Minister responsible for royal commissions, will have something to say on this matter. But this is the paramount point: There is no intention or desire I am sure on the part of the Commission to refuse a proper hearing to any person or persons who feel that they have fresh evidence to put before the Commission. That is the position as it exists and as it should exist. This debate in this chamber today in no way will assist in elucidating any further findings by the Commission if that evidence is not put where it should be, and that is before the Commission. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> appears entirely to misconceive the nature and the importance of this debate. The debate concerns a well publicised and notorious parcel of crude oil- 420 000 barrels that had been the subject of a law dispute in the Supreme Court of Victoria. The multinational company Allied Petrochemicals Pty Ltd was successful in establishing its title to that crude. Within days of obtaining that title it was offering that crude to the market at $5 a barrel and it sent letters to all the major oil companies making that offer. It was enabled by the fixed price scheme operated by the Australian Government to purchase the crude from the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, the producer, at $2. 10 a barrel. The crude absorption policy of the Government required that nobody who purchased crude at that fixed price should be in a position to make a windfall profit. Therefore, the approach of Pc to the market was quite a blatant attempt to get an illicit profit. BHP&#39;s return on the transaction was about $900,000. Pc, on selling to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> &#39;s company, returned to itself a windfall profit of $1.2m. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> &#39;s company, by obtaining the crude on the terms it did, was able to get a cost advantage on that purchase, as compared with the very minimum of import prices overseas and other operations in Australia, of between $lm and $ 1.5m. </para>

              <para>-I pass the list to the  Deputy President  and to honourable senators on the Government side. It will be seen that on 7 May this year Allied Petrochemicals Pty Ltd offered this bulk crude to all the oil companies five or six of them. On being offered this oil at $5 a barrel each company replied: &#39;That is prohibited by government policy. We cannot purchase&#39;. As counsel before the Royal Commission on Petroleum said: &#39;If the companies had been able to purchase lawfully each of them would have loved to have got such a bargain&#39;. So <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> &#39;s company comes on the scene. On 1 6 May the Pc company gave the Hawke company the option to purchase at $5 a barrel. A week later, on 23 May, that option was exercised and a contract of sale and purchase was entered into by Pc selling and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> &#39;s company purchasing at $5 a barrel. This was the very sum which all the companies had said, to their knowledge, was prohibited by the Government edict. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In that week events took place. One event was the negotiation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Leonard</inline> of Ampol Petroleum Ltd for the refinement of this crude. The ACTU company had those arrangements sewn up before the option was exercised. In the same week, from 19 to 21 May, the ACTU executive was meeting in Perth. There <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> was proclaiming that he was getting the approval of the executive to his company going on. On 24 May ACTU-Solo admitted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> to the directorship of that company thereby consummating the amalgamation of ACTU-Solo. All these events took place in the week from 16 to 24 May. Is anybody so gullible in this place to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> the presiding genius over the whole of this enterprise which was publicised in this way, was not conscious of a purchase at $5 a barrel? This would give the vendor a profit of $1.2m, a windfall profit contrary to Government policy. There was no time lost in getting delivery of the oil and we find the refiner, Ampol Petroleum Ltd, through its manager <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Leonard</inline> in Brisbane on 28 May making a public statement that the United State-owned chemical company appears to have made a quick profit of more than $ 1 m by selling its allocation of Australian crude oil to ACTU-Solo, that is, 5 days after the option was exercised. There was a prominent headline about a &#39;$ 1 m deal on ACTU-Solo petrol&#39; on the public pages of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> based on the statement by a prominent figure in the oil industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Leonard,</inline> the manager of Ampol. We then get letters from Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd asking &#39;Are we authorised to deliver&#39;. </para>
          <para>On a memo of 13 June we find one of the officers of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor&#39;s</inline> Department in manuscript writing: &#39;The question is whether Pc is receiving a windfall premium&#39;. On 14 June <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> wrote a letter headed &#39;Private and Confidential&#39; to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> sending him a copy of an agreement showing the price to be in accordance with Government policy at $2.10 a barrel. On 18 June <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> sent fraternal greetings and in a letter marked &#39;Personal and Confidential&#39; acknowledged <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> &#39;s letter. He then sent <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter&#39;s</inline> letter to Melbourne for consideration by his officers for urgent advice on a confidential basis. On 24 June the officer in Melbourne returned a memorandum- and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> having proclaimed himself before the Parliament as not being a fool would hardly need to be alerted in these terms by his officer- in which he made it clear that there was something to be sniffed about this letter. He said that Pc was selling at the same price as it purchased. Then he pointed out that there was no windfall profit to Pc which would not even recover the costs of the paper work involved, let alone the cost of the High Court action. </para>
          <para>If there is in fact no additional secret deal conditional on this one, we can only speculate that the benefit to Pc must come later when ACTUSolo will be seeking bulk storage facilities in capital cities. So if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor&#39;s</inline> native intuition was not alerted by these facts, the officer pointed out that Pc was much more foolish than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> for selling at the purchase price. It was not even recovering the cost of its paper work or its court costs. If there was a secret deal it was to be explained by the provision of bulk storage facilities. That is one of the flimsy excuses which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> put forward to explain the second deal and which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Collins dismissed as fantastic. Where did the officer in Melbourne get the idea that this obvious subsequent agreement was a secret deal and was going to be explained by the provision of storage facilities? One would think that all those matters would explain to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Connor that there was a secret deal in the offing. The inference is that he well knew it. So clearly is that to be accepted, that if one looks to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor&#39;s</inline> answer in the Parliament to a question asked of him on 3 September one will find that he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I had no doubts as to the nature of the transaction. From as early as December of last year both the respective litigants in a case in the Supreme Court of Victoria had been endeavouring to flog off their respective rights, or what they claimed to be their rights, to this crude at $5 per barrel. There had been letters sent out by Allied Petrochemical Pty Ltd in May, immediately after it had won the case, to every major oil company offering it to them and it was in all cases rejected. It was a natural thing for me immediately when approached first on the matter and before receiving any documentation specifically to raise the point that it was this same crude. I had no doubt, and 1 insisted, that it should be an orthodox transaction and nothing beyond that. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He also said that he had discussed it fully with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter. Mr Souter</inline> gave evidence that the discussion was one in which he was quite clearly told that there could be a subsequent commercial transaction for additional benefits. That is so inconsistent with the former Minister&#39;s position that the former Minister is bound to appear and give evidence in explanation of the matter. Until that is done the overwhelming inference is that it is a corrupt transaction. </para>

            <para>-The motion before the Senate is one under standing order 64 to discuss as a matter of urgency the need for further inquiry into the matters that have been mentioned in the debate this afternoon. It is a fatuous motion because it can achieve nothing and it ignores the fact that there are 3 avenues open to the members of the Opposition or their friends and supporters to pursue this matter if they wish to do so. Of course, not only is it fatuous but also we all know that rather disconsolately this is put on as the substitute performance for today because the test match involving Pakistan will apparently not take place, at least today. I can understand the Opposition not wishing to disappoint the crowd and putting on the next best performance it could muster at short notice. It is the ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd deal. </para>

It is apparent that this motion is aimed essentially at the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> who is the one person outside the Government whom the Opposition most fears; fears because of his forthrightness; fears because of the manner in which he exposes some of the capitalistic deals that have been a disgrace to this country; fears because when, from the cover of privilege of Parliament, accusations are made against him he answers like an honest man in a ringing voice and says: &#39;Repeat that outside and you will be sued &#39;; and fears, fourthly, because he has a very good track record in defamation proceedings. </para>

              <para>-Senator Greenwood was speaking about 5 August. I am speaking about 28 August. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> gave evidence as to what he knew about the ACTU-Solo deal he did not mention that he had, as he claims now, some foreknowledge of what was in the Budget. Let us look at the chronology to see why it was impossible for him to have any foreknowledge. The relevant dates have been given. I remind the Senate that the agreement of the Minister was forthcoming on 26 June, having been sought in writing on 17 June. It was not until about 10 days after the agreement of the Minister was sought that the possibility of a tax on crude oil production, as part of this Budget, was for the first time canvassed, and it was not until 30 July, some 6 or 7 weeks after the application was made and some 5 weeks after the application was approved, that any decision was made by the Government that the Budget would contain such a provision. This discredited person I say that he is discredited by his involvement, by his behaviour and by his record in relation to this Party- now comes along and says: &#39;Oh, in some way I had foreknowledge of this $2 a barrel deal&#39;. Would any just person give that statement any credence? I suggest not. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Before I pass on to other matters, let me say as a comparative newcomer to this chamber that I am appalled by the manner in which members of the Opposition, under cover of privilege, are constantly making charges of the most serious conduct against individuals in the community and are proceeding to canvass those charges in this chamber, and then are reaching conclusions, by their own judgment, as to the guilt of those persons. It is a complete debasement, I suggest, of the right of audience in the Senate. It is a complete debasement of the powers of this Senate. I suggest that history will so record it and condemn those who are so constantly responsible for the abuse. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline>began this morning by saying in effect- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> has referred to his exact words- that he was not going to reach any conclusions against anybody, that all he wanted was an inquiry. As a former first law officer of the Crown in this Commonwealth he proceeded then to prosecute, to judge, to convict and to execute. That is the concept of justice of the former first law officer of the Crown in this Commonwealth. The sooner the Senate gets down to its proper business of dealing properly with legislation and not deferring it, as has happened with the Budget, instead of going on to something which appears to be the best bet of the day but which will turn out to be a damp squid, the better it will be for the reputation of the Senate through the cameras of history. </para>
          <para>There is one simple answer in relation to this matter. We will not be voting on the matter of urgency, so the will of the Senate will never be known. There is one simple answer to this and that is the answer which was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bowen,</inline> the Minister for Manufacturing Industry, in the House of Representatives on 7 October. He suggested that anyone who has any relevant information ought to go either personally or by counsel to the royal commission, which fortuitously is sitting and which is capable of determining whether or not any fresh evidence ought to be considered by the commission. I refer to the terms of reference of the commission. They were issued by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> on 12 September 1973. The first paragraph reads as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To inquire into and report upon- </para>
            <list type="decimal">
              <item label="(1)">
                <para>All aspects - </para>
              </item>
            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I emphasise the word &#39; all &#39;-  of the production by refining, and the marketing and pricing, in Australia of all types of petroleum, diesel and other fuels ... </para>
          <para class="block">Under sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) of paragraph (2) there are 2 terms of reference which are even more specific. But the general head of inquiry is ample, I suggest, to embrace any further evidence that anyone can legitimately produce in relation to this matter. I do not know whether the Opposition is directing criticism- it has not been prepared to say so as yet- against the royal commissioner on the basis that the inquiry should have gone farther than it did, but I invite the attention of the Senate to page- 45 18 of the transcript where senior counsel assisting the commissioner said this in conclusion: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I would submit that the decisions Your Honour has to make concerning the facts of this matter are quite straightforward. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Senior counsel put it on a very simple basis and the judge accepted that situation. He left the matter open for anyone else who wanted to make any submissions to do so. Incidentally, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> was treated the same as counsel appearing for the parties and in due course, after the evidence had been given, made his actual submissions to the commission. In those submissions he did not mention any question of foreknowledge of Budget details. </para>
          <para>The Royal Commission, having heard all the evidence that it considered relevant- all that was of profit to it- and having considered the arguments of counsel appearing for various parties and of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse,</inline> made a clear cut decision and recommendation which this morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> said he accepted. That is the point; he said that he accepted the decision. The principal finding was that there had been deceit and misrepresentation vis-a-vis the former Minister for Minerals and Energy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> cannot have it both ways. He proceeded to be a prosecutor and a judge- only time prevented him from being an executioner- in saying in effect that that finding could not be sustained on the evidence and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> must have known this and he must have known that. The analytical approach of the lawyer says that it must be so because of certain dates and certain facts. </para>
          <para>The Opposition through its remaining speakers will say either that it has confidence in the Royal Commission or it has not. If it has no confidence in the Royal Commission it ought to move a substantive motion that the terms of reference of the Commission be aborted. What is the use of this incompetent, if that is the allegation, Royal Commission, which has already been in progress for some 2 years and which I understand will continue its inquiries for some 1 8 months or so from now, continuing to waste funds that presumably, because of the Senate&#39;s action in other respects, do not exist? That is just crazy. Let the Opposition come clean. If the members of the Opposition will not accept the challenge of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> to repeat their charges outside the Parliament so that he can take appropriate action and maintain his track record, they ought not to try to achieve the same political result by maligning, by implication, the royal commissioner whose finding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> who raised this matter of urgency said that he accepted, and as to which the second honourable senator speaking for the Opposition side said could not possibly be right. </para>

          <para class="block">One would believe that under normal Labor Party policy further disclosures on this matter would be welcomed. One would hold the view that where substantial sums of money appear to have been made by commercial enterprises, that would be a matter of criticism by Labor and it would be most anxious to bring the matter to the fore. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett</inline> commenced his remarks by criticising <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and the Opposition for bringing on what he said was a specious matter. He attempted to say that the Khemlani business was of more importance and, because of that, the Opposition should not be pursuing the ACTU matter. I think that is an unfair interpretation, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett</inline> looked at page 1436 of last Thursday&#39;s Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he would know that it was the Opposition which deferred pursuing this matter on that day because at that stage the Government was seeking to give some assurances as to what it might do about the matter. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett</inline> was particularly unfair about that. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett</inline>also referred to the capitalist market. Indeed, if ever an inquiry needed to be held into the capitalist market it is on this matter of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and its directors. How would this Government perform with any other commercial undertaking that contravened Government policy and gained for itself $lm or more? If that happened the greatest criticism in the world would come from this Government, but that has not happened. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett</inline> then went on to discuss discredited persons. If in this chamber we started discussing discredited persons we would be talking more about members of Parliament in another place than we would about officials or others outside this place. My entry into this debate is an attempt to clear the name of a man for whom I have had great respect foi many years. I have had some experience with what happens when an attempt is made to discredit people. In this instance a man in my State who has devoted himself honestly to the work of unions and who, in concert with others, is a director, of an enterprise finds that as a result of an inquiry he is the one who is picked out and is left by his other directors to take the full burden of whatever criticism is made, criticism which in actual fact might wreck the whole career of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter.</inline> As far as I am concerned, that is not good enough. </para>
          <para>Could I take up one other matter mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt.</inline> One becomes very sick of it when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> stands up and says untruthfully that nobody has asserted that there has been any wrongdoing in this loans business. Of course, the fact is that that has been asserted on a number of occasions in this place and outside. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> today criticised <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> for saying that there may have been favours to certain people, and he said that statements such as that are never substantiated. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> to look over the record because he has made an incorrect assumption there. Does he recall the suggestions made about the purchase by this Government of the trade union premises in Hobart? Does he remember that on many occasions I have raised the matter of the preference given to Marrickville Margarine Pty Ltd to enable it to be the one company to manufacture in the Australian Capital Territory? Does he remember my asserting that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> overrode the foreign takeovers report to allow that same company to dispose of its shares in a particular food group to an overseas corporation? We have the present situation of the Government paying in excess of $300,000 a year for the use of government premises.

              <para>-My apologies, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy</inline> President; I did not hear you calling for order and I did not notice you stand at that time. There is no doubt that a reading of the evidence presented to the Royal Commission on Petroleum raises grave doubts as to the occurrences relating to the ACTU-Solo deal. There is also little doubt that, without media inquiry and without the constant sifting of statements by the Opposition, no truth would have emerged regarding this matter. I may also say that, without the sifting of evidence and media inquiry, no truth would have been forthcoming about the overseas loans matter, and the results of that have been particularly significant. It is my view that the full facts of both these matters have not been given by the Government. The Government has stated that it believes in open government. I ask: Why does it not welcome an inquiry so that the  President  of the Australian Labor Party and the former Minister for Minerals and Energy, who resigned because statements he made to the Parliament were apparently untrue, can be cleared? These matters in relations to the ACTU-Solo business should be cleared up. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The motion for a discussion of a matter of urgency is one way in which the Opposition wishes to pursue the facts so that the public will have a clear interpretation of what did happen in this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> in the limited time available to them, have put very clearly the questions that are raised. The Government has stated that crude oil must not be sold for more than $2.10 per barrel. The product was offered to a variety of private enterprise commercial undertakings throughout Australia and the offer finally was taken up by a wing of the Australian Labor Party- the Australian Council of Trade Unions- in conjunction, apparently, with the Solo company. A company was formed and an agreement was made for the purchase of that crude oil at $5 a barrel. One would not doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> was aware of the facts. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> is a very intelligent man who knew, as was stated in the evidence, that this product was being offered to companies at $5 a barrel as early as January of this year. Finally, when the offer to purchase the product was sought to be taken up at great commercial advantage to that wing of the Australian Labor Party, the purchase apparently was approved by the Minister. </para>
          <para>The report of the royal commission states that the Minister was misled. I am not prepared to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> was such a fool. I do not believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> was not aware that this product, having been offered all over Australia at $5 a barrel, was sold at that figure to ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd. I believe that the information on that transactions should be brought to light in a further inquiry. I do not believe that full investigation was made into the commercial transaction and the business arm of the Labor Party by the royal commission. I believe that in many areas it must have sought either not to gain the actual facts or not to call before it people who could give proper evidence. I wish to quote the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter.</inline> Indeed, it is he whom I would seek to protect in this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> stated, as recorded at page 4276 of the transcript of evidence of the commission &#39;s inquiry:   my clear understanding of the concept and the basis of the sale of the crude was that the commercial sale was distinctly not a matter for the Government&#39;s approval. </para>
          <para class="block">No man could have obtained that view unless he had the approval of the Minister to such an undertaking. I make the point that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> is not given to lying. He stated his belief and that belief could be gained only by his communication either with the Department of Minerals and Energy or with the former Minister. I believe that it is essential in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter&#39;s</inline> interest that we establish the truth in this matter. </para>
          <para>Another matter of concern, of course, is where this great benefit of $1.5m- if that is the limit of it- finally flowed. One must imagine that it flowed to the corporation, ACTU-Solo Enterprises. I think that matter should be investigated. But the matter of gravest concern that I have, having somewhat of a commercial background - </para>

            <para>- The Australian public are very quickly becoming sick and tired of the way in which this Parliament has been used over the last 12 months by the Opposition and, indeed, is still being used to defame, to traduce, to vilify and to besmirch the reputation of decent Australians. I suggest that it is time that the Opposition realised the damage it is doing to the reputation of this institution. Earlier this year the Senate was used as a chamber of inquisition when the Opposition brought public servants to the Bar of the Senate. Then, for the first time in Australia&#39;s history, the Opposition dragged a private Australian citizen to the Bar of the Senate to give evidence. A foreign gentleman came to Australia some three or four weeks ago. He told us then, through the media, than on legal advice he would not say anything. He departed from our shores. Now he has been brought back. There is some talk around the place about that gentleman being brought to the Bar of the Senate. I suggest that the muck-raking and the use of this place of privilege to attack, defame and libel ordinary decent Australians are contemptible actions on the part of the Opposition. Having regard to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> has just said, it appears that even royal commissioners who do not bring in the right findings as far as the Opposition is concerned are to have their reputations challenged. The Leader of the Opposition in another place <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on 2 October last directed this question to the Prime Minister: </para>

            <para>I ask the Prime Minister: Does it trouble him as a matter of elementary justice that all the sworn testamentary and documentary evidence which was presented to the Royal Commission on Petroleum and which could have exonerated <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> and the Australian Council of Trade Unions of the charge of deliberate deceit of the Government was entirely overlooked by the royal commission in its report? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That sort of questioning of the probity of eminent jurists of Australia by leading members of Parliament is nothing but contemptible. The fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Collins has had a long and distinguished career both at the Bar and as a judge. He was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1932 and during the course of his legal practice at the Bar he had a very wide and diverse career. He was appointed an acting judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 1955. He has been on the bench for some 20 years. He was appointed  chairman  of the Electoral Districts Commission of New South Wales. He has been a member of the Archives Authority of New South Wales. He was  chairman  of the Crown Employees&#39; Appeal Board of New South Wales in 1964. As 1 have said, he has been a judge for 20 years. He is a distinguished jurist of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. For the last 2 years he has been the Commissioner of the Royal Commission on Petroleum which was established by this Government. </para>
          <para>Having regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Collins&#39; long career at the Bar and his experience over 20 years as a prominent jurist, I say it is scandalous that the findings of the commission on the evidence which was presented to it are brought into query by members of the Opposition. I have referred to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition in another place. There are other like references right through the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> It is disgraceful that the Leader of the Opposition should cast such an aspersion on the royal commissioner. The Government appointed the royal commission to inquire into and to report on the petroleum industry as long ago as 1973. It was given very wide terms of reference. I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the terms of reference of the Royal Commission on Petroleum. </para>

              <para>-When this matter came up late in August or early in September the Government asked the commission to report upon the circumstances. The commission presented its report to  His Excellency  the Governor-General on 19 September. Because Parliament was not sitting at that time the Government was unable to present the report to the Parliament until 30 September. The first day on which the Parliament sat after 19 September was 30 September. It was the first day of the second sessional period of this session and it cannot possibly be said by the Opposition that there was any attempt by the Government to conceal or to run away from the findings of the royal commission. These findings were presented to the Governor-General who in turn forwarded them to the Government. Immediately they were tabled in the Parliament. Since that time, 30 September, we have had question after question, we have had a debate on a matter of public importance in the House of Representatives and today we have a debate on an urgency motion in this place. Time after time the Government has said that if the Opposition has any evidence to present it should present it not to this Parliament but to the royal commission that was established by the Government as long ago as 1973. The Prime Minister himself in response to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair, Deputy</inline> Leader of the National Country Party in another place, on 2 October said, among other things: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">I understand that no member of the Opposition, despite the accusations which have been made in this place almost daily, has taken up that challenge. I now invite the Opposition if it has any evidence to present to  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Collins to go to the royal commission which resumed its sittings today and present such evidence to the royal commission. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Woodhouse, who has figured prominently in the royal commission hearings, has asked the commission to re-open its inquiries into the affair. I understand that he presented an affidavit to the royal commission. I am not suggesting for one moment that the royal commission released the terms of the affidavit to the newspapers but suddenly, for whatever reason and no matter who released it, though I suggest it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse,</inline> they appeared in the Melbourne Age. Then we had this hullabaloo and cry from the Opposition for a re-opening of the hearing. Perhaps it is significant that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> is a former executive of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party. Perhaps it is significant that he was expelled from the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party. Perhaps it is significant that he became a member of the Democratic Labor Party. Perhaps it is significant that he ran as a Democratic Labor Party candidate against Labor Party candidates on 2 occasions. If that is the sort of person the Opposition is hanging its hat on in order to re-open the inquiry I suggest that it looks at what is in the material available. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline>has now had his affidavit published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and, in fairness to him, he has accepted the invitation of the Prime Minister that anyone wanting to give evidence should go to the royal commission and ask to give evidence. I am told that on the resumption of the royal commission&#39;s hearings in Sydney this morning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> presented himself and asked that the inquiry be re-opened. I can tell the Senate that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Liddell,</inline> counsel for the Government, stated to the royal commission that so far as his instructions were concerned, any person with, evidence would be welcome to submit it to the commission but it must be in the correct form. He said that no instructions had been given to him as yet about re-opening the inquiry or extending the terms of reference and that the Commissioner should decide these matters in the light of the evidence presented. In other words, he said it was for the Commissioner to determine what developments should take place having regard to the type of evidence presented to the royal commission. </para>
          <para>I am advised that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fisher,</inline> the counsel assisting the royal commission, said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> had not presented evidence but had merely made assertions and allegations and that he, the counsel assisting the commission, would welcome any evidence, but in the absence of evidence there was no case so far as he could see why the hearing of this matter should be reopened. He recommended to the presiding judge,  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Collins, that the application to reopen be denied. I have been told that argument ensued before the royal commission on the subject. After <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> had tendered his affidavit or had his affidavit read at the commission and after hearing submissions by counsel,  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Collins stated that he would consider the matter of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> &#39;s application to have the hearing reopened and advise his decision this week, probably on Thursday. A copy of the transcript is to be furnished to my Department as soon as possible. </para>
          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Woodhouse</inline> has gone to the royal commission and asked the royal commission to reopen the inquiry and the investigation, I suggest also that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch, Mr Anthony,</inline> the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood, Senator Wright</inline> or anyone else who wants to produce evidence should go along to the royal commission and present to the royal commission the evidence that they say they have. I am amazed at the attitude of the Opposition. It, by the terms of its motion, has called for a further inquiry into a matter which has already been referred by the Government to the royal commissioner and on which the royal commissioner has already reported. The Government has already tendered its report to the Parliament but, not agreeing with the findings of the royal commission, the Opposition again wants to traduce, vilify and defame people in this Parliament. </para>
          <para>Now the Opposition has called in this urgency motion for a further inquiry. I draw the attention of members of the Opposition to the terms of the speech on the Budget on 27 August of this year by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers).</inline> He said, amongst other things: </para>

            <para>Never has there been a government so anxious to inquire into trivia at the taxpayers&#39; expense.

That, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> no doubt is one of the areas in which the Government found it impractical to cut expenditure. </para>

          <para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate was then criticising and castigating the Government for having set up a number of royal commissions to inquire into matters affecting the Australian people, including the Royal Commission on Petroleum, but, that commission having presented its report to the Parliament on the subject matter into which it was inquiring, the Opposition has now come out and said: &#39;We are not satisfied with that report. We want a further inquiry&#39;. All I can say is that if the Opposition wants a further inquiry and if it asserts that it has further evidence it should go along to the royal commission and present that evidence. If the Opposition wants a further inquiry it is up to the Opposition to produce the evidence in the correct place and in the right manner and not to make assertions, wild accusations and allegations in this place that vilify and defame ordinary, decent citizens. I suggest to the Opposition that it is a case of &#39; money up or shut up &#39;. </para>

            <para>- It is quite clear to me that anybody who read the report that has been produced by the Royal Commission on Petroleum would be anxious to have further inquiries made into the activities of certain people to whom we have referred this afternoon. I would have thought that the Special Minister of State <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland),</inline> who has just resumed his seat, would have been only too anxious to clear the allegations that have been made, based on what I believe to be significant evidence if one cares to read the document to which I have referred. It is interesting to note the red faces of and the silence from Government senators during this debate. I believe it is a mark of their guilt in this whole sordid affair. Obviously they are condoning the practices of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in this ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd deal. In my opinion, the debate has highlighted again the path of deception that has been traversed by this Government ever since it came to office. The debate has compounded the deceit of the loan scandal and brought into focus the way in which the ACTU has behaved in this ACTU-Solo affair. I believe it is one of the reasons why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan</inline> put on the Pontius Pilate act during the last State election campaign and washed his hands of the Australian Labor Party. He did not want to be identified with a discredited Federal Labor government. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter,</inline>a prominent member of the ALP, has claimed that he has been maligned by the interim report of the royal commission and that the Government has been whitewashed. Yet another scapegoat has been sacrificed on the altar of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> or the Government. The Commission&#39;s finding of deceit and misrepresentation by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> and other directors of ACTU-Solo relied substantially on evidence that the former Minister for Minerals and Energy and his Department had not been aware of a second supplementary agreement with respect to the purchase of crude oil. The Minister claimed that he granted approval for the sale of crude on the basis of the government approved price of $2.10 per barrel and that he was ignorant of the second arrangement which lifted the price to $5 per barrel. Where does the  President  of the ALP and Managing Director of ACTU-Solo, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> fit into this picture? This sordid situation is a repeat of the Whitlam Conn or overseas loans affair, lt is quite clear that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> were an efficient managing director he would have known about this deal. He is as much to blame as his co-directors, if not more so, I believe, and can be lined up with the Prime Minister in this regard because the Prime Minister is as responsible as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> for the loans affair. </para>

              <para>-The purpose of the Legal Aid Bill is to enable an independent statutory authority- the Australian Legal Aid Office- to provide legal assistance generally in the Federal area; to establish an independent advisory commission to undertake research and to tender policy advice to the Government regarding the provision of legal aid in Australia; and to enable suitable arrangements to be made for a co-operative undertaking in legal aid between the Australian Government, State governments, the legal profession, welfare organisations and the like. I would remind the Senate that legal aid is presently available in one form or another under a large number of Australian statutes. Reference may be made by honourable senators to the list set out in page 2 of the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated. Of particular importance is the provision in the Family Law Act, which specifically gives to the Australian Legal Aid Office the task of providing legal assistance subject to its &#39;means and needs&#39; test in matters arising under that Act. It is expected that these matters alone will number at least 40 000 in the first year of operation of the Act. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>It is important, also to realise the extent of the advice and information that the Governmentand, indeed, the Opposition- have had available to assist them in approaching the question of Federal legal aid legislation for Australia. Extensive research has been carried out not only in Australia but also overseas, especially in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. In July 1973 the Government set up the Legal Aid Review Committee under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Roy</inline> F. Turner, a prominent Sydney solicitor and a Vice-President of the Law Council of Australia, and in December 1973 requested Professor R. Sackville, Commissioner on Law and Poverty, to prepare a report on legal aid in Australia. The Government has been assisted by the 2 reports of the Committee and the report of the Commissioner, all of which have been published. </para>
          <para>Of great significance in drafting this legislation has been the experience gained in operating the nationwide program of the Australian Legal Aid Office which was set up by the former Attorney-General under administrative arrangements. This legislation, therefore, does not create a legislative framework in any abstract way but builds upon a substantial foundation- a foundation, I add, which has the support of 94 per cent of the Australian people right across party lines. It is of the greatest importance, when considering the proposal of the Opposition to refer this Bill to a committee, to recall that the Australian Legal Aid Office has been operating for over 2 years. It employs some 160 lawyers and 220 support staff. It has already opened 33 branch and regional offices across Australia and is shortly to open more. Personal interviews during which advice and assistance is given alone number some 150 000; they currently number about 15 000 a month. </para>
          <para>We are not engaged in a theoretical exercise, but in a practical one. To refer this legislation to yet another committee as though the 33 offices and 380-odd staff of the Australian Legal Aid Office did not exist and the reports of the Committee and the Commissioner had never been made, is nothing less than absurd. If honourable senators wish to inform themselves about legal aid, they can easily do so through the resources of the Parliamentary Library or, still better, walk into any office of the Australian Legal Aid Office. There is no need to form a committee. Government senators will be happy to assist the senators opposite with any information they require. </para>
          <para>Having made those introductory remarks, I wish to pass to the Bill. It is important, I think, to set out the fundamental principles which it embodies. And, whatever differences they may be as to detail, I venture to hope that there will be no disagreement about these principles. </para>
          <para>First, a salaried service is a necessary component of a comprehensive legal aid scheme. This is the view held in every common law country which has grappled with the problem. In the United Kingdom, where a host of charitable salaried law centres have sprung up in response to evident need, the Law Society has been pressing for years for funds to set up a salaried service of its own. In Canada, there are strong moves towards establishing salaried services, even in Ontario where the profession which set up the Legal Aid Scheme in the first place originally opposed a salaried service; the most recent comprehensive scheme, established in Quebec, relies heavily on salaried lawyers. The basic pattern in the United States is the salaried neighbourhood law centre. </para>
          <para>Salaried lawyers in community law offices make the law accessible to disadvantaged people who are wary of resorting to private practitioners even when they are available. The advantages of specialisation in so called &#39;poverty law&#39; are obvious. Those who consider that a salaried service is unnecessary or should be confined to mere advice not only ignore the universal experience in the common law world but would commit the Government to a bottomless pit of expenditure on fees for service. Experience with the Australian Legal Aid Office program of advice and assistance short of litigation shows that it costs much less than the cost of paying the profession on a fee-for-service basis. For the provision of duty lawyer services the savings are considerable. Economies are expected in family law and other areas. Overseas research has noted similar savings. I need hardly add that the service is and should be staffed by fully qualified and independent lawyers. </para>
          <para>Second, the private legal profession is a necessary component of any adequate scheme. Not only is it a basic principle that the independence and integrity of the profession be maintained and the Bill specifically acknowledges this- but the profession must necessarily undertake the bulk of the work on behalf of assisted persons. The Office could not and would not seek to do so. At its very forefront, in clause 6 of the Bill, appears a clear statement of this principle. At the same time, the profession should be involved at the policy level. This is also provided for in the Bill. But plainly it would not be appropriate for the private profession to control the salaried service. Other questions aside, it would immediately be caught in a conflict of interest situation. </para>
          <para>Third, the Government should have a general policy role in relation to the Office. The Bill has been amended to make it perfectly clear that there can be no interference in particular matters. The professional independence of the lawyers of the Office is specifically guaranteed. But the Government must be able to set general priorities and ensure that a truly rational service is undertaken. I might point out to honourable senators that the United Kingdom legislation provides for the Law Society&#39;s scheme to operate under &#39;the general guidance&#39; of the Lord Chancellor. Of course, provision is made in the Bill to ensure that no improper political pressure can be brought to bear on the Office. </para>
          <para>Fourth, an independent body representing a wide cross-section of expertise should be established to conduct research and give objective advice to the Government on policy matters and grants of financial assistance. The usefulness of such a body has been shown by the United Kingdom experience with the Lord Chancellor&#39;s Advisory Committee on legal aid. The Government has accepted the advice of the Legal Aid Review Committee as to membership of the Commission and proposes to appoint: A chairman, who is an eminent member of the profession; one representative of the Attorney-General; 2 lawyers from private practice; one member from the Australian Legal Aid Office; one from a salaried legal aid service; one from the Australian Council of Social Services; 3 from other organisations or persons interested in the provision of legal aid; and one person with expertise in law reform. The Commission has been given a wide policy-advising function to enable it to enquire and report upon the very matters that the Opposition wants to refer to a parliamentary committee. The first 2 matters that the Opposition wants such a committee to report upon, namely, the adequacy of existing legal aid services and the most effective, efficient and economical method of providing assistance, are a straight steal from clause 17 of the Bill. The difference is that the Commission is an expert body that may be expected to provide the right long term answers in the light of experience, whereas the proposed committee that, it is said, will report within a few months may be expected to advance political differences but not the cause of legal aid. </para>
          <para>Fifth, there should be as much community involvement in the work of the Office as possible consistent with the professional responsibilities of its lawyers. Part VII of the Bill provides for the establishment of consultative committees. Their basic function is to provide a focal point for cooperation between the community and the local office. This will enable the Officer to ascertain more readily and respond more appropriately to community needs. Again, the private profession will be represented on these committees, though the majority of members will be lay persons from the community. Sixth, there should be cooperation, not competition, between the Office and other legal aid schemes. It has been suggested in uninformed quarters that the Bill permits duplication of services. This is nonsense. The provisions of the Bill, particularly clauses 8 and 1 7, are designed to ensure that this does not occur. </para>
          <para>The Office is anxious to avoid duplication and has arrived at satisfactory arrangements with State schemes to ensure co-ordination and cooperation. It was put in another place that this matter should be examined by a committee. But duplication is not implicit in the legislation. If it occurs, it can be controlled in the course of administration. The policy is perfectly clear, and will be adhered to. When the 23rd Report of the Lord Chancellor&#39;s Advisory Committee on legal aid was debated in the House of Lords, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Elwyn-Jones, pointed out that private practitioners and law centres employing solicitors to give advice and assistance to the poor had complementary and not opposing or competing tasks. He remarked: &#39;It is quite ludicrous to regard the two as competing for a limited pool of work. We confront my Lords, not a pool, but an ocean &#39;. The Legal Aid Commission will be able to consider the whole position and advise the Government upon it. I point out again that the Office is a going concern and problems such as this have been or are being overcome. The legislation ought not to be delayed simply because of theoretical objections which, in the field, have already been resolved. </para>
          <para>I suggest to the Senate that there can be no real argument with the principles I have just enunciated. It is not necessary for me to go through the Bill in detail. I commend to honourable senators the detailed explanatory notes, especially the introduction, that have been circulated. These are not simply a paraphrase of the legislation, but explain the policy reasons for its provisions and outline how they will be administered. The proposal to refer the legislation to a committee is a mere farce, a cover-up to cause it to disappear from sight forever without the Opposition having to commit itself by a vote. The Australian people will not be deceived. </para>
          <para>I will not go through the objections to this Bill which were tediously reiterated in the other place by Opposition spokesmen. With the exception of the States&#39; rights issue the objections are answered by the specific provisions of the legislation or in the explanatory memorandum. Many are matters of administration, capable of resolution by the exercise of common sense. The Bill, of course, assumes that the Federal Government has a responsibility for the provision of legal aid in Australia and that this involves a direct role. This is the view taken by Federal governments since Federation. The only substantial criticism that has been made is directed to this question of policy. If the Government&#39;s view is accepted, I suggest to honourable senators that there is and can be no real argument about the terms of the legislation. Let me turn to the suggestions that have been made by the Opposition spokesmen on this point. </para>
          <para>The Opposition&#39;s policy was stated in another place in the following terms: The Australian Government has a legitimate and proper role in the provision of legal aid services throughout Australia; it must have a very direct interest in and responsibility for such services; the service should represent a co-operative involvement of the State and Federal Governments, the legal profession and other professionals such as social workers, and the assisted public; and a legal aid commission should be established in each State, by State legislation, supported by Federal financial assistance. These propositions may be summarised thus: The Federal Government must pay the piper; it cannot call the tune; it must not even join the dance. Putting to one side the particular issue raised by these propositions, I suggest to the Senate that very little will be gained by referring to a committee the hackneyed question of States&#39; rights. Surely this has been debated enough. The Opposition no doubt has its view; we have ours. If we have not resolved it by now, a committee would not achieve agreement. I suggest that the following considerations would lead honourable senators to the view that the Australian Government has a direct and necessary responsibility so far at least as the provision of&#34; legal aid in the federal area is concerned. First, as a glance at Professor Sackville &#39;s research paper and the first report of the Legal Aid Review Committee will show, each State has a multiplicity of schemes in operation, funded in various ways, though largely by the Australian Government, and operated by government, the law societies and non-profit organisations. There is a substantial degree of co-operation but there are, nevertheless, many gaps in the services provided. Added to these schemes is the Australian Legal Aid Office, concentrating its efforts in the federal area. It would not be practical, or even desirable to impose a uniform, monolithic organisation on these bodies, and I suggest that honourable senators reflect upon the chances of getting State governments with their own legal aid schemes- for example, the Queensland Government with its Public Curator and Public Defender- to co-operate with the Australian Government in this area. </para>

          <para>Second, if the Australian Government is primarily responsible in the federal sphere- and there is no real debate on this premise- how can it, consistent with that responsibility hand over federal legal aid to the vagaries of 8 different commissions to be set up under State and Territory legislation? The considerable delay and disorganisation implicit in such a proposal are obvious. It is necessary to have an Australian policy on legal aid and an Australian program implemented through a legal aid office set up by and rep on sib le to the Australian Government. I interpolate here that, as a result of a recent decision of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, this legislation is urgently needed to ensure that the lawyers of the Office and those private practitioners to whom matters are referred are able to act as solicitors for legally assisted persons. The doubts raised have already caused embarrassment in the courts of some States. There must be a national approach to the resolution of problems such as this. </para>
          <para>Third, on a more practical level, if the Australian Legal Aid Office is to maintain high professional standards, it must be able to offer a career in legal aid to its lawyers. One of the main reasons for having a salaried service is to take advantage of the efficiency, competence and expertise arising from specialisation in so-called poverty or welfare law. If, as has happened in the United States, there is a high turnover of professional staff because of limited career possibilities, the standard of service available to the public must fall. This is unacceptable. A nationwide operation, with sufficient flexibility to be responsive to local needs and with an emphasis on decentralisation and individual professional responsibility is of vital importance. </para>
          <para>Fourth, because of the urgent need for legal aid to be made available to Australians, the Australian Legal Aid Office was set up administratively. The Parliament has appropriated funds for its operations. The Office has the statutory responsibility under the Family Law Act for providing legal aid in family law matters. It has the support of 94 per cent of all Australians. It has already helped some 150 000 needy people. It employs some 380 persons in 33 offices throughout Australia, and this number is increasing to cope with the enormous amount of work. The clock cannot be turned back. I am confident that, upon reflection, the Senate will pass this legislation without further delay. Surely there are no real differences between us about it. Let it not be a political issue. If 94 per cent of Australians across party lines can agree, surely 94 per cent of the Senate can do the same. </para>

        <para class="block">I now proceed to discuss this matter fairly briefly. I refer first to the message which came to the Senate from the House of Representatives. It does not seem to me to add anything new to what has already been said before. I have also been once again through the second reading speech of the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> that accompanied the introduction of this Bill in the first place. It does not in any way provide us with any new material or material about which we did not already know. </para>
        <para>Most honourable senators are familiar with the position concerning financial transactions. They operate in 3 areas- the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Loan Fund and the Trust Fund. It is obligatory that the Consolidated Revenue Fund should never be in deficit and that it must be funded. That has happened on a number of occasions with the present Government. The Fund needs to be supported because it is in excess of expenditure over revenue, although there have been occasions previously when it has been in reverse and money has been transferred out of it. As we all know, there is a massive deficit in the Government&#39;s financing. There is great apprehension and concern in the Opposition that the deficit will become much greater. That is one of the principal reasons why we have put all of these measures under very detailed inspection. We have already said why we have done that. We have already done the inspecting. Out of it we have emerged with growing apprehension about the size of the deficit, what it might eventually become, and the Government&#39;s methods of financing it. It is known to us that the Appropriation Bill (No. 1 ), consideration of which also has been deferred, would need to be amended if this Loan Bill ever went through. I think that is a most unlikely event. All honourable senators know the problem with the Consolidated Revenue Fund needing to have the massive deficit transferred out of it. No amount is stated in the second reading speech or in the legislation as to what the size of the deficit to be transferred might well become. That, of itself, is a matter of substantial moment. It is illuminated by both clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill. </para>

            <para>asked a number of questions at the conclusion of his remarks on an earlier occasion on the Loan Bill. They were answered by the Leader of the Government in the Senate when he replied to the debate on 15 October. I do not need to go through all of them again, but I do wish to refer to some of them which are of some significance. The first question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> reads: </para>
          </talk.start>
        </interjection>
        <quote>
          <para>Will the Minister re-affirm the statement of the Treasurer as recorded on page 4 1 9 of the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 2 September that &#39;Present plans envisage that only small amounts will be raised overseas in 1975-76. Small refinancing loans to cover maturing debt are planned, together with a borrowing of about $50m for on-lending to the Aid which is provided for in the Budget&#39;. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The answer to that question was as follows: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Yes. Present plans with regard to overseas borrowings are as stated in the answers to questions provided by the Acting Treasurer. The anticipated overseas borrowing activities of the Government are for small refinancing loans to cover maturing debt and for a borrowing of about $50m for on lending to the AIDC. In addition, there are expected to be small net borrowings on behalf of the Australian National Airlines Commission and Qantas Airways Ltd. These were also mentioned in the answers provided on <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> September by the Acting Treasurer- under the section dealing with net drawings under credit arrangements. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline>also asked another question, which was question No. 2 and which reads: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Will the Minister affirm that current activities in the money-markets of Europe, purporting to be directed towards the raising of substantial loans, reputedly in units of $ 1 ,000m, for Australia, have no stimulus or support from the Commonwealth Government? </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The answer is clear and unequivocal. It is: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>If there are any such activities they certainly have no stimulus or support whatsoever from the Australian Government. The Australian Government has no intention of borrowing large amounts overseas of the type mentioned at this time. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That answer seems to make the situation quite clear. On a number of occasions we are assured by the Government that it does not intend to borrow in any way substantially overseas. That statement always makes very strange reading to all of us, in the light of what we know has been going on in this country by way of overseas loan negotiations since some time about last October. The answers are not consistent. The position is not consistent. I think the Government will have some explaining to do to the Australian people in due course, when it presents itself to the people at a House of Representatives election. </para>
        <para>There is one other matter to which I think we ought to advert as part of our general concern in this whole area of government financing arising out of what might be called extremely peculiar behaviour in overseas loan negotiations plus the massive deficit of the Government which may well become greater and the financing transactions associated with that. The latest figures that are available are the ones put out by the Treasury as at 30 September. They illustrate the Government&#39;s position. It was, in effect, in total overdraft at the end of September to approximately the following extent: It had outstanding treasury bills of $850m and treasury notes of $ 1,280.4m; its bank balance had gone from a credit to a debit and it was therefore in bank overdraft as well. Its total indebtedness to the Reserve Bank of Australia, needing in due course to be refinanced or funded, at the end of September was $2,250m. They are the facts. They are certified and signed by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> and by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Wheeler, Secretary of the Treasury, in the statement which has been issued. </para>
        <para>If one looks at the position one begins to wonder what is really happening with the finances of this country. I hope the Government will understand that that is one of the principal reasons why the Opposition has been putting this whole financial transaction of the Government under severe query and severe test. As I have said on many occasions, it has not only a right to do so but also a proper responsibility to do so. As the information has emerged day by day, week by week, month by month, it has so heightened our concern that we have felt it is time the Australian people were informed of these matters and given a chance to judge the financial capacity and general probity of the Government which we presently have in this country. The interesting thing in this cash position is the way the cash has run down. I have had these figures taken out: At the end of June 1974 the Government had cash in hand of $ 1,425m. At the end of June 1975 it had run that cash in hand down to $764m. At the end of September 1975 its cash in hand was minus; it owed the bank $124m plus the balance of the money which it owed. We find ourselves also in a state of difficulty in reconciling the statements made by the Government on various occasions with reality. The same statement of the Treasurer and the Treasury officials indicates that for the 3 months ended September 1975 the total outlays of the Government were $4,948m, in rounded figures, as against $3,438m for the same 3 months of the previous year. That is a growth rate of 44 per cent in expenditure in 12 months, comparing the first 3 months of the last financial year- July, August and Septemberwith the first 3 months of this financial year. </para>
        <para>On the other hand, we know that the Supply Bills gave the Government approximately a 62 per cent advance in its expenditure this year as against last year. So we have 2 problems in determining what the Government is up to. Will it in effect, as it says it will, only expand its expenditure by 23 per cent, as stated by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech when he said: &#39;Total outlays are now estimated to increase by 23 per cent&#39;? Is that the truth? Is the truth the published figure given for the 3 months ended September which indicates 44 per cent? If all these things are the case, why a bid for Supply in May to increase the amount for 5 months by 63 per cent? In all these things one finds it very difficult to determine the true position. Our best calculation, not having access totally to the Treasury, is that the Government has in reality an ability to carry on in a Sup- ply sense until well into December, unless we are looking at a tremendous increase in expenditure well above the figures given to us and not yet disclosed. </para>
        <para>I do not think I need say a great deal more. I think I have indicated quite clearly our concern a concern which has been spread over a long period. Nothing we have seen, none of the indications given to us, none of the information supplied in relation to the various negotiations for overseas loans, in contrast to what is stated to be the Government&#39;s actual position, has satisfied our very great apprehension, and that is why we again propose to defer the Loan Bill 1975, as we deferred the Appropriation Bills. I suggest that the proper remedy for the Government is to explain in fine detail its actions in relation to all its transactions and to reconcile all the areas of difference of opinion and of statement. So I have nothing further to say, except that we believe that the Bill should be deferred again. </para>

          <para>- in reply- I think I am right in saying that the amendment that has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> is identical in its terms to the one which was moved previously. In that amendment the Opposition makes some assertions and calls on the Government to hold an election. The Loan Bill 1975 has been debated at length and I do not wish to go over the material again. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> has raised 2 points to which I feel I ought to reply. He referred to the answers which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> sought and which were tabled on the last occasion when this legislation was before the Senate. I want to emphasise that in relation to the matter of overseas loan raisings a commitment was given in the answers supplied that overseas borrowings would not be used largely for the purpose of funding the deficit. That is true and that position stands. I think it was somewhat misleading to suggest that reports of units of $1 billion being raised on the overseas markets at the behest of the Australian Government or with the support of the Australian Government are related to the answer that has been given here. The question was concerned with the raising of loans in respect of financing the Budget deficit. That is quite a separate matter to these other accusations that are being made about the Australian Government&#39;s alleged current involvement in the raising of $ 1 billion units on the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">European money market, and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> has indicated that that is simply not the case. I regret that this matter has to be raised again here because there is no evidence to support it. It is another one of those statements which are being used in order to confuse people and to give the impression that very large sums of money are still being negotiated or inquired into by this Government. That is not true, and such statements are to be rejected. </para>
        <para>The other matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> was concerned with the increase in the deficit during the September quarter. It is true that the deficit in the September quarter is higher than the deficit would be in any other quarter, and that is a trend which has been customary over the years. If we look back over the years we find that the September quarter deficit in 1971-72 was $682m when the annual deficit was $134m. The September quarter deficit expressed as a proportion of the total deficit was 5.1.I am sorry to have to recite all of these figures but it is important that they be written into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record. For the following year, 1972-73, the relevant figures were $80 lm, $709m and the proportion was 1.1. In 1973-74 the September quarter deficit was $988m, the annual deficit was $293m, and the proportion of that September quarter deficit to the total deficit was 3.4. In 1974-75 the September quarter deficit was $923m, the annual deficit was $2, 567m, and the proportion of that September quarter deficit to the total deficit was 0.4. In 1975-76 the September quarter deficit was $ 1,887m, the annual deficit is $2,798m, and the proportion of that September quarter deficit to the total deficit is 0.7. </para>
        <para>I appreciate that it would be impossible for anybody to retain those figures in his head, but the relevant factor is that it is evident that the September quarter deficit in 1975-76 is not abnormal in relation to the budgeted deficit. Indeed, it is lower than in any year in the past decade, with the exception of 1974-75 when it was 0.4. But in that year the Government by decision expanded the deficit greatly after the September quarter by 2 methods- the new expenditure decisions and the tax cuts. It is important to realise that the present position with which we are confronted insofar as the September quarter deficit is concerned is not an abnormal one. If we relate the proportion of that September quarter deficit to the total deficit, going back to 1971-72 we find the evidence shows that it is not an abnormal position. In actual aggregates the figures are quite different, but we must look at the aggregate of the deficit itself related to the September quarter deficit in each year. That is the only way in which we can get a proper picture of it. </para>
        <para>It is quite obvious that the Opposition is prepared to maintain the same position as it took when this Bill came before the Senate earlier. I presume that the numbers will be used again to carry the amendment. Obviously we will divide on it. I can only say that no matter how adamant the Opposition may feel about this matter or how convinced it is that it is right, it is evident that the majority of Australians do not think the Opposition is right. As time passes more and more Australians will come to realise that the action that has been taken to refuse the passage of this Bill and of the Appropriation Bills will not be accepted by the majority of Australians. </para>
        <para>I was interested in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton&#39;s</inline> reference to the fact that the Consolidated Revenue Fund should not normally be in deficit. Of course the whole purpose of this Bill was to enable transfers to be made to the Loan Fund to ensure that it does not go into deficit. What is the Government expected to do insofar as these defence appropriations are concerned? They are being continually debited to the Consolidated Revenue Fund which obviously must go into deficit. There is not an accounting procedure that was invented by this Government. It is a normal accounting procedure which was used by previous Governments and which will be used by future governments. Quite apart from the politics involved in the rejection of the Appropriation Bills, I believe that the Opposition&#39;s stand on this Bill is unwarranted. There is no political mileage to be gained by it. It creates difficulties in the normal accounting of the Government. One could talk oneself blue in the face but the man in the street would not have the faintest idea of what the meaning of this legislation is. But we in this chamber understand it, and I know that no one would understand it more than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> It is unfortunate that the Opposition takes its present stand on this legislation. Probably I would be wasting my time if I were to say any more on the matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I suggest that we put it to the vote. </para>

          <para>This Bill, in conjunction with the Income Tax Bill which I shall introduce shortly, will bring into effect the: new personal income tax system announced in the Budget Speech. It will also give effect to the Budget decision to continue the system of doubled rates of depreciation which applied for 1974-75 and to extend it, from 1 July 1975, to all sections of commerce and industry. </para>
          <para>The paramount objectives of the Government in introducing the new personal income tax system are twofold. One is to achieve a more equitable distribution of the burden of taxation borne by individual taxpayers, especially the single income family. The other objective is to reduce marginal rates of tax at the level of average weekly earnings. In broad terms, these aims are achieved by increasing the marginal rates of tax payable on the first $6,000 of income and reducing them on the excess over this amount, and by substituting a much more generous and equitable rebate system for the existing system of concessional deductions. Both elements of reform the new rate scale, and the change-over to rebates- are of fundamental importance. </para>
          <para>In brief, a &#39;tax rebate of $400 will replace the existing deduction of $364 for a spouse, a rebate of $200 will replace the deduction of $260 for a student child or for one child under 16 years of age, and a rebate of $150 will replace the deduction of $208 for other children under 16 years of age. These rebate amounts are far in excess of the tax value of the deductions previously allowable. They mean also that, for all taxpayers, rich and poor alike, the tax value of a dependant is exactly the same, that is, it is not, as under the old system, larger for wealthy people than it is for low-income earners. I want to make this quite clear: Our new tax scheme removes the inequitable system of concessional deductions and replaces it with a fairer system of rebates, Further, a new allowance- a rebate of $200- is to be introduced for parents without partners who are maintaining children who qualify for concessional rebates as dependants. The definition of student for the purpose of the higher of the two rebates for children is to be extended from the present definition to include any child under 25 years of age receiving full-time education at a school, college or university. Under the previous, more restrictive definition, only children between the ages of 16 and 25 could qualify as a student. </para>
          <para>Other deductions of a concessional nature, except those for housing loan interest and gifts which will continue to be deductible from income, will be replaced by reba table amounts subject to a 40 per cent rebate of tax. The minimum rebate to be allowed in this context, which I shall refer to as the general rebate, will be $540. This means that taxpayers who would otherwise claim other concessional deductions of $ 1,350 or less will not need to itemise deductions claimed the $540 rebate will be, as it were, automatic. Deductions for residents of zone A and zone B and members of the defence forces serving overseas will be replaced by rebates equal to at least 40 per cent of the deductions formerly allowable. These rebates will, of course, be additional to the general and dependant rebates. We have decided that two of the concessional deductions that were allowed under the old system will remain outside the new rebate scheme. These are for housing loan interest, and for gifts to public institutions and approved building funds. The percentage of housing loan interest allowable as a deduction at present is, in effect, means-tested by reference to the combined income of a married couple. It is not proposed to change the present basis of the concession. Also, having regard to the people it is intended to assist, it is the Government&#39;s view that the concessional deduction for housing loan interest should be viewed independently of any other concession and that interest eligible as a concession should therefore be placed outside the range of personal expenditures that are to be covered by the $540 general rebate or rebated at the proposed 40 per cent rate. As to gifts, the deduction is being retained because we believe that it is the recipient of the gift rather than the taxpayer that it is intended to benefit, although indirectly, by the concession, a redistribution of the taxation burden implies, of course, that there will be both gainers and losers. From the point of view of taxpayers collectively however, gains will exceed losses and the total amount of income tax to be paid annually by individual taxpayers will be some $205m less under the new system than it would have been if the old system had continued. Considerations of equity demand that the gainers in the redistribution should be those people who, out of a modest income, maintain dependants with little or no income of their own. This will be achieved under the new system by the generous scale of rebates for dependants. Those who will pay more tax under the new system will, for the most part, be persons without family responsibilities or members of multi income households. Turning to the technical scope of the Bill, much of it is devoted to the repeal of the provisions of the existing law relating to concessional deductions and to their reenactment in a form appropriate to a rebate system. There are also consequential amendments to other provisions of the law. I should, however, refer to education expenses. The concessional allowances for both education expenses for a child and for so-called self-education expenses are, of course, to be absorbed into the rebate system. But the limit on the amounts to be taken into account is to be increased from $ 1 50 to $250 and, in the case of self-education expenses, the range of expenditure is to be widened beyond the cost of fees, books and equipment, so as to include all expenses necessarily incurred in connection with a prescribed course of education. Self-education expenses in excess of $250 will fall for consideration under the general deduction provisions of the income tax law. In addition to the personal income tax provisions, the Bill provides also for the accelerated income tax deductions for depreciation announced in the Budget Speech. This measure represents a significant widening of the scope of the provision enacted last year to grant depreciation deductions at double ordinary rates in respect of new manufacturing and primary production plant. The new provisions will apply to all new plant that is first used or installed ready for use for the purpose of producing assessable income on or after 1 July 1975, other than certain motor vehicles and plant that qualifies for special statutory rates of* depreciation. No time limit has been set for the operation of this provision. Taxpayers will be entitled to claim deductions on eligible plant at twice the rates normally applied for income tax purposes. The increased rates will continue to apply in succeeding years until the cost of the plant has been written off or until the plant is sold or otherwise disposed of. Taxpayers may elect to forgo the accelerated allowances if they so wish. Finally, the Bill provides for the provisional tax otherwise payable in respect of 1975-76 income to be reduced or waived in certain circumstances. In the absence of a special measure, provisional tax payable in respect of 1975-76 income would be an amount equal to the 1974-75 tax in respect of income other than salary or wages. Where that tax included any amount payable as a surcharge of tax in respect of income from property, that amount will be disregarded for the purposes of provisional tax calculation. Also the Commissioner will be authorised to refrain from charging provisional tax in 1974-75 assessments in any case where it would appear that as a result of the proposed general rebate and the proposed rebates for dependants a taxpayer may not be liable to pay tax in respect of his 1975-76 income. A memorandum explaining technical features of the Bill is being made available to honourable senators. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>-I rise, not to detain the Senate long on the first reading of a money Bill, but in order to seek information which the Minister has been asked to provide over a period of months and which has not been provided. In regard to the first matter I raise I simply state that this is the third occasion on which I have raised this matter in the Senate. I do consider that, whilst there are other matters of grave concern activating us all, there are individuals whose rights ought not to be ignored simply for want of ministerial attention. </para>

            <para>- I refer to the matters on which I originally addressed representations to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron as Minister for Labor and Immigration and concerning which I am now seeking the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland as the current Minister for Labor and Immigration. The first matter relates to a gentleman by name of Ivan Pavlovic, who is a Croatian born Australian who has been denied a passport and who has been given no reason for the denial of the passport. I first became aware of this matter in the middle of 1974. I became aware of it because it was a boast of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> as the then Minister for Immigration that the Labor Government, unlike- as he said- previous Governments, had never withheld passports or citizenship on political grounds. Shortly thereafter I received information which I have endeavoured to pursue on behalf of an individual who has been denied a passport. For want of any reason being given, one can only assume the passport was denied on the political ground that he is a Croatian-born Australian and for that reason in the eyes of this present Government is a second rate Australian. He made application for a passport in July 1 974 and on 24 July he was told he could not be provided with one and he could not be provided with any reason. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Ivan</inline>Pavlovic. I wrote to the Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron, on 29 July and on 1 August I received a reply stating that immediate inquiries were being made and that the Minister would write again as soon as he had something definite. The Minister again replied on 1 6 August 1 974 stating that the application had not been refused but that it was still being processed and it was hoped that a decision would be reached shortly. Not hearing further, I wrote again on 9 November referring the Minister to his earlier letter and hoping that I could be informed. Then there was some confusion in the Minister&#39;s office. On 12 November I received a reply from the Minister stating that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pavlovic</inline> would not be granted a passport and that no reasons would be provided for the decision. On 14 November I received a letter from the Minister stating that he had requested his Department to expedite its inquiries into the matter. Obviously there was some office confusion at that time. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I replied on 18 November protesting at the failure to grant <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pavlovic</inline> a passport. At this time I instanced other matters such as the fact that he had sought to go to New York to meet his mother whom he had not seen for many years. She had been granted a visa to leave Yugoslavia to visit her daughter in New York. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pavlovic&#39;s</inline> intention to visit his mother had been the original reason for his application for a passport. Of course his mother was unable to see him because he could not leave Australia. When she applied to come to Australia, with her son paying the expense of her coming, she was told by the Consul-General in New York that she could not get a visa to come to Australia. Likewise, when he sought to have his father come to Australia various difficulties were placed in the way. I can only say with regard to those difficulties that I was ultimately given the reason- many months afterwards that there was a health condition which prevented <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pavlovic</inline> senior from leaving Yugoslavia. I am not in a position in any way to qualify that response but it indicates the problem which a person who has left Yugoslavia and who comes to this country finds when endeavouring to see his parents again. 1 take up the story. On 25 November 1974 I received a letter from the Minister in which he stated that he directed his Department to report to him on the matter as quickly as possible and that I would be written to again. But in January 1975 the Minister stated that the circumstances of the case were such that he could not vary the previous decision that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pavlovic</inline> should be issued with a document of identity as opposed to a passport. I raised this matter in the Senate on 2 1 April. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> said that he would give me an answer as soon as possible. I received no answer. I raised the matter again on 7 June 1 975. At that time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> said that there were reasons why the passport would not be granted and, that as far as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron was concerned, I could have a look at the files. If I still wanted the reasons aired after looking at the files, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron</inline> would be prepared to do that. I took up that invitation in writing, seeking to know when and where I could see the files. I have been told that this is a matter which cannot be pursued and that the files are not available to me. </para>
        <para>At the same stage in this latter period, the administration of passports was transferred from the Minister for Immigration to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I apologise for the supposition that the Minister for Immigration is still involved in this matter; it is the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee).</inline> I received no reply from the Minister for Foreign Affairs after being told in June that the Minister had referred my matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his consideration. Only within the last week- on 10 October- I received a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs in which he indicated that the files could not be looked at and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pavlovic</inline> would not be granted a passport. I simply say that this is a situation in which an Australian citizen is denied what ought to be the entitlement of every Australian citizen. </para>
        <para>It is completely unsatisfactory for this man who has been messed about for a period of approximately 16 months to have no reasons given. He is a man who has no criminal record whatsoever. The mere fact that he happens to be </para>
        <para class="block">Croatian born- notwithstanding the Government&#39;s antipathy towards Croatia or its desire not to offend the Yugoslav Government- is no adequate reason. While there is the ability in this place to pursue the cause of individuals who are denied what is common justice, there will always be people in this chamber, I hope, who will take up the cudgels on behalf of such people. Otherwise they have no answer available to them. I think it is a reflection upon the present Government&#39;s standards that it made great claims in its election platform that this would be a change which would be brought about when it came into government, but there has been no change whatsoever. </para>
        <para>The second matter which I refer to is one which directly concerns <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland as Minister for Labor and Immigration and relates to a gentleman named Milan Sogorovic who is currently in gaol in Western Australia and who, I understand, has been in gaol for a quite long period. He is about to be released from gaol and fears that he will be deported to Yugoslavia. He fled from Yugoslavia to France in approximately 1963 and was granted political asylum by the French authorities. He was a political refugee. I knew nothing of this gentleman until he wrote to me in March this year expressing his apprehension that he was about to be deported to the country from which he had fled. I sent a telegram to the then Minister for Labor and Immigration, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron, on 12 March. In it I said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I have received a letter from Milan Sogorovic at present in Fremantle Prison. </para>
          <para>He states he is being considered for deportation to Yugoslavia. </para>

          <para>I do not know the circumstances of the case but am alarmed to think that Australian Government would deport anti-Communist to a Communist regime when he has been granted political asylum as a refugee from a Communist country. </para>

          <para>Appreciate your early reply. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I then sent a fuller letter on 12 March. I received a reply by telegram on 1 8 March from the Minister&#39;s private secretary informing me that the Minister would contact me as soon as possible. I waited a considerable time before I received any reply. I wrote again to the Minister on 24 July informing him that I had written on 12 March and had received no reply except an acknowledgment from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron&#39;s</inline> private secretary. The letter which I wrote on 24 July was directed, of course, to the present Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, and I received from the Minister&#39;s immigration private secretary on 3 1 July an acknowledgment of my letter and a statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland had directed that his Department report to him as quickly as possible and that he would write to me immediately he had something definite to tell me. Since then I have had communication with the United Nations Commissioner on Refugees who is likewise concerned. I have had correspondence from a barrister in Western Australia who, at legal aid instigation, is taking up <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sogorovic</inline> &#39;s case and is seeking information. I am still awaiting a reply from the Minister. I last wrote to the Minister on 19 September and I think I sent him a telegram within the last week, but so far I have had no reply or acknowledgment. </para>
        <para>It ought not to be necessary to raise these matters in this way. I just wonder what the circumstances are surrounding any inquiries which I make about Croatian-born Australians. There are other matters which I do not raise at this time in respect of which I have been waiting for months to get information. Of course, the answers which are given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee)</inline> with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vlasic</inline> who was recently imprisoned in Yugoslavia are a matter of common knowledge. These people by and large lack friends in this country but there ought to be someone who can speak up for individual cases which warrant attention. I hope I can receive some information from the Minister. </para>

          <para>- A week or so ago, on behalf of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> I attended a Serbian function. It was a function to celebrate the eighth centenary of the birth of St Sava, who is the patron saint of all the Serbs. It is becoming increasingly clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is attempting to cast himself in the role of patron saint of all the Croats. I will deal separately with each of the propositions that he has advanced today, which are a tribute not so much to his devotion to the cause of the Croats as an example of his own obduracy. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Firstly, let us deal with the case of Ivan Pavlovic, a naturalised Australian citizen of Croatian origin who wishes to obtain an Australian passport to travel to Yugoslavia. Let us dispose for all time of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> extravagant proposition that this is a natural right of any Australian citizen which has been adhered to by all Australian governments. I need only remind him of the case of one Seiko Rover, who is perhaps the best known Croatian or man of Croatian origin in this country and who was treated in exactly the same way by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> &#39;s Government under the aegis of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon.</inline> Srecko Rover, a naturalised Australian, would appear to have had all of the rights of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ivan</inline> Pavlovic, but for reasons which it never saw fit to publicise the McMahon Government refused him an Australian passport. I will tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> here and now that it is the present intention of the Government not to give a passport to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pavlovic</inline> for good and sufficient reasons which cannot be discussed. If he wants a better hint than that, I am afraid he is asking this Government to undertake the exposure of matters which have to be kept secret by any Government. </para>
        <para>Further than that, for some curious reason <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> does not seem to be able to accept the fact that there has been an alteration of the administrative arrangements in this country and that since March of this year the responsibility for the issuance of passports has rested not with my Department but with the Department of Foreign Affairs. I do not know why it has taken until 10 October for the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee)</inline> to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pavlovic</inline> is not going to be given a passport. I know why he is not going to be given a passport. I think there is abundant reason why he should not be given a passport and I also think that there is abundant reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> should not be told why he is not going to be given a passport, just as there was abundant reason why the McMahon Government did not tell us or anybody else why Seiko Rover was refused a passport. It is characteristic of the system of double entry bookkeeping for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is famous that he sees no conflict here and exalts to an inalienable right a right that was not accepted or acknowledged by the last Liberal-Country Party Government. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline>a categorical assurance that any Australian citizen or any person of Croatian origin who is to be deported or who has rendered himself liable to deportation and who would be in genuine danger in Yugoslavia because of terrorist activities or terrorist associations will not be deported to Yugoslavia. No decision has been made to deport <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sogorovic</inline> to Yugoslavia. </para>
        <para>Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> can understand this difficulty: The word has gone around among the criminal element in the Croatian community that, if one is sent to gaol and one has rendered oneself liable to deportation under the Migration Act, the thing to do is to spread it about that one is a member of a Croatian terrorist organisation; that way one will not be deported to Yugoslavia. The task of determining whether a man will be in any peril for political reasons if he happens to be deported to Yugoslavia is a task of considerable administrative difficulty, but we certainly do not propose to be the victims of that sort of campaign. We do not propose to have people who are ordinary common criminals, who should be deported, who will be deported and who normally would be deported to Yugoslavia preserved from being returned to Yugoslavia merely by some phoney story that they are men of great principle, although they may be anarchists or terrorists, and that they will be in some peril if they are deported to Yugoslavia. This matter requires a lot of investigation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sogorovic</inline> &#39;s case is still undergoing investigation. If he would genuinely be in any peril by being deported to Yugoslavia and we are satisfied of that, he will not be deported to Yugoslavia; neither will any other Croatian in a similar position. </para>

          <para>- I intervene in the debate only to support strongly the stance which the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator James McClelland)</inline> has taken. I do not say that idly. Like the Minister, during the 10 years that I have been a member of the Senate I think I have attended more than my share of Yugoslav functions. Possibly unlike other senators, I have been involved with violence in the front line- not of my making. So I think I am one who can gauge the atmosphere. During the last 3 years, whichever group has been holding a Yugoslav function there has been none of the gate crashing that was a feature of such functions during the last 5 years or more of the term of office of the previous Government. Let me be quite clear about it. No matter whether people have a Chetnik, a Stash or a white guard i st background, or the background of the vast majority of Yugoslavs who are not involved, they should have freedom of assembly. Virtually all the oppression has come from people of the far Right. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I think that statement was borne out, as some members of the Senate would know, when that famous Senate Select Committee on the Civil Rights of Migrant Australians was appointed. At one of its meetings I asked the representatives of the Commonwealth Police, the Australian Capital Territory Police and the New South Wales Police whether they could give me details of any acts of aggression by members of what would be termed the left wing element of the Greek community against their diplomatic representatives, comparable with what was done against Yugoslav consulates and embassies. They could not give me any. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> also would recall that last year I had the pleasure of sitting on an Estimates committee of which he was a member. I asked representatives of the Commonwealth Police and the Australian Capital Territory Police whether we should remove our guards from the Yugoslav Embassy in Canberra. The answer was an emphatic no. </para>
        <para>I take this matter a little further. All of us want world peace. In the Balkans in the not far distant future the present ruler could well pass on. He is in his 80s now. Some misguided people in Australia, some of this minute element of the Croats, may want to go there and be involved in some internal wrangle which could jeopardise world peace. I do not say those words idly. An illustrious senator in the Opposition ranks, none other than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> on one memorable occasion, as spokesman for the then Foreign Minister, said that any attempt to upset, dismantle or fragment Yugoslavia would affect the power structure or the power balance between the NATO and the Warsaw powers. Nobody wants that. This Government says that it will not tolerate people going there as a sort of <inline font-style="italic">agent provocateur</inline> and then flashing an Australian passport. </para>
        <para>It is not my place to give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> a lecture or a sermon, but I believe that no matter where people come from they cannot use Australia as a launching pad for trouble making. The vast bulk of the Yugoslav community feels that these days they are singularly free of incidents. It will do Victorian senators good to hear this: I was at the Yugoslav-Australian tenth anniversary function at Chatswood, which is in the heart of our north side. There are still votes for Australian Labor Party senators there. But the point was that there were some Croats there from Clifton Hill. When I explained our attitude on pension portability and ethnic radio they said: We realise that we have listened too long to ex-Senator Hannan&#39;. That was the nicest tribute this Labor Government ever got. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> has heard that said also. </para>
        <para>My illustrious colleague, the Minister for Labor and Immigration, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, referred to the Serbians. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has every right to raise complaints about what I call a minute section of the Croatian community. However, there are other serpents in the garden- I use that term deliberately- among the Slovenes who are pretty highly regarded law abiding people. Two men by the names of Vladimir Men art and Ljemka Bantick have laid low for a number of years, but these two men have resurrected a newspaper in which they make attacks on people. I get something for my corner, but I have been threatened before today. I do not mind that so much. They have the effrontery to illustrate their newspaper with the actions of White Guardians who were equivalent to the Chetniks and the Stash in being allied to the Nazi forces. They imply that any Slovene who does not buy their magazine is not patriotic. Many of the people who do not buy it are men who did not serve in World War II but who got Australian citizenship in the 1954-59 period and were called up as national servicemen. That is the sort of atmosphere that this Government has tried to cool down. </para>
        <para>I conclude on another matter. Two Croats came to see me. One is an aeronautical engineer. He wants to go to Chicago and work for some American firm. I told him that I was prepared to go to both the Minister for Foreign Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> and also the Minister for Labor and Immigration, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland. I said to him: &#39;Look, I am not that naive. If you go to Chicago will you give me an assurance that you are not going to attend any of those Croatian brotherhood meetings which bring out those blood curdling manifestos about what is going to happen when Marshal Tito passes on and about how they are going to get even with people. That is not my idea of modern society&#39;. He said: <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator, I</inline> am not prepared to give you that assurance &#39;. If that man wanted to further his career as an aeronautical engineer by going to Chicago, we would be wrong in denying him permission to go overseas. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland said, it is obvious that he is like the infamous Seiko Rover; he has something to hide. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline>has raised the point of our being involved with countries which have left wing governments. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> should not forget that we inherited another nettle which succeeding Ministers for Foreign Affairs have found difficult to overcome. I went to the Aust care seminar on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland. I had to stand up there and tell people from certain Christian sects of the Middle East that because we cannot get police clearance on some of their relatives they have the odium of being linked with groups associated with the Palestine Liberation Organisation. We have had to err on the side of security. I know that people like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> have very strong views about our attitude towards the Middle East. Some of my views coincide with those of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume.</inline> But where would this Government be if we did not have a firm hand and insist on proper security clearances. The point of my argument is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland is taking a rigid line so that we do not export trouble shooters. We are as vigilant about the Middle East as is the Opposition. To be quite honest, it is a very agonising decision to have to take. I know that governments of the persuasion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> have been divided about on which side they should err, and so are we. All I say is that we are practising the virtue of consistency. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill declares the rates of income tax payable for the 1975-76 financial year. There are 3 main features covered by the Bill: A new personal tax scale; reduced rates of company tax; and the removal of the surcharge of tax on property income. I will, discuss each of these features in turn, but will devote most of my attention to the new personal income tax scheme. Compared with the 1974-75 rates, the new personal income tax scale has higher marginal rates of tax on the first $6,000 of taxable income. In other words, the shape of the progressive tax rate scale has been fundamentally changed in a way that allows an overhaul of the whole personal income tax system. Because of this change in the rate scale, we have been able to make reductions in most of the marginal rates of tax payable higher up the income scale, particularly around the industrially sensitive level of wages near average weekly earnings. The high marginal rates near the average weekly earnings level- 44 per cent and 48 per cent under the 1974-75 scale- have long been causing concern, particularly in the field of industrial relations. They are sharply reduced under the new scale to 35 per cent. We hope and expect that this change will be especially welcome to trade union leaders and the members of their unions. </para>
          <para>Restructuring the scale in this way has also made possible an increase in the value of concessional allowances for dependants thus achieving a highly desirable redistribution of the burden of taxation in favour of the family man. The increases in the value of dependant allowances, together with the proposed general rebate of $540, will, in a great many cases, more than compensate for the effects of the increased rates of tax payable on certain parts of the taxable income. Indeed, as the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> emphasised in his Budget Speech, as a package, the new personal tax system will completely free from tax nearly half a million taxpayers. For a person without dependants, the tax threshold that is, the lowest level at which income tax will have to be paid- will generally be raised from $1,041 in 1974-75 to $2,5 19 in 1975-76. For persons with dependants, the threshold will range from $4,001 where the only dependant is a spouse, to $5,943 where there is a dependant spouse and three children, including two at school. </para>
          <para>Under our new tax system very significant benefits will flow to persons entitled to rebate for dependants. Let me take 2 examples which illustrate the position for gainers and losers. For a taxpayer with a dependant wife and one child who has a net income of $7,000 this year and is entitled to rebates for expenditures equal to 5 per cent of net income, tax will be $770 for 1 975-76 compared with $997 on the same income derived in 1974-75- this is a reduction of 22.8 per cent in his or her income tax. However, for a person with the same income but no dependants, tax will be $1,370 in 1975-76 compared with $1,247 in 1974-75- an increase of 9.9 per cent. Lest this latter example seem harsh, I might mention that by most standards, the taxpayer in the former category would be regarded as needing more assistance than the taxpayer in the latter category. </para>
          <para>The benefits of the new tax system will show up in pay packets after 1 January 1976. The revised rates of tax instalment deductions which come into operation on that date will take into account the changed rates of tax, the general rebate of tax, and the rebates for dependants. Tax cuts on income earned in the current first half of the year will be reflected in tax refunds at the end of the year. Two other matters I should mention are the property tax surcharge and the aged persons rebate. The property tax surcharge which applied for 1 974-75 is not being re-imposed for 1975-76. The special rebate of tax for aged persons which for 1974-75 was a basic amount of $130 is to be terminated. First introduced in 1973-74 as a transitional measure associated with the phasing out of the age pension means test, it had always been intended that it be phased out in due course. The rebate is now, in effect, to be absorbed into the general rebate of $540. Although some aged persons will pay more tax in 1975-76 than they would have paid if the arrangements for 1974-75 had continued, it should be remembered that age pensions are being increased each Spring and Autumn. Further, as from I July 1 976, the age at which pensioners become eligible for means-test-free pensions will be reduced to 69 years. The tax effects for aged persons cannot be properly judged without taking these factors into consideration. </para>
          <para>Apart from the personal income tax provisions, the Bill proposes that for the 1975-76 financial year, the general rates of tax payable by companies in respect of 1974-75 incomes will be 42Vi per cent. This will mean for both public and private companies a reduction of <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> cents per dollar in the rate of tax payable on the whole of their taxable incomes. For co-operative companies and non-profit companies, other than friendly society dispensaries, it will mean a reduction of 2&#189; cents in the rate of tax which they pay on income in excess of $10,000. The rate of tax to be paid on the taxable income of a non-profit company that is a friendly society dispensary will remain at 37V4 per cent. </para>
          <para>The rate of tax payable in respect of the 1975-76 investment income of a superannuation fund that does not invest a specified proportion of its assets in public securities will be reduced to 42 !A per cent, thus preserving the link between the rate of tax to be paid in these cases and that to be paid by mutual life assurance companies. Explanations of technical aspects of the Bill are contained in the memorandum I have had circulated. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>This Bill proposes technical amendments to provisions of the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953-1974 which operate to apply the credit system of relief of double taxation in respect of certain income derived by residents of Australia from countries with which Australia has entered into a double taxation agreement. Those provisions provide that where credit for foreign tax in respect of any income is allowable under the provisions of an agreement, the amount of that credit is generally an amount equal to the lesser of the foreign tax paid and the Australian tax payable on that income. A statutory basis is provided for ascertaining the amount of Australian tax payable on the amount of income concerned. </para>
          <para>It is necessary for these purposes to calculate the average rate of Australian tax payable by the taxpayer. The proposed amendments will alter the basis of this calculation. They are consequential on the amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act substituting rebates of tax for deductions previously allowable for dependants and for most of the other concessional deductions, and on the decision not to re- impose the surcharge of tax on income from property for the 1975-76 financial year. The proposed amendments are explained in the memorandum that has been circulated to honourable senators. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

              <para>-I re-present to the Senate the Loan Bill 1975. As with the Appropriation Bills, which I re-introduced, the Loan Bill is being re-presented in precisely the same form as it was some 8 weeks ago- on 28 August. Nevertheless, I think I should again outline briefly for the information of honourable senators the purposes and nature of this Bill. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In the very first sentence of my second reading speech on 28 August I pointed out that the Bill is a machinery measure. It is a means of meeting the requirements of the 3 fund accounting system operated by Australian Governments virtually since Federation under the provisions of the Audit Act. Put simply, there will be, in the absence of a loan Act or some similar piece of legislation, a prospective deficit in the Consolidated </para>
          <para class="block">Revenue Fund. That Consolidated Revenue deficit, which is part of the overall Budget deficit, must be funded in one way or another. The Loan Bill aims to allow this to be done by permitting the transfer of part of our defence expenditures from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Loan Fund. It would authorise borrowings to finance the defence expenditure so transferred. </para>
          <para>There is nothing mysterious or sinister in this machinery process. Loan Acts, including the Act proposed by this Bill, do not authorise any expenditures over and above those authorised in Appropriation Acts passed by the Parliamentthey simply re-allocate approved defence expenditures between the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the Loan Fund. In drafting loan Bills, it is long established usage, followed by both this Government and Liberal Country Party governments, that defence expenditures are chosen to be transferred to and financed from the Loan Fund. Borrowings for defence purposes are specifically exempted from the provisions of the Financial Agreement relating to control by the Loan Council. The view has been taken, rightly in my estimation, that Loan Council involvement in the detailed financing arrangements of the Australian Government Budget should not be any greater than necessary. </para>
          <para>Loan Acts are far from a new development. They have, for very many years, been used by successive governments as the traditional and simplest method of completing the financing of a deficit which extends over the end of the financial year. In the last 10 years of Liberal-Country Party government Loan Acts were foreshadowed in Budget speeches and statements no fewer than 8 times, and no less than 9 Loan Acts were passed by the Parliament. Given the mechanical, indeed virtually accounting nature of the Bill, it is difficult to understand why it has provoked so much interest and attention by the Opposition parties. The Bill was first introduced into the House of Representatives on 20 August, debated on 27 August and passed the same day. The day before, on 26 August, however, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> announced to the Press that the Opposition would be deferring passage of the Bill in the Senate. Since then the Bill has been debated on 7 separate occasions between 28 August and 15 October in the Senate, 3 separate series of questions leading to the provision, by myself and my colleagues, of 36 detailed answers have appeared. With the Treasurer&#39;s approval, Treasury officials have met with Opposition senators to further explain the reasons for the Bill. Yet we find, even after 8 weeks and a flow of information not previously seen in respect of any other loan Bill, that the Opposition in the Senate has persisted in deferring the Bill. Similar legislation in 1 97 1 with the same type of clause limiting the amount authorised to be transferred, introduced by the then LiberalCountry Party Government took, for example, only a matter of days to pass through all stages in both Houses. </para>
          <para>The information provided on most aspects of this Bill has already been so extensive that I feel little would be achieved by again going over all of the ground so far traversed. One aspect, however, needs to be covered to make it clear to the Senate why the Bill is being re-introduced now. The Opposition has argued to the effect that this Bill would permit unlimited borrowing. Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed anyone reading the Bill properly should know that. The form of limitations used in the Bill now before the Senate was first used in 1968 and similar limitation clauses were used again in 1970 and 1971. There is no basis on which it could be implied now that there is something sinister about these clauses. However, since they are apparently not understood, I will explain in simple terms. </para>
          <para>Even though clause 3 does not state a specific amount, there are two very important limitations upon the amount which can be borrowed and utilised under the Bill when it is enacted. First, the borrowing authority is limited to the extent of the anticipated deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Secondly, and more importantly in the current context, the amounts borrowed can be utilised only to finance defence expenditures incurred after the passage of the Bill into law. Such defence expenditures must, at the same time, have been approved by Parliament under other Acts which are mentioned in the Bill or expressed by Parliament to be subject to the Loan Act. Once defence expenditure has already been charged to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, this Bill will not authorise its subsequent transfer to Loan Fund. The delay in its passage must, therefore, substantially affect the scope for this necessary piece of accounting. Out of a potential total of* $ 1 ,7 1 1 m expenditure under the heading &#39;Department of Defence&#39; close to $500m has been charged to the Consolidated Revenue Fund already and that amount, of course, increases as the days go by. </para>
          <para>It may be that the notion that delaying this measure will somehow hasten the point at which the Government runs out of money is still abroad. There is no question of the Government running out of money. What the Loan Bill is, and Loan Acts have always been, designed to do is to provide authority to complete the financing of a prospective deficit over the financial year as a whole. Refusal to pass the Loan Bill does not, of itself, therefore, prevent any expenditures being made. It simply means that some other less appropriate way of financing the Consolidated Revenue Fund deficit will be forced upon the Government at some future date. The delay which has so far taken place with this machinery Bill may already have pushed us to the stage where further legislation may be required to clear the Consolidated Revenue Fund deficit at the end of the year. Obviously, however, the smaller any recourse to such alternatives has to be, the less unorthodox and confusing would be the measures then forced on the Government. </para>
          <para>Purely from a legislative point of view, the delays occasioned on the passage of this Bill in the Senate could result in a requirement for an amendment to be made to it before it completes its passage through the Parliament. The Bill was drafted on the assumption that it would receive royal assent before Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and would need to be amended to be appropriate if Appropriation Bill (No. 1 ) were to be getting royal assent first. To sum up, when the Bill was first introduced it was an urgent machinery matter. It remains so. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- The Opposition does not oppose the second reading of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill. In effect, the Bill makes consequential changes to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act, following upon the announcement by the Government that a new Director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization will be appointed. The new Director is to be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward who will take office, according to announcements made, at the end of November. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward is and has been a judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court since 1972. He will continue to hold an appointment as a judge of that Court. He is also the  Chairman  of the Trade Practices Tribunal. One of the changes which the Bill makes is to ensure that the salary which he receives is the salary which is payable to him as the  Chairman  of that Tribunal. Essentially, what the Bill does is to ensure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward&#39;s, position as a judge, although he is not named personally in the Bill, is preserved notwithstanding that he holds the office of Director of the Organization. One of the other consequential changes is, of course, that the title  Director-General &#39;is to be changed to &#39;Director&#39;. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Bill therefore is essentially a formal Bill. But there are some matters to which 1 address myself and to which the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> may be prepared to give a response in the course of his reply. The first is the absence of any information from the Government as to the circumstances in which these changes are taking place and the purposes behind the changes which the allied measure relating to the interception of telephone communications is designed to achieve. There has been a great deal of speculation ever since the sudden announcement that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbour</inline> would cease to be the Director-General of ASIO and that a successor would be appointed. Whilst there is always a degree of delicacy attaching to matters relating to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, periodically when a change takes place in the leadership of that Organisation it is appropriate that there should be some announcement as to why the change has taken place. </para>
          <para>I think we all are aware that there have been commissions of inquiry into the functioning of security organisations overseas in recent years. In England I think it was originally the Radcliffe Commission followed by the Denying Commission. In Canada also there was a royal commission into the security services. The clear recommendation of each of those commissions was that the responsibility for the security service should be in t he hands of a designated Minister. I think that in Great Britain the designated Minister was the Home Secretary and that in Canada the designated Minister was the Solicitor-General. But the purpose of those recommendations, as I understand the reports, is to ensure that a Minister other than the Prime Minister has the responsibility of answering for the functioning of the organisation and has a responsibility for the overall administration of the service and yet those functions are to be performed without denying to the head of the security service the right of access at all times to the Prime Minister of the day. It seems that some such functioning ought to be the way in which the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation is conducted. </para>
          <para>I have not any doubt in my mind that much of the misconception that is abroad with regard to the functioning of our security service stems from a lack of appreciation of what a security service is designed to achieve and the way in which it must carry out its duties. If there were a greater understanding I think it would be recognised that the right of access to the relevant Minister or Ministers from time to time is the important consideration. I think it was the Denying Commission in England which stated that the best way of conducting a security organisation was to appoint at the head of the organisation a man whom you could trust and to ensure that you trusted him. The reason for that, I am sure, is that security is a matter of obtaining information, of assessing and evaluating the information which is obtained and of passing on to the persons who have the responsibility for decision making the best intelligence that is available relating to the security of the nation. </para>
          <para>In the course of obtaining and evaluating the information it would be necessary- as it always has been- for gossip, scandal and rumour to be collected and collated and for the relevant information to be obtained from the sifting process which must be engaged in. It ought not to be the right of a Minister of the day, even a Prime Minister, to delve into the records of a security organisation for the purpose of muck raking or for the purpose of extracting from the files any gossip or rumour which might be misused or which might be open to the accusation or suggestion that it could be misused. The important consideration is to ensure that as far as possible there is a safeguarding of the security files and security information and that the persons who have the responsibility for safeguarding and for evaluating the information are persons in whom there can be placed a bi-partisan trust. It is tremendously important for the functioning of a security service that that trust can be demonstrated and held. </para>
          <para>I believe that those who have held the office of Director-General- there have been 3 persons over the 27 years since the organisation was first established by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chifley-</inline> are persons who ought to have had the trust of the Australian nation. I think it is regrettable that a partisan approach has obscured from time to time the real service which the organisation must perform and that same partisan approach has prevented due acknowledgement being given and to some extent has weakened public acceptance of the organisation. I think that the present Government when it was in Opposition nourished a completely unreasonable fear and apprehension of the work of the Security Organization. I believe that that fear was shown to be sustained when the responsibility of government placed the available information and the available knowledge in the hands of the present Government. </para>

              <para>- I wonder how much difference there was. One significant difference was the publicised intrusion of a former Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> into the affairs of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. I am sure that that weakened the morale of the officers of the service and aroused doubts and apprehensions as to how far they were appreciated by the government of the day. I suggest that before that intrusion occurred there was no verification of the apprehensions which had been felt beforehand. But I speak only as to the future. I do not know what the future of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation will be. We certainly wish <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward every satisfaction in the discharge of his duties. He is known to many people on both sides of the chamber as a person whose integrity is unquestioned and whose dedication to serving the interests of the country is not open to question. I am sure that he embarks in an area in which he has little knowledge. I only hope that for his and for the nation&#39;s benefit he will derive satisfaction in the discharge of his duties. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I raise a final matter hoping that the Minister might explain the situation. I notice that he has no advisers here. As I understand the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation legislation there is no provision for the appointment of an acting director of the Organisation. I understand that the present director of the Organisation has ceased to perform the functions of director general and that the new appointee, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, is not to take office until some time towards the end of November. Other statutory functions are vested in the director-general of ASIO or, as the position will become, the director of ASIO. As I understand it there is no provision for these functions to be performed by an acting director. I wonder whether the Minister will advert to that aspect in the course of his reply. </para>
          <para>The Opposition recognises that the administrative arrangements which underlie this legislation are determined by the government of the day. Previously, both under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chifley</inline> and under the various Liberal-Country Party administrations, the administrative responsibility for the conduct of ASIO was vested in the Attorney-General. Following the pattern in other countries the head of ASIO always had access, whenever he wanted it, to the Prime Minister of the day. The present Government, without explanation, is changing the administrative arrangements so that in all respects ASIO is now the responsibility of the Prime Minister and of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. Information might be given to the Parliament as to why that change took place. I invite the Leader of the Government in the Senate to do so. </para>

            <para>- I support the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill. I felt it was a change to hear from the former Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> rather temperate utterances on this important matter. As one who has figured at various times on Australian Labor Party policy committees which have dealt with this matter I assure him that I have never had any inhibitions about the justification for an effective security organisation. Every type of government in the world needs it. But the question is: After receiving material, how does the Government use it? I feel that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has a remarkably short memory when he talks about the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation being used for trivial and party political advantage. That may have been an error. I recall on one occasion here a heated debate on Vietnam. Some woman pacifist from the northern suburbs of Sydney had a son who did not want to join the local cadet corps. It finally transpired that we got this information through ASIO. It was not said directly that ASIO got the information, but obviously there was an evaluation. That is the sort of thing that we do not want to happen again. </para>

          <para>I do not want to go over the ashes of the past but I think the point <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> made, and we are entitled to discuss it, concerned the roles of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. To some degree there is a comparison here with Great Britain and the role of its Home Secretary. I have discussed this matter on a number of occasions with the Honourable James Callaghan whom I knew when he was just an obscure backbencher in the British Labor Party. This is an extremely difficult matter because sometimes security evaluations must overlap into the portfolio of the Foreign Minister. I would rather paint a broader picture. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and everyone will agree with me that in the United States of America unfortunately there has been a proliferation of security agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency there are one or two others- and these agencies have been competing with one another. The result there is that their credibility seems to have gone by the board. </para>
          <para>What is this Government&#39;s grand design? On the one hand we propose to consolidate the Australian Capital Territory Police Force and the Australia Police into one unit, and then ASIO would have its proper function of evaluation. I would say then that when problems concerning terrorist crime arise there would be a feedback from ASIO to the Australia Police and down to the State police. This would make this operation much more efficient than it is now. I do not say that idly. It just happens that less than an hour ago in an earlier debate I referred to the education which honourable senators got when they sat on the Senate Select Committee on the Civil Rights of Migrant Australians. Those of us on the Committee questioned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbour.</inline> I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> would agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon, Senator James</inline> McClelland and I who felt that it was a very good exercise. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbour</inline> did not deny then that his facilities in terms of competent interpreters and translators were inadequate and that they were necessary to one area where ASIO had a role to play. I would say that since that time- one finds out these things and notes the results- some of the inadequacies of ASIO have been improved. ASIO does not have an easy role. </para>
          <para>It may be said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> feels at times that we are unduly disrespectful of certain super powers, but we could say the same about his attitude to another super power. Obviously I would not like to see ASIO tailor its reports to suit the Government of the day, but I believe that the cold war hang-ups we have had have upset some of ASIO&#39;s evaluations. I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is here because he would know what came through loud and clear on the Croatian issue. There were Foreign Affairs people suggesting to Prime Minister Whitlam and the Attorney-General what should be done in respect of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the Warsaw Pact and Yugoslavia. Before we became the Government <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> in one of the best speeches he has made admitted that to me after he had been briefed by the Department of Foreign Affairs. I do not want to harp on that theme but I am trying to get through to the Senate the difficult job which ASIO has. I do not imagine that at any time ASIO will ever be perfect. I refer honourable senators to the problems at the moment of West Germany. The social democratic government was in trouble and there was a fishing expedition like the ones conducted here by the Opposition. The result was that when Will i Brandt left office the social democrats remained in government. </para>
          <para>From the reports that have appeared in certain magazines it is clear that even though there are political and security evaluations, people who are subversive do get through. I am not one of those who believe that under this Government or the alternative government every ASIO evaluation is going to be 100 per cent, but we have beefed up the Organisation. We have modernised it. We have it geared to a situation in which it has better interpreter facilities. I will not mention the word &#39;telex&#39; because it is a dirty word at the moment. There is a more efficient organisation. But the more I listen to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and my colleagues speak about security generally the more I believe that at times one has to see the individual concerned rather than take for granted what is contained in an ASIO report. I am thinking of what happens with citizenship applications. As honourable senators know, I told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope at my in camera interview with him that I believed in the Canadian system of reviewing citizenship rejections whereby in a 9-man panel any five members constitute an appeals board, one-third of the members are legal people and another third are a blending of representatives of trade unions, manufacturers and other kindred groups. </para>
          <para>I believe that it is a welcome move to put ASIO under the responsibility of the Prime Minister. We must act then, in a large enough case, in concert with the Minister for Police and Customs, the Minister for Labor and Immigration and the Attorney-General. Security can be so explosive. I use the Will i Brandt case as an example. A Prime Minister&#39;s head rolled on that occasion. I think that our Prime Minister should have his hand on the throttle to see that things do not go wrong. </para>
          <para class="block">We can learn lessons from other countries. I am not speaking out of school in saying that in a conversation I had with our illustrious Prime Minister I asked whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodhouse &#39;s appointment would mean that he would be deaf to any reforms that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope may suggest and he told me emphatically no. </para>
          <para>So, as I see it, we will have a consolidation of the Australian and Australian Capital Territory police forces and a beefed up, modernised ASIO with the emphasis on national security and not on any petty keyhole prying to find out trivial things out of which someone might get a short term party political advantage. The Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt),</inline> knows that if any further adjustments have to be made to ASIO after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope has brought down his report, which I think will be a monumental one, I will be the first one to raise those matters in this chamber. </para>

            <para>- in reply- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> raised 2 matters on which I should comment. The first concerns the provision for an Acting Director. I am not able to answer that question, which appears to me to be a legitimate one. I can only suggest that I obtain a comment from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> on that point. The second point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> raised in the last part of his speech was, as I understand it, the reason for the transfer of responsibility to the Prime Minister from the Attorney-General. It is well known that over the years ASIO has been very much under the influence of the Prime Ministers of the day, even though the administrative responsibility has been with the Attorney-General. I have in front of me some statements by three previous Prime Ministers- Chifley, Menzies and Holt- which I think are worth quoting. On 10 March 1949, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chifley</inline> said: </para>

            <para>- I  raise the point to which 1 adverted briefly in the course of the second reading debate and to which the Minister for Minerals and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> has referred; that is, the absence of any provision with regard to the appointment of an acting director. I am relying upon newspaper reports for the concern which I have. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbour</inline> ceased to be Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation almost from the time that the announcement of the change was made. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward will not take up his duties as director until he has completed some judicial duties on which he is currently engaged. It may be- I am not aware of this-that he is currently holding the position of director and therefore there is a function which he is able to perform. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>On the other hand, I have some recollection- it may be only an impression- that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mahony,</inline> as  Deputy  Secretary of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, is currently acting as director-general of ASIO. I wonder at the authority of an acting director-general to perform the functions which the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act, in particular, requires. I would have thought that a reading of the legislation would show that an acting director, not being a position created by the ASIO Act, is not empowered to perform functions which another Act vests in the director general of ASIO. On the other hand, it may be that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mahony</inline> has been appointed director of ASIO and that my concern is not really jermaine to any issue. However, I feel that the Committee would be letting a matter pass without due regard to the seriousness of the powers granted by the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act if it were to allow the question to remain unanswered. </para>
          <para>I wonder, in those circumstances, whether the Minister would be prepared to stand over this matter, if we are to go into the other matters, so that the position can be clarified. It is a suggestion made to assist. It may be, as I have said, that the point is not one which on examination has any substance. If it does have substance on the other hand, I imagine that it is a matter which could be rectified very simply, and generally with approval. </para>

          <para>The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is correct that, under the reformed system of income tax, concessions previously allowed as deductions (other than those relating to gifts and home loan interest) will be converted to rebates and that the amounts of income on which tax is calculated first up will be higher than under the old system. But after applying the rate scale to the income, the tax so calculated will now be reduced by the amount of the concessional rebates whereas previously there was no such reduction. Every taxpayer is entitled to a basic rebate of $340. The rebates for maintenance of dependants have an effective worth considerably greater than the old deductions, even for a taxpayer on the highest marginal rate under the old system: $400 as against $244 in the case, for example, of a wholly dependant wife. Also the rebate for items other than dependants increases above $340 if allowable expenditures exceed $ 1,350- it will then be worth 40 per cent of the expenditures, whereas the deductions would have been worth less than that for many people. </para>
            <para>It by no means follows, therefore, that the amount of tax actually payable will be higher. Concessional allowances have not been withdrawn- they have been changed from deductions to rebates and are brought into the calculation of tax at a later stage. </para>
