          <para class="block">The motion that I have moved is in line with the practice which has been adopted by Senate committees in the past when people have sought to be represented by legal counsel. In moving the motion I emphasise that the Government does not acknowledge that the calling of citizens to the Bar of the Senate is a proper procedure in matters of this nature. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> said last week, the decision to bring <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> before the Bar of the Senate is the responsibility, and must remain the responsibility, of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> and the Opposition. The Government does not believe that this place is a court of law, but because the witness has been brought here by the combined Opposition we want to ensure that he is given maximum protection as an Australian citizen. It is for that reason that I have moved the motion. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition will not oppose the motion. I am somewhat surprised that in moving a simple formal motion like the one before us the Special Minister of State <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland)</inline> should indulge in political activity. The fact that the motion has been moved in these terms arises out of the fact that the witness sent a telegram to the Senate last week. I thought as a result of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> said and what I said on that occasion it was resolved, without any sort of fuss and bother, without anybody trying to score political points, that the witness ought to be allowed to have counsel to advise him. I thought there was never any doubt as to how we would regard that matter. For the Minister now to indulge in the exercise in which he has indulged, I think, does nothing to further the protection of witnesses. </para>

            <para>- I wish to express a word of caution. My experience in working on committees- this has been explained by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland- has been that the witness has the right to bring counsel and the witness has the right to refer to counsel but that the judgment is still left with the witness. I trust that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> will permit the counsel to caution the witness if counsel feels that the witness is entering into an area which may prejudice him. </para>

          <para>I know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and have acted as an agent for him in his efforts to raise a loan for the Australian Government. I have been in touch with him many times by telephone, by telex and personally both in Australia and overseas. </para>
          <para>I was first introduced to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> some time either in late October or early November last year. I then introduced him to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron</inline>has been a friend of mine for many years and I had told him in September last year that I had heard that large amounts of funds were available overseas at low interest rates. He told me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> could be interested, and then he introduced me to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor.</inline></para>
          <para>Since I first met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> I have been in touch with him on many occasions in relation to this matter and also for many other business deals. We are still doing business together. </para>
          <para>I have never had any contact with the lenders of the money. This has been handled only by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline></para>
          <para>I have never asked for or been offered any payment or commission by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> or any of his officers. In fact I have been told specifically by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> on more than one occasion that any payment of fees must be from the lender&#39;s side and not from the Government side. </para>
          <para>I expected to receive some payment for my efforts and trusted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> to arrange this. I do not know how much I would have received if the deal had been finalised. </para>
          <para>I am the &#39;Adelaide connection&#39; referred to in some of the documents passed between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> I have visited <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> on many occasions and telephoned him either to pass on messages from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> or to advise progress or obtain further information, and he has given me copies of some telexes. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline>produced draft documents to a meeting of Government officers from various departments early in December last year. This was in Sydney and I was at the meeting. I think I have all these drafts but I am not sure. The drafts were not acceptable to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> and after this it was clear that any payments for commission and other charges had to be taken out at the lender&#39;s end. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> had a lot of trouble finalising or attempting to finalise the arrangements for commission. I believe it was never finalised. </para>
          <para>I was never given a copy of the Executive Council minute which I have now seen in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I think a copy was given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline></para>
          <para>I have copies of some of the documents which have been tabled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> but not all of them. I received lots of messages from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> on my telex machine, but most of these were not kept. I do have some, however, and these are available. Most are progress reports. I have copies of some messages sent by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> which were sent to me on my telex. I discussed with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> other matters which are not relevant. </para>
          <para>I always hoped to receive some form of payment for my services. </para>
          <para>Pursuant to the summons issued to me on 17 July I produce all relevant documents in my possession. </para>

It was not without thought that I asked that question, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> &#39;s continuing business relationships with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> may have some bearing on the major aspect of loan negotiations. I do not want, for any personal or prying reasons, to know of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> &#39;s future ventures in that regard. But 1 do think it would be useful to have the information which was half ventured by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> himself in the incomplete form in his statement which all honourable senators have. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I address you on the point of order on that basis. </para>

I would suggest that it is credible to think that he would know all of the various effects, both private and Government, which he could get to know which would affect the future of these negotiations which he was managing in his quarter in Adelaide. I would suggest that it is not unreasonable at least to ask him and to allow him to reply if he does not know. </para>

He asked the question in a general way and received a general answer. People hearing that answer could be pardoned for believing that the answer was given in a general sense rather than within the knowledge of the witness. The question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> is now proposing to pose to the witness flows from that general concept of a general answer rather than an answer given within the knowledge of the witness himself. </para>

If counsel in a court of law were to cross-examine a witness and having been met with a denial were then to turn to the judge and say &#39;There you are Your Honour, we know that is untrue&#39; he would be sat down very abruptly. I suggest that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> gets an answer that does not suit him he should not die be allowed to suggest to the Senate at large that the witness is obviously lying. This is a breach of this man&#39;s legal rights and privileges and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> should not be allowed to pursue this matter further merely because he has not got the answers that he wanted. </para>

He asked whether the practice would be followed, which was followed in Senate committees, of counsel or legal advisers referring to the witness and making approaches to them when questions of some difficulty were asked. This was a practice which was followed in most sensitive inquiries conducted by the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I submit to you that if on issues as sensitive as that this practice was followed by the </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir MAGNUS</inline>CORMACKSpeaking to the point of order, I point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> has made the assertion that the practice followed by the Securities and Exchange Committee was that a witness could consult his lawyer. That is perfectly true. But he could consult his lawyer only when given permission by the  Chairman.  The witness would address himself to the  Chairman  and say, &#39;I would like to consult my lawyer&#39;. If permission was granted he then consulted his lawyer. But that is not the case here. The practice has been, on all committees on which I have had any experience as a member or  chairman,  that a witness before the committee is entitled to ask a  chairman  whether he might consult his counsel. In this instance, with the Senate sitting as a whole at the present moment, it is the witness&#39;s duty when in doubt as to how he should answer and whether he could be put in prejudice to address himself to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and then you can give him permission to consult his counsel. </para>

              <para>-Yes, it is a point of order. I sounded a word of caution when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland proposed the rules about legal counsel. My experience on the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange is as long as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack. I recall numerous instances where legal counsel was aware that his client was not able to answer the question in a manner which would not be of prejudice to him. The  Chairman  on all occasions, and members of that Committee, used the discretion in favour of the witness. At all times the Committee endeavoured to protect the rights of the witness and, in some way, to ignore the interpretation which honourable senators opposite are now trying to place upon the proceedings of committees. It was for that reason that I raised the point of order. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I believe that you have ruled in the interests of this witness and of the counsel who represents him here today. I think it would be a gross injustice to this witness, particularly since he has some difficulty in understanding- although his answers have been prompt and clear- if counsel were not able to indicate to the witness that he ought to exercise some caution, especially since the questioning is becoming most legalistic. </para>

              <para>asked the witness whether he was aware that he had been asked in the summons to produce all documents in his custody, care or control. When the witness was asked that question <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> responded with the answer: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> may I consult my counsel?&#39;.

Mr President,</inline> I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> &#39;s point of order is not taken against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> &#39;s answer whereby <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> asked you whether he should be allowed to consult his counsel. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> is not questioning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> but, indeed, querying the integrity of a person who is of the same profession as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen.</inline> I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> &#39;s remarks were completely disallowable, and I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> should be allowed to proceed to consult his counsel. </para>

              <para>- Very briefly, as an ordinary layman not recognising the refinements of legal procedures, I suggest that the very purpose that the Senate gave its permission for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> to be accompanied by legal counsel was so that counsel could help him in the manner in which he is now being assisted. We gave him that authority to have legal help. If he has got a legal adviser sitting beside him who recognises that there could be some difficulties, traps or pitfalls, then it is the obligation and the responsibility of his legal adviser to tell him of those things, and that is the authority which we gave, I suggest. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> quite properly raised this matter right at the outset. I had it in my mind to do the same thing. I thought that right at the outset we cleared up the whole point that if, in fact, it became apparent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis&#39;s</inline> legal adviser that there could be some trap or some pitfall in the question then the legal adviser should draw that to the attention of the person who may be regarded as his client. That is what we are about, surely. If he cannot give legal advice, then we have fooled <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> right from the beginning of this inquisition. </para>

              <para>- On the point of order, when my attention was drawn to the method of consultation between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> and his counsel I read out the instructions that the Senate had drawn up. They state that if a witness wishes to consult his counsel as to his legal rights on any question asked of him he shall apply to the  President  for permission to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> said that the counsel of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> was pointing to a document. No qualification was made as to the method of consultation. My interpretation of consultation would be discussion, seeking advice, seeking guidance, exchanging views, or interpretation. I have applied a wide interpretation to the method of consultation in order to assist <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> not only because of possible language difficulties but also because of the rather overawing situation in which he finds himself in the Senate. I think that his seeking advice from his counsel is quite in order. If there are no further questions to be asked - </para>

I am asking you, because you have sworn in your answer that they were your words and not your lawyer&#39;s words, why you chose only to say that you produced the documents in your possession.

              <para>- It will be sufficient to move that the honourable senator&#39;s time for questioning be extended. But I would like to remind the Senate that these are the rules I have to interpret here: Rule 8 provides that the first Government senator and the first Opposition senator to ask questions of a witness shall not be limited in time; other senators may question a witness for not more than 15 minutes, unless otherwise ordered. Rule 9 provides that no senator, having questioned a witness in accordance with these rules, shall question a witness a second time, unless by leave of the Senate. If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to move for an extension of the time of the honourable senator he is quite at liberty to do so. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>I daresay that it was inevitable that this situation would arise. When the rules were originally brought down- the Opposition&#39;s rules- I indicated that the Government would have no part in the draw ing up of any rules because we opposed the whole exercise in which the Senate is now involved. It was clearly intended in those rules that the first  speaker  on either side would have unlimited time. In this particular circumstance, quite properly the first  speaker  was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall. It was as a result of his motion that the witness was called here. He, occupying the position of first  speaker  on the Opposition side, was given unlimited time. Strictly speaking, the rules should have referred to non-governmental senators. However, the intention was quite clear. The rest of the rules provide that any subsequent  speaker  must obtain leave of the Senate for an extension of time. Again this was clearly the intention of the rules. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> either we observe the rules strictly and you rule that leave must be obtained or, as you have indicated, there is only one other course open to the Leader of the Opposition, and he should move accordingly. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>I do not wish to delay the members of the Senate for any length of time. This is the first and only time that I have ever spoken on the adjournment, and I do so to rectify what I regard as a serious injustice, having given an opportunity for that injustice to be rectified by one of the honourable senators opposite. My attention was drawn to the adjournment debate, as reported in the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of last Wednesday, 16 July, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> spoke about a matter which affected my staff. He raised the matter without extending the traditional courtesy of letting me know that he would do so, and I think that everybody will regret that. I do not wish to pitch this in high key. The substance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> &#39;s speech was a complaint that his staff had been obstructed by my secretary in an over-assertive and authoritative way, using my supposed rank as a shadow Minister to obtain privileges for herself and thereby interrupting the course of some work. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> then incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a letter which he had written in extravagant and indeed hysterical terms to the relevant Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly.</inline> I myself think that a matter concerning a person who is not a member of this Senate and who cannot defend herself ought not to have been ventilated in that way without in the first place referring it to me- without in the first place making inquiries. </para>

          <para>Having said that, I indicate that the circumstances are that every person who was present, including the 2 Commonwealth employees and the person who was operating the photostat machine, have made statements- and unqualified statements- saying that the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> is totally false, totally untrue, in fact could not be more so. I rise to say this: I gave <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> the opportunity to avoid the necessity of my getting to my feet It is fair to say to the Senate that I communicated with him. I now ask leave of the Senate to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> my own correspondence to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly</inline> and to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill.</inline> Leave was given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> in incorporate a document in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

          <para>You did not see fit, in spite of a long-standing parliamentary convention, to notify me of your intention to make such allegations. </para>
          <para>These allegations are wholly untrue. I have established that fact by exhaustive inquiries not only of my secretary but also of the two Commonwealth employees who were present. </para>
          <para>My secretary sought no preferment either on that or any other occasion. She entered the copying room, saw that it was occupied, said &#39;Excuse me, I didn&#39;t know there was anyone here. I will wait &#39;till you&#39;ve finished&#39; and took a seat outside, without any further attempt to intervene. </para>
          <para>A Commonwealth employee, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bill</inline> Ingliss, confirms this and says that, entirely on his own volition, he entered the copying room and suggested to the man there <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr O&#39;Brien)</inline> that he might agree to allow a brief job to be done. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingliss</inline> informs me that this was his normal procedure and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr O&#39;Brien</inline> agreed readily saying: &#39;Seeing its you, Bill, yes &#39;. </para>
          <para>My secretary then ran off some six copies of a letter involving two or three minutes of elapsed time. </para>
          <para>This sequence of events is also confirmed by another employee, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs C.</inline> Molineaux, who was present throughout the incident. </para>
          <para>NeitherI nor my secretary has ever asserted any right on my part to preferential treatment for any reason including status as a Shadow Minister. I have always recognised and defended the equal rights of all my colleagues. </para>

              <para>-I thank the Senate. I wish to say that, upon the absolute statement of the 2 Commonwealth employees and the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr O&#39;Brien</inline> who was alleged to have been obstructed, my secretary never at any time sought to assert priority in undertaking her work. The contrary is the case. The employees concerned said that they heard her say: &#39;I am sorry, I did not know you were there. I will withdraw and wait my turn&#39;. That, in fact, is said by all. The <inline font-weight="bold">Mr O&#39;Brien</inline> who was interrupted sought me out yesterday in the presence of five of my colleagues to tell me how ashamed he was that such an attack should have been made. What I should like is for the opportunity to be given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> to rectify this matter in relation to the girl concerned. The remarks which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> made regarding myself happen to be totally untrue but I am fair game; he can attack me any time he likes. </para>

          <para>I wish that this had never happened. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> and I have had some pretty good relationships over the years. He had a first class opportunity as an honourable senator to rectify this matter without the necessity for me to make a speech at all. He did not do so. If he feels frustrated that something has happened to him incidental to his getting some work done, that is a matter for him to take up with the Commonwealth employees concerned. He should not pick on innocent people. I say to honourable senators without qualification that the incident as stated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard is</inline> totally invented. It is totally despicable that this should be done. Having said this, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I do hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> will withdraw his allegations. </para>

Incidentally, whilst I did have a slap at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> and his staff I was equally caustic to the Minister for the Media <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Cass)</inline> to whom I have written. I have also phoned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Spigelman,</inline> the Secretary of the Department of the Media. The Committee for which my secretary had undertaken this assignment is a bi-partisan committee- it includes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> and myself. </para>
          <para>I will play second fiddle to no man. My secretary started a job which disrupted my office and which she was doing for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr O&#39;Brien</inline> and other people. She had a job to complete. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> says that his secretary did not exert any undue pressure. The fact of the matter is that his secretary could have adopted the course that I and my staff adopt and said: &#39;We will come back tomorrow because it is a pretty big job that you are doing&#39;. In the letters that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> is having incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> he refers to a brief operation&#39;. One operation was on quarto size paper and the other on A4-size paper. No matter what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> says about regretting anything, the plain fact is that he got his priority service. I have never sought priority service and have never got it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr O&#39;Brien</inline> came to me and asked my secretary to do a job and not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> &#39;s secretary, it should have been completed without interruption. I stand by that and say again, with respect to everybody, that my prime job was to ensure that my secretary was not treated as an industrial chattel. Nobody, not even the media people, had anything to say to the effect of: <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator, your</inline> office routine has been disrupted; your staff should have been allowed to complete its work&#39;. Whatever heartburning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> has had, I have been equally caustic in my comments about Ministers in relation to this matter. It was standard practice for one job to be completed. I admire <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> &#39;s loyalty to his secretary, but my secretary has rights too. Nobody asked her whether the disruption of her work meant anything, and this is the point. As I saw it, we were entitled to complete the job. If I hit hard, it is because I know <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick&#39;s</inline> attitude. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> wants to argue and lecture on the conduct of staff, he should look at the attitude of his secretary when his car is not waiting for him. She has been pretty tough in that respect. I admire her loyalty to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> but my secretary will not be treated as though she were second class. It will take a bigger man than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> to dictate my attitude. Hugh Gaitskell was well known for fighting and fighting again, and I stand by what I have done. As far as I am concerned, it does not matter 2 hoots what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> thinks. That is the simple answer. </para>

              <para>- It relates to health insurance. I do not know whether the Minister&#39;s attention has been drawn to it or whether his staff has given him a copy of the report of my speech. I am rising again because I am anxious that a reply be given. I mentioned then that concern was being felt in Victoria over this regulation. I express my view in relation to it, namely, that a clear distinction should be made between medical treatment and hospitalisation and other services. Specifically, this regulation has the effect of bringing surgeons under the control of a State Commission. In all probability in the future it will be a Federal Government commission. In my view this is tantamount to civil conscription. I ask that the Minister look carefully at this matter because it is something which is specifically banned under the Australian Constitution. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">No. 135, which relates to the designation of certain hospitals by the Health Insurance Commission and proscribes them so that Medibank benefits will not be payable to patients in those hospitals. I understand that the Government had a certain intention in bringing in those statutory rules. I would like to make it clear that 2 bodies have expressed considerable concern that the regulations may go further than the department intended. There is the opinion of counsel- at least 2 lots of counsel- that these regulations may have the effect of denying Medibank benefits for care given in intermediate and private beds in the hospitals named. There is no doubt that the spirit of the legislation was that Medibank benefits should be claimable by patients in intermediate and private beds. We are concerned that this might not be the case. I inform the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wheeldon)</inline> that we have today dispatched a telegram to his Department informing him of the concern felt by the Health and Welfare Committee of the Opposition Parties about the possibility that the regulation may have the effect of excluding from benefits private and intermediate patients who might rightfully think they are entitled to this cover for their medical care. We are extremely anxious that the Minister expedites an answer to our telegram, certainly before the Parliament resumes in August. </para>

            <para>- I should like to speak on the matter which has just been raised. I was not aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> was going to raise this matter tonight. It is obviously something which does not require a more detailed examination and a better answer than I can give off the cuff. I think the only thing that I could say at the moment is that obviously there are going to be problems in the introduction of Medibank as there are in any substantial social change of this nature. I am not altogether surprised that there are some things such as that which has just been raised, being drawn to my attention as Minister for Social Security. But I will certainly have this matter examined immediately together with the telegram to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> has referred which I take it has been sent to the Director-General of the Department of Social Security. He has not as yet drawn it to my attention. I will see that answers in writing are sent to both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> in connection with the matters that they have raised as soon as I can take proper advice. </para>

I pointed out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> that a number of Government senators had left the precincts of the House at 6 o&#39;clock and would not be here to take part in the proceedings. Therefore, there was no alternative as far as the Government was concerned but to continue with the proposition that the House resume its sitting on the subject of the cross-examination of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow. </para>

How ever, the frequency of the air freighter services was restricted at times during May because of airport runway repairs at Currie. </para>

            <para>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. Are reports correct that officers of the Trade Practices Commission, aided by the Commonwealth Police, raided a businessman&#39;s home and business premises and seized documents last weekend? Is not such action contrary to the Trade Practices Act which gives no power to seize documents and gives no authority whatsoever to the police? If so, are not raids of this character and the seizure of documents typical of the notorious dictatorships of this world? Is the Government now accepting that in this country a person&#39;s property and privacy may be invaded to discover evidence with which to convict him? In view of the fact that citizens appear to have no redress to the courts against invasions of this character, will the Minister table in the Senate the documents under which this invasion of privacy took place? </para>

            <para>On 25 May 1975 officers of the Australia Police Force, accompanied by officers of the Trade Practices Commission, entered certain premises and seized documents believed to constitute evidence of offences against the Trade Practices </para>
            <para class="block">Act 1974. The officers took this action pursuant to search warrants issued by a magistrate under section 10 of the Crimes Act 1914-1973 and the Chief Commissioner of the Australia Police is satisfied that they acted properly in all respects. Prosecution proceedings based in part on evidence obtained by the officers may shortly be instituted. Until prosecutions have been instituted it would be undesirable to table the warrants and thereby identify the persons whose premises were searched. </para>
